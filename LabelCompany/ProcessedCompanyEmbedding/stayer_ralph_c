revamping his management style by curtis hartman write a comment credit ralph stayer of johnsonville foods on the eightyear process of revamping his management style it started with a sixpage letter chief executive ralph c stayer wrote to the employees of johnsonville sausage in  things were going to change at the sheboygan falls wis manufacturer stayer now  told them he was committed to helping his employees learn how to work smarter so theyd become the best paid in the industry to get their attention stayer enclosed a  check in each letter the first of many bonuses he hoped theyd be able to earn as they took the thousands of little steps necessary to fix what was wrong with the business on its own the letter marked a modest change but that new compensation system was just the first step in an eightyear journey that would transform the company into a national management model celebrated in magazines and on television making stayer a celebrity of sorts stayer had worked on the slaughtering line at johnsonville during summers in high school and college he had studied business and finance at notre dame the first in his family to earn a degree and had joined the company founded by his parents in  upon graduation it was small with  million in sales from a few retail stores but stayer had plans  to make money and build the business he recalls with his parents blessing and help he broke off the manufacturing and wholesale sides of the company in  leaving the retail end under his parents control over the years he pushed sales up until they reached  million by  but the ceo wasnt happy quality and productivity were slipping so stayer started asking questions about himself and the company and about who should do what inspired by lee thayer a communications professor in the humanities department at the university of wisconsin stayer decided to turn johnsonville into a new kind of organization one step at a time by pushing decisions and responsibilities down the hierarchy destroying the conventional management structure along the way and inventing its replacement on the fly today the company now called johnsonville foods inc is one of those rare places where empowerment and teamwork go beyond mere rhetoric there are no general raises all employees are paid for performance with a regular pool of profits divided among them sales have gone from s  million to an estimated  million today and the companys share of the milwaukeearea market has gone from  to  productivity has increased between  and  stayer has moved gradually out of direct daytoday responsibility at the company over the past four years he has started a pasta business with more than  million in sales and has launched a consulting career teaching others the lessons he learned at johnsonville  a process he calls managing the journey of change this fall inc writers leslie brokaw and curtis hartman talked with stayer about the past eight years a time of continual change for him and his company   inc lets start back in  your company was doing  million a year up  since  with profits holding strong that sounds like most ceos picture of paradise stayer thats one way to look at it or you could look at it and say my god this business isnt healthy forget what the numbers look like people dont care   inc do you remember any specific moment when that realization hit you stayer it was a bunch of little things like walking around seeing equipment being dropped and seeing people talking in the aisles not committed at all then i ran an employeeattitude survey and we came out absolutely average here we were this rapidly growing company i thought everyone should be excited but the only one who was excited was me i wanted them to care but at the same time i didnt understand why they should what the heck i owned the business why would anybody care as much as i do i was a good boss friendly i knew all the names but we were there to make sausage and to make money for me   inc but the company was growing and making money what did you think youd get out of people caring more stayer i could see such a gap between what we could be and what we were the quality wasnt anywhere near as good as i wanted it to be second i wasnt having any fun i was a babysitter for all my executives i had to get them together to solve their problems do you know what causes frustration it isnt problems you get those all the time what causes frustration is knowing that  years from now nothing will have changed crap is just going to keep coming down and youll be there shuffling through it it was terrible we were doing all kinds of stuff and i couldnt see any improvement at all if anything our productivity was going down   inc what sort of stuff were you doing stayer oh modern management techniques more organization and supervision long before quality circles were popular i started meeting with groups of people and asking them their problems  so i could solve them i hired a quality control person with a lab and put in a quality program with lots of controls  and quality got worse not better i hired a human resources person with responsibility for training monitoring and systems and i put in more supervision but things still didnt get better the quality control person says we need more qc people so we can check more the manufacturing person says we need more supervision set a pace line they couldnt sell me on it wed added more supervision and we still couldnt get the job done there had to be something different i was ready for it   inc weve talked to hundreds of ceos and the number of those who would hire a humanities professor to be their business mentor is very small indeed stayer right because the ceo is supposed to be the guy with all the answers but lee thayer made sense he talked about communication  that real communication is who owns the problem his whole point was that its not my job to make them listen its my job to set it up so they want to listen get the problem in the right spot and communication gets real simple now ive come to believe that there isnt such a thing as a communication problem its a responsibilityisinthewrongspot problem   inc for example stayer shipments lost orders salespeople taking orders and then not letting the factory know the salesperson doesnt feel responsible for getting the shipment out so he doesnt bother to think who else needs to know about it to make sure it happens we could build systems for  years and we would never have enough to make people be responsible   inc and lee thayer helped you make your employees be more responsible stayer no he didnt he said it depends on you what are you willing to do are you willing to say that you have to change are you willing to understand that youre the problem we talked about what i was doing and what i wasnt doing i had no idea that what i did was to create what i had but i had made the decisions by gosh if you made a decision that was fine as long as you made it the way i would have made it   inc so it was a socratic dialogue stayer absolutely id ask questions and thayer would turn them back id always ask about this problem or that problem and hed ask me whose problem is that whose problem should that be ideally what would you want to have happen in this situation ideally where do you want the business to be three years from now you have to start with the best of all worlds given realistic constraints what would you like to create if you dont know where youre going you dont know when you get there and all roads are fine specificallywho do we want to be responsible for what how do we want people to feel about things how do we want them to be working together thayer always had me form pictures asking me what a great performance would look like he said do you want to be playing the trumpet or directing the orchestra i usually played the drums very loud   inc its one thing to decide you want everyone playing together like the philharmonic its much harder to get employees to take that on stayer you get people to take it on because it solves their problems and frustrations the real key to leadership is being able to combine the best interests of the group with the best interests of the individuals to make sure theyre all working with a common purpose its a process of finding opportunities to help people understand that by getting rid of their own frustrations theyre also making the business better continued inc thats fine in the abstract but with what specifics do you start stayer its not fixing any specific problem there are no recipes we want to fix the real problem which is having people understand they ought to be responsible for their own workplace take boom boxes people were coming to me and complaining that the music was too loud and they didnt want radios here well how am i going to solve that problem i cant   inc of course you can you can say that boom boxes are banned from johnsonville stayer so the few people who complained are happy and the rest who like the music are mad solomon couldnt solve that one but i can say thats your workplace you guys decide you solve this any way you want they start solving boombox problems pretty soon they start looking at other stuff that frustrates them about how the place operates   inc like what stayer one of the biggest frustrations was that new people coming in werent trained properly so they had to work with people who did a lousy job they said we gotta fix it and i said youre absolutely right and you guys know what these people need to know when they come in the hr department doesnt know so you guys can build a much better program train them another frustration is that they didnt like some of the people they had to work with so they took over the hiring and firing  they know better than i do what they need so whats left for hr with people taking over more and more of the responsibility to deal with their own frustrations what do you need a supervisor for people are supervising themselves   inc how did you divide the company up into the appropriate teams stayer i didnt why is that my problem they divided it up   inc that sounds like a prescription for chaos its fine to push authority down to the employees but you cant change a company that dramatically overnight stayer you change opportunistically the important thing is having a picture of what youd like the company to look like down the road i want the decisions made i want each person to know exactly what he or she needs to know to do a good job i would like this place to run with as few layers as possible i want each person to say my job is to make and keep customers and heres how i do it thats my vision so when someone comes to me with a problem i dont see that problem i see an opportunity how can we use that to get from here to there so the right people own the problem the people who are responsible should make the decisions you dont have to be responsible if someone else is making your decisions for you   inc so you draw up committees to talk about frustrations how do you convince them you are giving them the authority to make decisions that matter stayer it starts with little things and adds up like vending machines  they didnt like the vending machine company i said i dont even eat at the vending machines get whatever company you want there was a lot of fear then we had to help them interview the different companies and such the first couple of times but you dont make the decision your job is to transfer the ownership of the problem to where it belongs   inc it sounds easy enough with something like vending machines but what happens with bigger issues like quality stayer i wouldnt give up the quality stuff until they got good at the vending machines i dont like chaos we did a little bit at a time in the letter i first wrote to employees i talked about thousands of little steps acknowledging that were going to make lots of mistakes along the way and that anytime weve made a mistake were going to fix it   inc when you visualize the ideal company you say i want i want i want why should employees care what you want as long as they are doing their jobs stayer the only reason is if it is in their best interest   inc so the first thing you changed was the compensation system rather than acrosstheboard annual raises you started to pay for performance and added a bonus pool of  of the profits what were you trying to accomplish stayer in the best of all worlds we wanted people worrying about being productive wanting to be better performers second we wanted not to have to worry about how many people we had you want performance so you say were not going to pay people equally youd like everyones compensation to go down when the business doesnt do well too but its hard to take salary away from people so you make the bonus a portion of peoples compensation the average now is up to about  to  of compensation but our target is to get it to  to  we make a pool of dollars generated by profits thats going to be divided everyone understands that if weve got more people and we dont add profits the bonus isnt going to go up so adding profits with fewer people is everyones job now do you think we have a problem with automation where do you think our productivity gains come from they come from people understanding that its in their best interest   inc starting the change with peoples paychecks must have created a lot of concern about just how that money was going to be divided stayer there was a lot of concern i said look guys youve got to work it out youre concerned about all these things fine well sit down and work on how we do this   inc its your pot to divide stayer its your pot to divide but its got to add up to a couple of basics it cant be equal for everybody its got to reward performance for individuals and teams because its better performance that is going to make a difference in the size of the pot the key thing is not to design this in a vacuum get people together and say these are the things we need to reward figure out how to do it if i get them to design it i get them to make it work and to understand the underlying issues the real role of the ceo is to generate productive conversations about what performance ought to look like   inc how is that different from the traditional role of the ceo stayer the traditional role is as chief decision maker and strategist at the top of the hierarchy away from the daytoday your role is to think their role is to do but the key is not to have a strategic vision ideas are a dime a dozen the key is being able to execute that means a lot of people have to line up in a row wanting to do whatever it takes you dont have time to baby them or bludgeon them they just have to do it so your role is to make sure people see its in their own best interest to do that   inc isnt it faster to issue orders than to have a team of people come to a consensus stayer at one time it probably was when life was simpler but today it takes so many people working together to make anything happen how do you issue orders when youve got  different departments who have to come together all at once if you issue orders youre telling people dont think just do but if youve got  people youve got  minds and if you issue orders from the top youre using only  of them or  or one thats stupid   inc but what if i want the decisions made fast can you do fast stayer we do very fast much faster than the average because we dont have to have all the information flow up to the guy on top do you know how much time and effort it takes to get all that information up there do you know how many decisions are made poorly from that level theres a lot of ego in saying i am the guy who has to make the decision because i know better i was there i know   inc companies all over the country are trying the team concept and hitting the same roadblocks how do you keep teams on track how do you reward for new products how do you decide how much spending authority to give them how do you resolve disputes within a team stayer most companies that try teams are trying to graft new limbs onto a cadaver the management concept is no longer appropriate so the team is like a fleck of gold in a cesspool the only reason you set up a team is to accomplish something right so give the team work  make sure that every person on that team is really concerned about that work and doing it well move the ownership and responsibility toward where it needs to be at the point of action if theyre concerned you dont have to do another thing theyll get it done but if you dont do that i dont care how many systems how much structure how many newsletters pcs electronic systems whatever else you have it aint gonna work    inc arent you abdicating all your responsibility stayer not at all im keeping the major responsibility which is to make people great performers the conventional wisdom says that i have to control them i have to follow up on them i have to have them reporting to me but my job is to set it up so i can coach them to become great performers   inc what if they dont set the performance standards you want stayer groups of people set very high standards for themselves higher and higher the more chances they get they want the opportunity to learn and to grow to see that their jobs can be important and they can contribute theres a lot of talk about making people feel important i dont agree with that i think we have to make people be important  and know it people like to sign on to things they want to make a difference and be part of a winning team if theyre not doing it at work theyre out doing little league things or something in their church   inc you call your managers coaches what difference is there between asking management to manage and asking them to coach stayer none unless you absolutely change the nature of their jobs if you want people to coach then youd better reward coaching the bonus had better be developed on how well they build people the promotions had better be developed on how well they build people you darn well had better develop people   inc lets say i sign on to make sausage at your plant what would my workday be like stayer the whole concept is that we want each person to be a businessperson responsible for the financials and everything else so the people on the shop floor are responsible when the yearly budget gets done you and your team will put that together maybe with a financial person sitting in to help although weve been at it for five years now so people pretty much do it themselves every month you check out the stuff and record it with measurements for your performance your departments performance your teams performance on a daily or hourly basis depending on what processes have to be controlled tracked and charted   inc all this in addition to my job stayer that is your job its the same in sales those people managed their own budgets and expenses with discretion over what to spend for promotions demonstrations advertising or whatever we want to make them struggle with the issues and tradeoffs and we believe those are best handled at the point of action when you have a merchandiser who gets promoted to salesperson he or she hires a merchandiser as a replacement and the bonus is tied to the hire because i want them to know what happens if they make a mistake   inc how is the company set up is johnsonville organized by functional departments or product groups stayer neither we start with what does our customer want not what do we make we used to define our products by smoked cooked fresh  how we made them but company president mike roller said no were going to define them by how people use them when they use them why they use them we have four sets of customers retail food service processors and institutional so we got rid of our functional organization manufacturing and sales became services to the people who run the business  the people in charge of the retail group food service group etc thats where the business is done the rest of us are just support all our factories and sales staffs are just services that are being provided   inc and you got rid of the qc department along with human resources stayer we dont have an anything department functional organizations become so vested in their own processes that they dont see the rest of the business you wind up growing specialized idiots they can only make a decision that takes care of their department but not one that services the whole business thats why we talk team team team  if you have any department thats a department unto itself youre dead if you think that quality is important then youve got to get rid of your quality department  its got to become everybodys problem finally we told our qc department that there would be no more quality control it was going to be technical assistance your job is to eliminate your job to teach it to the people out there if you do it well give you a better job if you dont do it youll get different jobs  inc youve moved to a different job yourself away from the daytoday leadership of johnsonville on to your pasta startup and your consulting business was that your goal from the start stayer i dont think my goal was ever to step away my goal was to step back and not have to deal with the issues i was dealing with im still emotionally attached i live and breathe that company but it became apparent that to be the best help i had to get out of running the company on a daytoday basis   inc why stayer i was getting comfortable with it and the minute that happens i know that im becoming part of the problem again your guts have to be churning every now and then or youre not learning youre not pushing back the envelope i loved it but the well was starting to run dry i was facing the succession issue too i knew i had to get out of there to give other people the opportunity to see how well they understood the company the real job as ceo is to make sure the people coming after you are better i wanted to make sure that if something happened to me johnsonville would continue and i wanted to start that transition when i was  not  when id have only one chance i started the pasta company out on the east coast to get away but i still needed something more i got something out of the pasta company but that was duplicating johnsonville so i started my consulting firm to go on learning teaching a lot of people   inc if johnsonville stopped growing would you step back in stayer no as a stockholder and owner id ask the people there what they were going to do about it weve had bad years times when the rawmaterial market went through the roof and we couldnt pass the prices on but the people said lets start talking about what we have to do about it in fact were going through one of those times right now the numbers are horrible in the industry profits down  to  but our earnings are up substantially so it works

successful family business  johnsonville sausage that was in great shape and required radical change our profits were above the average for our industry and our financial statements showed every sign of health we were growing at a rate of about  annually with sales that were strong in our home state of wisconsin and steadily rising in minnesota michigan and indiana our quality was high we were respected in the community i was making a lot of money and i had a knot in my stomach that wouldnt go away for one thing i was worried about competition we were a small regional producer with national competitors who could out promote outadvertise and underprice us any time they chose in addition to our big national competitors we had a host of local and regional producers small enough to provide superior service to customers who were virtually their neighbors we were too big to have the smalltown advantage and too small to have advantages of national scale our business was more vulnerable than it looked what worried me more than the competition however was the gap between potential and performance our people didnt seem to care every day i came to work and saw people so bored by their jobs that they made thoughtless dumb mistakes they mislabeled products or added the wrong seasonings or failed to mix them into the sausage properly someone drove the prongs of a fork lift right through a newly built wall someone else ruined a big batch of fresh sausage by spraying it with water while cleaning the work area these were accidents no one was deliberately wasting money time and materials it was just that people took no responsibility for their work they showed up in the morning did halfheartedly what they were told to do and then went home now i didnt expect them to be as deeply committed to the company as i was i owned it and they didnt but how could we survive a serious competitive challenge with this low level of attentiveness and involvement getting to points b and a in  i began looking for a recipe for change i started by searching for a book that would tell me how to get people to care about their jobs and their company not surprisingly the search was fruitless no one could tell me how to wake up my own work force i would have to figure it out for myself and yet i told myself why not i had made the company so i could fix it this was an insight filled with pitfalls but it was an insight the fault was not someone elses the fault was mine of course i hadnt really built the company all alone but i had created the management style that kept people from assuming responsibility of course it was counterproductive for me to own all the companys problems by myself but in  every problem did in fact rest squarely on my shoulders weighing me down and  though i didnt appreciate it at the time  crippling my subordinates and strangling the company if i was going to fix what i had made i would have to start by fixing myself in many ways that was my good luck or to put the same thought another way thank god i was the problem so i could be the solution as i thought about what i should do i first asked myself what i needed to do to achieve the companys goals but what were the companys goals what did i really want johnsonville to be i didnt know this realization led me to a second insight nothing matters more than a goal the most important question any manager can ask is in the best of all possible worlds what would i really want to happen i tried to picture what johnsonville would have to be to sell the most expensive sausage in the industry and still have the biggest market share what i saw in my minds eye was definitely not an organization where i made all the decisions and owned all the problems what i saw was an organization where people took responsibility for their own work for the product for the company as a whole if that happened our product and service quality would improve our margins would rise and we could reduce costs and successfully enter new markets johnsonville would be much less vulnerable to competition the image that best captured the organizational end state i had in mind for johnsonville was a flock of geese on the wing i didnt want an organizational chart with traditional lines and boxes but a v of individuals who knew the common goal took turns leading and adjusted their structure to the task at hand geese fly in a wedge for instance but land in waves most important each individual bird is responsible for its own performance with that end state in mind as point b the goal i turned to the question of our starting point point a johnsonville was financially successful but i was dissatisfied with employee attitudes so i conducted an attitude survey to find out what people thought about their jobs and the company and to get an idea of how they perceived the companys attitude toward them i knew there was less commitment than i wanted but i was startled all the same to find that johnsonville attitudes were only average  no better than employee attitudes at big impersonal companies like general motors at first i didnt want to believe the survey and i looked for all kinds of excuses the methodology was faulty the questions were poorly worded i didnt want to admit that we had an employee motivation problem because i didnt know how to deal with that but however strong the temptation the mistakes and poor performance were too glaring to ignore the survey told me that people saw nothing for themselves at johnsonville it was a job a means to some end that lay outside the company i wanted them to commit themselves to a company goal but they saw little to commit to and at that stage i still couldnt see that the biggest obstacle to changing their point of view was me everything i had learned and experienced to that point had convinced me that anything i didnt do myself would not be done right as i saw it my job was to create the agenda and then motivate them to carry it out in fact i expected my people to follow me the way buffalo follow their leader  blindly unfortunately that kind of leadership model almost led to the buffalos extinction buffalo hunters used to slaughter the herd by finding and killing the leader once the leader was dead the rest of the herd stood around waiting for instructions that never came and the hunters could land did exterminate them one by one i realized that i had been focused entirely on the financial side of the business  margins market share re turn on assets  and had seen people as dutiful tools to make the business grow the business had grown  nicely  and that very success was my biggest obstacle to change i had made all the decisions about purchasing scheduling quality pricing marketing sales hiring and all the rest of it now the very things that had brought me success  my centralized control my aggressive behavior my authoritarian business practices  were creating the environment that made me so unhappy i had been johnsonville sausage assisted by some hired hands who to my annoyance lacked commitment but why should they make a commitment to johnsonville they had no stake in the company and no power to make decisions or control their own work if i wanted to improve results i had to increase their involvement in the business this was an insight that i immediately misused acting on instinct i ordered a change from now on i announced to my management team youre all responsible for making your own decisions i went from authoritarian control to authoritarian abdication no one had asked for more responsibility i forced it down their throats they were good soldiers and they did their best but i had trained them to expect me to solve their problems i had nurtured their inability by expecting them to be incapable now they met my expectations with an inability to make decisions unless they knew which decisions i wanted them to make after more than two years of working with them i finally had to replace all three top managers worst of all i now see that in a way they were right i didnt really want them to make independent decisions i wanted them to make the decisions i would have made deep down i was still in love with my own control i was just making people guess what i wanted instead of telling them and yet i had to replace those three managers i needed people who didnt guess so well people who couldnt read my mind people strong enough to call my bluff and seize ownership of johnsonvilles problems whether i really wanted to give it up or not i spent those two years pursuing another mirage as well  detailed strategic and tactical plans that would realize my goal of johnsonville as the worlds greatest sausage maker we triedto plan organizational structure two to three years before it would be needed  who would be responsible for what and who would report to whom all care fully diagramed in boxes and lines on charts later i realized that these structural changes had to grow from daytoday working realities no one could dictate them from above and certainly not in advance but at the time my business training told me this was the way to proceed the discussions went on at an abstract level for months the details overwhelmed us and we got nowhere in short the early s were a disaster after two years of stewing it began to dawn on me that my first reactions to most situations were usually dead wrong after all my organizational instincts had brought us to point a to begin with pursuing those instincts now would only bring us back to point a i needed to start thinking before i acted and the thought i needed to think was will this action help us achieve our new point b point b also needed some revision the early s taught me that i couldnt give responsibility people had to expect it want it even demand it so my end state needed redefining the goal was not so much a state of shared responsibility as an environment where people insist on being responsible to bring people to that new point b i had to learn to be a better coach it took me additional years to learn the art of coaching by which in a nutshell i mean communicating a vision and then getting people to see their own behavior harness their own frustrations and own their own problems early in the change process for example i was told that workers in one plant disliked working weekends which they often had to do to meet deliveries suspecting that the weekends werent really necessary i pressed plant managers to use the problem as an opportunity i asked them if they had measured production efficiency for instance and if they had tried to get their workers to take responsibility for the overtime problem the first thing everyone discovered was that machine down time hovered between  and  then they started coming to terms with the fact that all that downtime had its causes  lateness absences sloppy maintenance slow shift startups once the workers began to see that they themselves were the problem they realized that they could do away with weekend work in three weeks they cut downtime to less than  and had saturdays and sundays off managing the context the debacle of ordering change and watching it fail to occur showed me my limitations i had come to realize that i didnt directly control the performance of the people at johnsonville that as a manager i didnt really manage people they managed themselves but i did manage the context i provided and allocated the resources i designed and implemented the systems i drew up and executed the organizational structure the power of any contextual factor lies in its ability to shape the way people think and what they expect so i worked on two contextual areas systems and structures systems i first attacked our quality control system quality was central to our business success one of our key competitive advantages but even though our quality was better than average it wasnt yet good enough to be great we had the traditional quality control department with the traditional quality control responsibilities  catching errors before they got to the customer senior management was a part of the system several times a week we evaluated the product  that is to say we checked it  for taste flavor color and texture one day it struck me that by checking the product top management had assumed responsibility for its quality we were not encouraging people to be responsible for their own performance we were not helping people commit themselves to making johnsonville a great company this line of reasoning led me to another insight the first strategic decision i needed to make was who should make decisions on the theory that those who implement a decision and live with its consequences are the best people to make it we changed our quality control system top management stopped tasting sausage and the people who made sausage started we informed line workers that from now on it would be their responsibility to make certain that only topquality product left the plant in the future they would manage quality control it surprised me how readily people accepted this ownership they formed teams of workers to resolve quality problems for example one team attacked the problem of leakers  vacuumpacked plastic packages of sausage that leaked air and shortened shelf life the team gathered data identified problems worked with suppliers and with other line workers to develop and implement solutions even visited retail stores to find out how retailers handled the product so we could make changes that would prevent their problems from occurring the team took complete responsibility for measuring quality and then used those measurements to improve production processes they owned and expected to own all the problems of producing topquality sausage and they wanted to do the best possible job the results were amazing rejects fell from  to less than  clearly this new quality control system was helping to create the end state we were after its success triggered changes in several other systems as well teams of workers in other areas began to taste the product every morning and discuss possible improvements they asked for information about costs and customer reactions and we redesigned the information system to give it to them we began to forward customer letters directly to line workers they responded to customer complaints and sent coupons for free johnsonville sausage when they felt it was warranted they came to own and expect responsibility for correcting the problems that customers raised in their letters people in each section on the shop floor began to collect data about labor costs efficiency and yield they posted the data and discussed it at the daily tasting meeting increasingly people asked for more responsibility and the information system encouraged them to take it we were progressing toward our end state and as we made progress we uncovered deeper and more complex problems one of these arose when people on the shop floor began to complain about fellow workers whose performance was still slipshod or indifferent  in fact they came to senior management and said you dont take your own advice if you did you wouldnt let these poor performers work here its your job to either fix them or fire them our first reaction was to jump in and do something but by now we had learned to think before acting we asked ourselves if accepting responsibility for this problem would help us reach point b the answer was clearly no more important we asked ourselves who was in the best position to own the problem and came to the obvious conclusion that the people on the shop floor knew more about shopfloor performance than we did so they were the best ones to make these decisions we offered to help them set performance standards and to coach them in confronting poor performers but we insisted that since they were the productionperformance experts it was up to them to deal with the situation i bit my tongue time and time again but they took on the responsibility for dealing with performance problems and actually fired individuals who wouldnt perform up to the standards of their teams this led to a dramatic change in johnsonvilles human resource system convinced that inadequate selection and training of new workers caused performance problems line workers asked to do the selection and training themselves managers helped them set up selection and training procedures but production workers made them work eventually line workers assumed most of the traditional personnel functions the compensation system was another early target for change we had traditionally given acrosstheboard annual raises like most other businesses what mattered was longevity not performance that system was also a stumbling block on our way to point b so we made two changes first we eliminated the annual acrosstheboard raise and substituted a payforresponsibility system as people took on new duties  budgeting for instance or training  they earned additional base income where the old system rewarded people for hanging around regardless of what they contributed the new one encouraged people to seek responsibility second we instituted what we called a company performance share a fixed percentage of pretax profits to be divided every six months among our employees we based individual shares on a performanceappraisal system designed and administered by a volunteer team of line production workers from various departments the system is explained in the insert how johnsonville shares profits on the basis of performance these system changes taught me two more valuable lessons first just start dont wait until you have all the answers when i set out to make these changes had no clear picture of how these new systems would interact with one another or with other company systems and procedures but if i had waited until i had all the answers id still be waiting a grand plan was impossible there were too many variables i wasnt certain which systems to change i just knew i had to change something in order to alter expectations and begin moving toward my goal second start by changing the most visible system you directly control you want your first effort to succeed i knew i could control who tasted the product because i was doing the tasting i also knew it was a highly visible action everyone waited to hear my tastetest results by announcing that i wasnt going to taste the product anymore and that the people who made it were everyone knew immediately that i was serious about spreading responsibility structures along with the system changes i introduced a number of changes in company structure teams gradually took over a number of the functions previously performed by individual managers in the chain of command with the result that the number of hierarchical layers went from six to three teams had already taken on responsibility for selecting training evaluating and when necessary terminating fellow employees now they began to make all decisions about schedules performance standards assignments budgets quality measures and capital improvements as well in operations teams assumed the supervisors functions and those jobs disappeared those former supervisors who needed authority in order to function left the company but most went into other jobs at johnsonville some of them into technical positions the function of the quality control department was redefined it stopped checking quality  now done by lineworkers  and began providing technical support to the production people in a cooperative effort to improve quality the department developed systems for continuous online monitoring of fat moisture and protein content for example and it launched a program of outside taste testing among customers the traditional personnel department disappeared and was replaced by a learning and personal development team to help individual employees develop their own points b and a  their destinations and starting points  and figure out how to use johnsonville to reach their goals we set up an educational allowance for each person to be used however the individual saw fit in the beginning some took cooking or sewing classes a few took flying lessons over time however more and more of the employees focused on job related learning today more than  of all the people at johnsonville are involved in some type of formal education the end state we all now envision for johnsonville is a company that never stops learning one part of learning is the acquisition of facts and knowledge  about accounting machine maintenance marketing even about sky diving and italian cooking but the most important kind of learning teaches us to question our own actions and behavior in order to better understand the ways we perform work and live helping human beings fulfill their potential is of course a moral responsibility but its also good business life is aspiration learning striving people are happy people and good workers they have initiative and imagination and the companies the work for are rarely caught napping learning is change and i keep learning and relearning that change is and needs to be continuous for example our system and structural changes were reciprocal the first led to the second which then in turn led to new versions of the first initially i had hoped the journey would be as neat and orderly as it now appears on paper fortunately  since original mistakes are an important part of learning  it wasnt there were lots of obstacles and challenges much backsliding and myriad false starts and wrong decisions for example team leaders chosen by their team members were supposed to function as communication links leaving the traditional management functions of planning and scheduling to the group itself no sooner had the team leaders been appointed however than they began to function as supervisors in other words they immediately fell into the familiar roles they had always seen we had neglected to give them and the plant managers adequate training in the new team model the structure changed but mindsets didnt it was harder to alter peoples expectations than i had realized influencing expectations i discovered that change occurs in fits and starts and that while i could plan individual changes and events i couldnt plan the whole process i also learned that expectations have a way of becoming reality so i tried to use every available means  semantic symbolic and behavioral  to send messages that would shape expectations to johnsonvilles advantage for example we wanted to break down the traditional pictures in peoples minds of what managers do and how subordinates and employees be have so we changed the words we used we dropped the words employee and subordinate instead we called everyone a member of the organization and managers became coordinators or coaches our promotion system had always sent a powerful message to move up the ladder you need to become a manager and solve problems for your people but this was now the wrong message i wanted coordinators who could build problemsolving capacities in others rather than solve their problems for them i recast the job requirements for the people whose work i directly coordinated formerly known as my management team and they in turn did the same for the people whose work they coordinated i took every opportunity to stress the need for coaching skills and i continually deemphasized technical experience whenever someone became a coordinator i made sure word got around that the promotion was for demonstrated abilities as a teacher coach and facilitator this new promotion standard sent a new message to get ahead at johnsonville you need a talent for cultivating and encouraging problem solvers and responsibility takers i discovered that people watched every action to see if it supported undermined our vision they wanted to see if i practiced what i preached from the outset i did simple things to demonstrate my sincerity i made a sign for my desk that said the question is the answer and when people came to me with questions i asked myself if they were questions i should answer invariably they werent invariably people were asking me to make decisions for them instead of giving answers i turned the tables and asked the questions myself trying to make them repossess their own problems owning problems was an important part of the end state id envisioned i wasnt about to let people give theirs to me i also discovered that in meetings people waited to hear my opinion before offering their own in the beginning i insisted they say what they thought unaware that i showed my own preferences in subtle ways  my tone of voice the questions i asked  which nevertheless anyone could read and interpret expertly when i realized what was happening i began to stay silent to avoid giving any clue to where i stood the result was that people flatly refused to commit themselves to any decision at all some of those meetings would have gone on for days if i hadnt forced people to speak out before theyd read my mind in the end i began scheduling my self out of many meetings forcing others to make their decisions with out me i also stopped collecting data about production problems i learned that if i had information about daily shortages and yields i began to ask questions that put me firmly back in possession of the problems eventually i came to understand that everything i did and said had a symbolic as well as a literal meaning i had to anticipate the potential impact of every word and act ask my self again and again if what i was about to do or say would reinforce the vision or undermine it bring us closer to point b or circle us back to point a encourage people to own their own problems or palm them off on me my job as i had come to see it was to put myself out of a job watershed by mid we had all come a long way johnsonville members had started wanting and expecting responsibility for their own performance and they usually did a good job return on assets was up significantly as were margins and quality but on the whole the process of change had been a journey without any major mileposts or station stops then palmer sausage not its real name came along and gave us our watershed  a golden opportunity and a significant threat to our existence palmer is a much larger sausage company that had contracted with us for privatelabel products during a strike in the early s our quality was so high that they kept us on as a supplier after the strike ended now palmer had decided to consolidate several facilities and offered to let us take over part of the production of a plant they were closing it represented a huge increase in their order and the additional business was very tempting it could be very profitable and it would justify the cost of a new and more efficient plant of our own the upside was extremely attractive  if we could handle it that was what worried me to handle an expanded palmer contract wed have to hire and train a large group of people quickly and teach our present people new skills keep quality high on both the palmer products and our own work six and seven days a week for more than a year until our new plant was ready and run the risk if palmer canceled  which it could do on days notice  of saddling ourselves with big layoffs and new capacity we no longer had a market for maybe it wasnt a betthecompany decision but it was as close as id like to come before  i would have met for days with my senior team to discuss all these issues and we would probably have turned down the opportunity in the face of such an overwhelming downside but by  it was clear to me that the executive group was the wrong group to make this decision the executives would not be responsible for successfully implementing such a move the only way we could do palmer successfully was if everyone at johnsonville was committed to making it work so everyone had to decide until that moment my senior team had always made the strategic decisions we took advice from people in the operating departments but the senior staff and i had dealt with the ultimate problems and responsibilities we needed to move to a new level this was a problem all of our people had to own my senior managers and i called a meeting of the entire plant presented the problem and posed three questions what will it take to make it work is it possible to reduce the downside do we want to do it we asked the teams in each area to discuss these questions among themselves and develop a list of pros and cons since the group as a whole was too large to work together effectively each team chose one member to report its findings to a plantwide representative body to develop a plantwide answer the small groups met almost immediately and within days their representatives met the discussion moved back and forth several times between the representative body and the smaller groups to make it work the members decided wed have to operate seven days a week hire and train people to take new shifts and increase efficiency to get more from current capacity they also thought about the downside risk the biggest danger was that wed lose the added business after making all the investments and sacrifices needed to handle it they figured the only way to reduce that downside potential was to achieve quality standards so high that we would actually improve the already firstrate palmer product and at the same time maintain standards on our own products to make sure johnsonville brands didnt fall by the wayside two weeks later the company decided almost unanimously to take the business it was one of the proudest moments of my life left to our traditional executive decision making we would have turned palmer down the johnsonville people believing in themselves rose to the challenge they really did want to be great the results surpassed our best projections learning took place faster than anticipated quality rose in our own product line as well as for palmer the new plant came on line in  palmer has come back to us several times since to increase the size of its orders even further success  the greatest enemy the pace of change increased after palmer now that all of johnsonvilles people expected and wanted some degree of responsibility for strategic decisions we had to redefine point a our current situation the new level of involvement also led us to a more ambitious view of what we could ultimately achieve  point b our vision and destination we made additional changes in our careertracking system in our early enthusiasm we had played down the technical aspects of our business encouraging everyone to become a coordinator even those who were far better suited to technical specialties we also had some excellent sales people who became coordinators because they saw it as the only path to advancement though their talents and interests lay much more in selling than in coaching when they be came coordinators we lost in three ways we lost good salespeople we created poor coordinators and we lost sales from other good salespeople because they worked for these poor coordinators a career team recommended that johnsonville set up dual career tracks  one for specialists and one for coordinators  that would enable both to earn recognition status and compensation on the basis of performance alone the team not the senior coordinators agreed to own and fix the compensation problem everyone at johnsonville discovered they could do considerably better and earn considerably more than they had imagined since they had little trouble meeting the accelerated production goals that they themselves had set members raised the minimum acceptable performance criteria and began routinely to expect more of themselves and others right now teams of johnsonville members are meeting to discuss next years capital budget new product ideas todays production schedule and yesterdays quality cost and yield more important these same teams are redesigning their systems and structures to manage their continuing journey toward point b which along with point a they are also continually redefining most important of all their general level of commitment is now as high or higher than my own in fact our greatest enemy now is our success our sales margins quality and productivity far exceed any thing we could have imagined in  weve been studied and written about and weve spent a lot of time answering questions and giving advice weve basked in the limelight telling other people how we did it all the time we kept telling our selves we cant let this go to our heads but of course it had already gone to our heads we had begun to talk and brag about the past instead of about what we wanted for the future once we saw what we were doing we managed to stop and in the process learn a lesson about the hazards of selfcongratulation when i began this process of change ten years ago i looked for ward to the time when it would all be over and i could get back to my real job but ive learned that change is the real job of every effective business leader because change is about the present and the future not about the past there is no end to change this story is only an interim report yet another thing ive learned is that the cause of excitement at johnsonville sausage is not change itself but the process used in producing change learning and responsibility are invigorating and aspirations make our hearts beat for the last five years my own aspiration has been to eliminate my job by creating such a crowd of selfstarting problemsolving responsibility grabbing independent thinkers that johnsonville would run itself two years ago i hired a new chief operating officer and told him he should lead the company and think of me as his paid consultant earlier this year he invited me to a management retreat and i enjoyed myself other people owned the problems that had once been mine my whole job was to generate productive conversations about johnsonvilles goals and to communicate its vision on the second evening of the retreat i was given a message from my coo there was a special session the next morning he wrote and added i want you there at  instinctively it made me mad johnsonville was my company i built it i fixed it he owed me his job who the hell did he think he was giving me orders like a hired consultant then of course i laughed its not always easy giving up control even when its what youve worked toward for ten years he wanted me there at  well good for him id be there johnsonville foods inc company performanceshare evaluation form please check one self

performance every six months we evaluate the performance of every one at johnsonville to help us compute shares in our profitsharing program except we is the wrong word in practice performance evaluations are done by the employees themselves for example  wage earners  salaried employees have a separate profitsharing pool and a different evaluation system  fill out forms in which they rate themselves on a scale of  to  in  specific areas grouped into three categories performance teamwork and personal development scores of   or   the average range  are simply entered on the proper line low scores of i or  and high scores of  to  require a sentence or two of explanation each members coach fills out an identical form and later both people sit down together and discuss all  areas in cases of disagreement the rule is only that their overall point totals must agree within nine points whereupon the two totals are averaged to reach a final score if they cannot narrow the gap to nine points an arbitration group is ready to step in and help but so far mediation has never been needed all final scores names deleted are then passed to a profitsharing team that carves out five categories of performance a small group of superior perormers about  of the total a larger group of better thanaverage workers roughly  an average group amounting to about  of the total work force a belowaverage group of  and a small group of poor performers who are often in some danger of losing their jobs the total pool of profits to be shared is then divided by the number of workers to find an average share  for the purpose of illustration lets say  members of the top group get a check for  of that amount or  members of the next group get   of the large middle group  or l and so on down to  and  yes people do complain from time to time especially if they think theyve missed a higher share by only a point or two the usual way of dealing with such situations is to help the individual improve his or her performance in enough areas to ensure a higher score the next time but overall satisfaction with the system is very high partly because fellow workers invented it administer it and constantly revise it in an effort to make it more equitable the person currently in charge of the johnsonville profitsharing team is an hourly worker from the shipping department many forms have been used over the years  a new one is under consideration at this moment  but the questions most recently asked in a slightly edited version are re printed in this article ralph stayers guide to improving performance getting better performance from any group or individual yourself included means a permanent change in the way you think and run your business change of this kind is not a single transaction but a journey and the journey has a specific starting point and a clear destination the journey is based on six observations about human behavior that i didnt fully grasp when i started though id have made faster progress and fewer mistakes if i had  people want to be great if they arent its because management wont let them be  performance begins with each individuals expectations influence what people expect and you influence how people perform  expectations are driven partly by goals vision symbols semantics and partly by the context in which people work that is by such things as compensation systems production practices and decisionmaking structures  the actions of managers shape expectations  learning is a process not a goal each new insight creates a new layer of potential insights  the organizations results reflect me and my performance if i want to change the results i have to change myself first this is particularly true for me the owner and ceo but it is equally true for every employee so to make the changes that will lead to great performance i recommend focusing on goals expectations contexts actions and learning lee thayer a humanities professor at the university of wisconsin has another way of saying pretty much the same thing he argues that since performance is the key to organizational success managements job is to establish the conditions under which superb performance serves both the companys and the individuals best interests ceos need to focus first on changing themselves before they try to change the rest of the company the process resembles an archaeological dig or at least it did for me as i uncovered and solved one problem i almost invariably exposed another deeper problem as i gained one insight and mastered one situation
