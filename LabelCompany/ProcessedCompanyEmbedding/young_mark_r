event quotes by mark r levin “where utopianism is advanced through gradualism rather than revolution albeit steady and persistent as in democratic societies it can deceive and disarm an unsuspecting population which is largely content and passive it is sold as reforming and improving the existing societys imperfections and weaknesses without imperiling its basic nature under these conditions it is mostly ignored dismissed or tolerated by much of the citizenry and celebrated by some transformation is deemed innocuous wellintentioned and perhaps constructive but not a dangerous trespass on fundamental liberties” ― mark r levin ameritopia the unmaking of america tags deception gradualism utopianism  likes like “the conservative does not despise government he despises tyranny this is precisely why the conservative reveres the constitution and insists on adherence to it” ― mark r levin liberty and tyranny a conservative manifesto  likes like “utopianism also finds a receptive audience among the societys disenchanted disaffected dissatisfied and maladjusted who are unwilling or unable to assume responsibility for their own real or perceived conditions but instead blame their surroundings the system and others they are lured by the false hopes and promises of utopian transformation and the criticisms of the existing society to which their connection is tentative or nonexistent improving the malcontents lot becomes linked to the utopian cause moreover disparaging and diminishing the successful and accomplished becomes an essential tactic no one should be better than anyone else regardless of the merits or values of his contributions by exploiting human frailties frustrations jealousies and inequities a sense of meaning and selfworth is created in the malcontents otherwise unhappy and directionless life simply put equality in misery  that is equality of result or conformity  is advanced as a just fair and virtuous undertaking liberty therefore is inherently immoral except where it avails equality” ― mark r levin ameritopia the unmaking of america tags inequality malcontents utopianism  likes like see all mark r levins quotes » topics
