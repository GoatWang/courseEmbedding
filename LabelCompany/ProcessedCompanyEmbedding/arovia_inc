check out their frequently asked questions pagehttpswwwthunderclapitfaq  august   alexander wesley why vrar may not be the next big thing august   alexander wesley htc vive virtual reality vr and augmented reality ar are two technologies that some prognosticators think could be the next big thing  virtual reality is a display that you put on your head that completely obscures your vision and immerses you in an activity eg gaming which is currently the most widespread use case for vr  the two most prominent virtual reality systems are the htc vive and the oculus rift  augmented reality overlays digital information on the physical world eg pokemon go  many companies are developing systems that go on your head like the microsoft hololens to create a head mounted augmented reality experience     while at arovia we think vr and ar are cool we obviously think there is plenty room for displays that everyone can see and don’t require putting something on your head like spud  additionally for many vrar applications like gaming there is a need for a supplemental display and spud is perfect for that  based on interviewing thousands of you and our own research here’s  reasons why vr and ar may not be the next big thing despite the billions of dollars being spent stereoscope historical evidence that head mounted displays fail eg stereoscopes d tvs google glassone of the earliest examples of head mounted display failure is stereographic viewers eg stereoscopes  stereoscopes came to prominence in the ’s along with traditional cameras and photographs  unlike traditional camera images with stereo camera and stereo camera you could see in psuedo d using the parallax effect  cool right well it turns out overwhelmingly the public referred traditional d images due to the ease of use for both taking pictures being able to view images without putting something up their head and being able to easily enjoy the viewing of pictures with others instead of taking turns more recently both d tv’s and google glass prominently failed to gain widespread adoption further demonstrating that a lot of people do not want to put extra hardware on their head to consume and create content steep hardware requirements vr  requires high end computing systems due to the massive amount of high resolution data needed  remember with arvr you are putting the display right next to your head which means if the pixels are not super dense it detracts from the experience unlike spud which you use farther away like a traditional tv or desktop monitor  these high end requirements mean there is a large barrier to entry thousands of dollars and make these systems nonportable  social and anthropological barrierslet’s face it what enabled humans to take over the world was our social tendencies as described in the interesting book sapiens  vrar obscure our interactions and place another barrier between us and each other  ultimately we are better off when we interact with each other and do not retreat into our own world though it is sometimes good to get away once in a while   when seeing the explosion of vr companies at south by southwest this year what struck us the most was just how weird people looked using vr and aradditionally many places have banned google glass due to head mounted displays being incongruent with our cultural norms  the social and anthropological might very well be the bottleneck in vr and ar adoption you look weird using it well there you have it our  reasons   the history of consumer rejection of head mounted displays  steep hardware requirements  socialanthropological barrierswhat do you think    july   justin mintzer how to reduce stress as a traveling professional july   justin mintzer do you find it difficult to get things done while on the road  do you dread the stress of a business trip  if so you’re not alone  in a  cwt solutions group study researchers found that the major stress factors can be grouped into  main categorieslost time situation in which work is difficult or impossible eg flying economy on long haulsurprises when an unforeseen event occurs eg lost or delayed baggageroutine breakers inability to maintain one’s habits eg unable to eat healthily at destinationthere are a few relatively simple things you can do to address these factors and reduce the stressful impact they can have  we have compiled a list based on lots of feedback from frequent business travelers  pack wisely  many people pack at the last minute and don’t put much thought into it  however there are lots of potential stress factors that can be avoided with a little bit of planning  first if possible don’t check bags  this allows you to skip the baggage delays and to completely avoid the risk of the alwaysdreaded lost bag which ensures a stressful trip  when packing take a few minutes to look up wrinklefree packing tips on the internet for example how to fold a suit since time not ironing is time that can be used productively  it also helps to store small items in a predesignated location in your suitcase your cables connectors dongles devices and anything else that can be easily lost or misplaced  don’t forget to pack for weather since time to go buy a warm jacket or an umbrella can add another layer of stress  arrange for voice and internet access before you go  getting stuck without access will seriously limit your productivity and add to your stress level  make sure you have a plan in advance  confirm that the hotel has wifi and come up with a “plan b” if it doesn’t for example tethering your laptop to your cellphone  for international travelers understand what it takes to get your cellphone working in your country of destination and get it all set up in advance exercise and eat on schedule  don’t let the trip derail your normal exercise routine  yes the schedule is tight and it’s easy to think that skipping your  min morning jog makes sense or that there’s no time for breakfast  however not only will that throw you off your routine it will also reduce your overall energy throughout the day  it’s okay to call the hotel in advance to find out what kind of exercise options they have or even bring your own portable exercise equipment  food is just as important  sticking with your exercise and eating routines will keep your energy up and allow you to be productive which will help keep that stress down  and of course keep hydrateddon’t forget your medicines  when you’re trying to be productive nothing can add to your stress quite like a bad headache or an allergy attack  it never hurts to be prepared  bring little medicine packs just in caseunderstand or determine your perfect jet lag curve  for those longer trips that span multiple timezones learn how your body reacts to jet lag and plan around it  maybe an early morning flight works best for you  maybe a redeye flight gives you the opportunity to get your sleep on the plane  this one is a bit more trial and error but for a good starting tip only sleep if it’s nighttime at your destination  this will keep you from getting into a bad cycle and allow you to adjust more quickly to the destination time create an office space  working directly from the hotel bed sounds nice and relaxing but it just isn’t a productive space especially when you fall asleep  set up a real workstation at the room desk in the business center or even at a local library  use a spud to give you that productivitymaximizing dualscreen setup anywhere you choose to work  make sure to bring a portable and comfortable mouse to use  if you’re sensitive to ambient noise or just in case they give you a room right next to the elevator it’s not a bad idea to have some noisecancelling headphones on hand to really create a distractionfree environmentconsider being loyal to a business  if you can stick to a single airline or hotel chain you may be able to earn some significant loyalty rewards from firstclass seats on the plane to an upgraded hotel room  if you’re not the one making the travel plans consider using a credit card with rewards during the trip to give yourself that little extra bonus  charge everything  if you want to keep productivity up on the plane or even during taxi rides make sure all of your mobile devices are fully charged in advance  that includes your laptop cellphone wireless keyboard or mouse spud wireless headphones and anything else with a battery give yourself rewards  remember to reward yourself if you can get x and y done on the plane you’ll have time to go see the world’s largest ball of twine on saturday morning  setting goals keeps you productive and rewarding yourself will certainly help to manage that stress june   justin mintzer which video app is right for you june   justin mintzer everyone needs a great video player app  this will be especially true for you when you get your hands on a spud and have a big screen anywhere you want   this week we decided to take a look at the best apps out there to give you a summary of your options  we’ve focused on apps that play all the major video file formats and have not included the major streaming services like youtube and netflix you should have those already anyway  the chart below gives a high level comparison of the major strengths of different video apps available today kids lock swipe gesture support multicore decoding hw acceleration network streaming floating window support android ios open source ad free google play rating  reviewers as of  archos video player x x x   bsplayer x x x x x x   gplayer x x x x x   kmplayer x x x x x   kodi x x x x x x   moboplayer x x x x   mx player x x x x x x   vlc player x x x x x x x x   archos video player – with some advanced features like network playback support and subtitle downloader archos video player is a solid video option  however it really shines because of its impressive library view and automatic retrieval of series or movie details and artwork  if you’re looking for a great way to browses through your collection archos video player is worth a trybsplayer – this app stands out with a variety of skins you can use to really customize the look of your app  gesture support and its “pop out” viewer give the user some advanced options within a very simple user interfacegplayer – gplayer has become known as one of the first players to support playing multiple windows in windowed mode which means users can view multiple windows simultaneously  another lesser known feature is the groups sharing capability which enables media file sharing over wifi directly through the app itself  if you’re always sharing media files with your friends take a look at gplayerkmplayer – as very popular video player the kmplayer has lots of fans out there already  other than being a solid video player kmplayer gets additional points for its builtin cloud support you can natively view content stored in google drivekodi – one of two open source players on this list kodi is a featurepacked portable media hub formerly known as xbmc for you xbox fans out there  while it might be a big intimidating to set up it has tons of features and a rich developer and user community to back it up  if you don’t mind getting a bit technical kodi might be just what you’re looking formoboplayer – moboplayer while it’s a relatively small competitor claims its spot on this list because of its extensive support of video file formats  it handles those less popular ones that not all players support through software decoding  if you’re looking for a player that can play that one mystery file give moboplayer a trymx player – it would be tough to find a list on the internet that doesn’t mention mx player as one of the best video apps available  it is a reliable player that is extremely stable full of great features and file format support  if you trust the internet mob and we usually do you can’t go wrong with mx playervlc – finally there’s vlc player  this open source player made a name for itself as a media player on pcs and it has now moved into the mobile space  while some folks out there claim that this player is still a bit buggy it can play virtually any video format out there right “out of the box”  it has some great features and a strong support community  if you want to impress your computersavvy friends and you can deal with a bug here and there go with vlc june   justin mintzer just how important is the projection screen june   justin mintzer we all know that guy in college that had the projector setup in his dorm room  it was fun for parties and great for playing movies in the background but the picture never looked that great  the projected image always looked washed out and you could see every dent and scratch on the wall  but movies shown in theaters today use projectors and they look amazing  what was college guy’s problemit turns out the surface you’re projecting on usually a projection screen can be just as important as the projector itself  college guy was projecting directly onto the dorm room wall where textured paint bumps and scratches all act to reflect the light away from the eyes and cause the picture to look dim and washed out   light reflects randomly off of a textured wall  source httpevilrealmorg  projection screens are designed to reflect the light directly back to the viewer which keeps the image nice and bright  however there is a tradeoff the more directly the light is reflected back or the higher gain the maximum viewing angle is reduced  in contrast a screen with perfect diffusion would allow viewing from much wider angles but the overall brightness would be reduced a screen with perfect diffusion would look great from any angle but brighness would be lower from any specific pointsource wwwprojectorreviewscom a screen with high gain would look very bright when viewed from the center but the screen would not be viewable form other angles  source wwwprojectorreviewscom   modest gain screen vs high gain screen  source wwwprojectorreviewscom  projector “uniformity” refers to the brightness of the image across the entire screen  in other words are the corners of the image as bright as the center  while this is mainly driven by the quality of the projector itself projection screens can help to diffuse the light more evenly  some screens add an optical coating to increase the total light uniformity a projection setup with good uniformity would fill the entire screen evenly  source wwwmycockpitorg  finally projection screens play a large role in maintaining image contrast  since projectors do not actually produce the color black a projection screen is required to keep contrast high especially in an environment with ambient light  high contrast gray screens work well in this situation  the gray screen absorbs ambient light that a white screen would reflect back and in doing so the black level on the screen is maintained   gray screen left vs matte white screen right  source wwwprojectorreviewscom  the point is a great projected image is much more complicated than simply pointing a projector at a wall  as we continue to develop spud we are considering all of these aspects of the projectortoscreen setup to ensure the best viewing experience  you’ll always have a great picture wherever and whenever you want may   justin mintzer thank you maker faire may   justin mintzer you’ve probably met some exceptionally creative people in your life  remember that girl in your neighborhood that was always tinkering in her garage  or the classmate that would spend his days creating masterpieces of art on the cover of his textbook  or the engineer who is always trying to improve the latest tech devices  maybe you know someone that believes coming up with an idea is good and actually implementing that idea is better  from the parttime tinkerers to the fulltime creators these people are out there

their work and most importantly to learn from one another  maker faire is continuing to grow in popularity with events all over the worldwe have attended a few of these maker faire events and each time we’ve gotten valuable feedback and encouragement  so from your fellow makers thank you maker faire community for being so awesome it was a beautiful day in san mateo ca naturally when a bunch of makers come together there will be robots machines that can draw better than me  inconcieveable its not always about being high tech more scarier robots i too would make an adorable giant trex if i

movies with these durable headphones made for kids  a builtin volume limiter protects their ears and the included stickers and markers allow them to personalize to their hearts content  if you have

memory… certainly enough to keep them busy  plus it might be interesting to see your vacation through your kids’ eyes for a change   weboost drive gx cell phone booster – the biggest battery in the

that pops open to a inch tv screen  in the car  yes  in the hotel room  yep  out on the patio  of course  you can’t really go wrong when you have a inch screen wherever you need it  april   justin mintzer how to wear your technology everywhere april   justin mintzer last week i overheard someone saying that the collapsed spud looked like something batman could wear on his utility belt  that got me thinking about the quickly growing world of wearable technology and i soon found myself digging into the newest wearables out there  there’s no shortage of ideas the options range from ridiculous to potentially lifesaving  for those of you who simply must have your technology with you wherever you are check out the latest and greatest in wearables airjamz wearable air guitar  when you play the air guitar you can hear that perfect solo in your head but what about everyone else  now they can too with airjamz  this wristband connects to your mobile device via bluetooth enabling your rock star motions to be translated into real music instantly  “the technology inside is light years ahead of standard airguitars”  enough said  zepp multisport sensors  zepp’s new “smart coarch system” uses a sensor you attach to your golf glove baseball bat or tennis racket  the sensor records data about swing speeds and angles then transmits that back to their mobile app to analyze and generate coaching advice like highlighting areas that need the most work  if you want to improve that swing maybe this wearable is just what you need  neopenda wearable vital signs monitor for newborns  in developing countries around the world over  million newborns require additional care and monitoring due to complications at birth  the neopenda is a hat with a built in sensor array that continuously measures an infant’s heart rate respiratory rate blood oxygen saturation and temperature  in the critical first few days of life closely monitoring these vital signs can save a baby’s life and unfortunately many hospitals in resourceconstrained settings can’t monitor all of their newborn patients fast enough  the newpenda could help significantly reduce the nearly  million newborn deaths in the developing worldnike hyperadapt   well it’s about time  this was supposed to exist back in   nike has finally announced their first “power lacing” sneaker potentially making the timewasting activity of tying your shoes a thing of the past  tiffany beers the project’s technical lead explains how they will work “your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten  then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen you can adjust it until it’s perfect”  i believe this means flying cars are just around the corner apple watch  okay the apple watch may not be the newest wearable in the world but it felt too weird creating this list without mentioning it  while the jury still seems to be out on this type of wearable technology the potential is intriguing  the apple watch and smartwatches like it connects to your smartphone and allows you to display and reply to messages make calls download apps track your steps and do pretty much anything else your smartphone can do… but from your wrist  i believe it also tells time  the posting tail  this one is my favorite  we may soon live in a world where dogs can take pictures then upload those pictures to facebook  according to saatchi  saatchi they have created a device that your fourlegged friend can wear that includes a camera and some sort of tail wagging sensor  when your dog is happy the sensor detects the “happy tail wag” they specifically note that the device is capable of distinguishing a regular tail wag from a happy one and takes a picture tags it with a gps location and uploads it to facebook  i can’t wait to see what pictures my dog will take  i imagine there will be lots of suspicioussmelling grass pictures eskin ultraflexible organic photonic skin  lastly we have eskin a technology that is still being tested in the academic space but has some pretty significant potential  tokyo’s graduate school of engineering has created a protective film that is less than  mm thick yet strong enough to attach pled’s to create onskin displays  we may see this one day used as a pulse rate monitor or blood oxygen sensor… or maybe some programmable body art  april   justin mintzer rice university supports startups like arovia april   justin mintzer “it’s official i’m a student again” alex thought to himself as he walked into the classroom  he was starting the next chapter of his life as a rice mba student  he had enjoyed working as an engineer but he really wanted to understand things from the business perspective  and while it had been years since college he was excited to dive back into school  but it already felt different  everything was now digital and all students carried around a laptop or tablet everywhere they went  everyone was always on the go students worked in conference rooms groups met in coffee shops and classmates submitted their assignments from wherever they happened to be  as alex became one of them he realized that his inch ultrabook didn’t give him enough screen space for all of his research excel tasks and large editing jobs  he needed another screen  he needed to invent spud…“interesting” george thought to himself as he listened to alex pitch his idea  he knew alex was a business student but in alex’s defense he did have an engineering background  and the idea wasn’t halfbad  in fact it seemed surprisingly well thoughtout  george had come to rice university as a mechanical engineering student and he had always loved designing and building things  as alex continued george couldn’t help but start the design in his head  the screen had to be large and collapsible  it would have to be lightweight but sturdy  the mechanics had to be easy and fast  george knew that creating spud would be very challenging  he could feel himself beginning to smile   since we alex and george teamed up our vision of spud is quickly becoming a reality  rice university has been extremely supportive of our work and instrumental in our early successes entrepreneurship rice has helped us built up an amazing team and that gave us valuable connections in the startup community  we have participated in and won funding from multiple business plan competitions and we were awarded a k grant from the national science foundation  we were selected to exhibit at sxsw this year and we got to meet lots of our supporters in person  currently we are finalizing our industrial prototype which will be the consumerready product we will use to launch our upcoming crowdfunding campaign sign up here to be notified when it launches  and we’re very excited to be competing in the rice business plan competition starting on fridaythank you rice university and the houston startup community for all of your help and support april   justin mintzer how to get the most out of spud april   justin mintzer we’ve had lots of excited folks tell us how they would use spud often in ways we had never even considered  we love hearing new ideas and thought we

 the idea is to find interested people to help fund your business during the initial design and manufacturing phases and ideally boost that business to a point where it can sustain itself moving forward  campaign “backers” benefit by seeing a project that they believe in come to life and they often receive additional benefits such as early access to the product  however many people don’t realize how difficult and expensive it can be to launch and run a crowdfunding campaign tasks like website development professional video production social media management and online marketing all get added to the existing and often fulltime job of product design test and manufacturing as we are preparing for our own campaign for spud we wanted to give a shoutout to some interesting and promising crowdfunding campaigns that have not yet reached their funding goals… and time is almost up iblinds – by hab home intelligence llc –    – ends this diy device allows you to open and close

the best of luck to all of these crowdfunding teams march   justin mintzer how to netflix like a pro march   justin mintzer millions of people watch netflix at home  since spud was designed for

of your streams and bingesperfect your settings one person can use multiple profiles  keep your movie moods in order create multiple profiles for yourself – most people know that netflix allows you to create different profiles for your multiple account users which is nice for keeping personal ratings and preferences separated   but why not use multiple profiles as an individual  you can create

mintzer our ten favorite austin restaurants without the sxsw crowds march   justin mintzer austin tx has some of the best food in the world  as a houston based company only about ½ hours away from austin we’re very lucky to have an austinite on the team to give us tips on the best food in the city  this is especially helpful during sxsw where we have a trade show booth come check out our spontaneous popup display stand   since nearby food spots are sure to be extra crazy at this time of year we asked him to list his favorite food stops outside of downtown and hopefully away from the crowds  here’s his list just as he originally sent it to us texmexa tacodeli – my favorite taco place  they have a whole list of tacos to choose from each with a unique flavor and look  most importantly you must order the chips and queso… i’ve found no other molten cheese that can compare  one downside they’re only open for breakfast and lunch sadly they close at pm every dayb trudy’s – a texmex place known for their mexican martinis  one mexican martini is much larger than it sounds since the fancy martini glass comes with a separate shaker filled with “the rest” of your drink  if you’re as classy as me you can have them hold the glass and just put a straw in the shaker  keep in mind this is a serious drink and they cut you off at two  the food is also great try the stuffed avocado for a ridiculously rich and tasty meal though full disclosure i don’t think i’ve ever tried the food before getting halfway through my drink…c el arroyo – a texmex restaurant known not only for their food but also for their sign  it’s great for happy hour with a large variety of cheap frozen margaritas  since their th street location will probably be packed their second location is up north off of far west blvd is just as good without the sign unfortunatelybbqd salt lick bbq – one of austin’s most famous bbq joints  if you want some serious texas bbq and you don’t mind a  min drive south assuming no traffic then the salt lick is what you want  it’s one of those things you have to taste to understand  and as it should be it’s byob… bring your coolerse rudy’s bbq – for everyday bbq rudy’s is my favorite  you order meat by weight here and they give it to you on a large piece of paper  plates would only get in the way  the bbq sauce is amazing and the sides are just right burgersf hopdoddy burger bar – this is the “fancy” burger place with lots of different burgers on the menu along with daily specials that keep things interesting  it isn’t surprising to see a line forming out the door during nonsxsw times but things tend to move pretty quickly  it isn’t cheap expect to spend  for the burger alone and you’ll probably want to add fries along with a drink from their full bar to your order  keep in mind the burgers are giant and great for splittingg mighty fine burgers – simple menu delicious burgers  they focus on one thing and they do it right  i strongly recommend the milkshakes but only if you have enough willpower not to finish the whole thing before your burger is ready… its not easy to dosushih uchiko – now i’m not really a sushi guy but this place is amazing  i went with a small group and tried lot of different dishes  everything was great  that being said it’s a pretty expensive restaurant  if you want a great meal and are willing to pay for it uchiko won’t disappointthaii madam mam’s – my favorite thai place with great food and huge portions  i tend to be boring and stick to the pad thai i can’t help myself it’s delicious but i have ventured out a few times and have never been disappointed  i’ve only been to the guadalupe location which is probably still a bit too close to the sxsw crowds  i’m betting the north location is just as goodj kerbey lane cafe – the  cafe that serves breakfast anytime and other stuff too  they have consistently great food and they’ve managed to capture that “austin atmosphere” that everyone loves even at their strip mall location which is impressive  a great place to go any time of day or nightwe hope this list points you in the right direction  come see us at the arovia booth on the sxsw expo floor stand   we would love to compare notes on the best food spots in town march   justin mintzer how to win your march madness pool march   justin mintzer the madness will soon begin…people everywhere have started working on their march madness tournament brackets determined to finally win that office pool or earn bragging rights over their friends  last year some estimates suggested that march madness “activities” during work hours accounted for up to  billion worth of lost wages challenger  march madness report  surprisingly many companies out there actually view this as a positive event that boosts employee morale and encourages employee interaction or maybe they’re just afraid of an employee riot if they tried to stop it if you want to get in on the action but don’t know where to start you’re in luck  we’ve laid out the basics for you below including some essential online resources that will get you ready for the madnesswhat is march madness march madness is a team ncaa basketball tournament not counting the “first four” opening round which is not part of the traditional team bracket  all  teams are given a ranking or seed based on their performance during the regular season and this seed and bracket spot is announced on selection sunday  the format is singleelimination meaning after each round the number of teams remaining is cut in half from  to  round of  to  sweet sixteen to  elite eight to  final four and to  national championshipan office pool usually consists of each person submitting their own “bracket” showing their predictions of which teams will win and which will lose all the way through to the national championship game  the person who earns the most points for correct predictions wins  while this may sound simple enough  starting teams means there are  over  quintillion possible bracket outcomes  since all teams weren’t created equal a little research can go a long way…online resourcesodds odds shark the spread – vegas has some experience setting the lines for games so it never hurts to factor those into your decisionsstats ncaacom teamrankingscom kenpomcom statfoxcom – if you love digging into the data or if you have way too much time on your hands many websites have the team and player statistics from the regular season  this may help you decide some of those tougher matchupsanalysis espncom cbs sports – espn and cbs will have lots of analysis and predictions of game outcomes but keep in mind almost everyone with a bracket will see these same predictions  sometimes it helps to separate yourself from the crowdbracket printable bracket espn – because sometimes you want to use a pencil and paperhow to watchonce you have your bracket finalized all that’s left is to stream the games  here’s where the spontaneous popup display really comes in handy you can connect to your laptop tablet or smartphone and stream the games to a high resolution inch screen  for streaming options check outmarch madness

stream the games on cbssling tv – free day trial month afterespn gamecast – not a video but a playbyplay textgraphical feed of every game  it’s free so great for keeping track of other less interesting gamesgood luck and remember when in doubt always choose the team with the best mascot march   justin mintzer how to lose the wires and keep the high definition march   justin mintzer the hdmi cable has been accepted as the standard for wired hd content transmission but the race to find the wireless standard is just getting started  there’s no clear winner yet in the handful of incompatible standards out there today  we spent a lot of time researching the different wireless options to integrate into the spontaneous popup display  since we never found a great summary of all of the options we decided to create one also known as ultragig wirelesshd was designed and optimized for wireless display connectivity  the picture quality is great since no compression is used and there is virtually no latency but the high ghz frequency transmission requires direct line of sight  wirelesshd seems to be the frontrunner at this point whdi or wireless home digital interface is a wirelesshd competitor that seems to have a bit less support in the industry  it stands out as the wireless interface with a significantly longer range that does not need line of sight meaning it can go through walls  however there is some concern that the ghz range could interfere with wifi signals in that same range wigig or wireless gigabit is similar to wirelesshd in that it uses the same ghz range giving it high data rates but also requiring direct line of sight  it is part of the wifi family and as such it is not specifically targeted at the television space  however the high data rates and low latency would allow the transmission of uncompressed high definition content widi wireless display based on the miracast standard was created to allow you to mirror your phone or tablet’s display on your television  it is similar in performance to wifi solutions but widi uses a direct connection to the display device which keeps the latency lower  hd content is compressed using the h mpeg codec  there are a few wifi based solutions out there like the apple airplay or google cast  these devices use the existing wifi network to stream hd video h mpeg compressed to the display  some devices like chromecast can stream content directly from the internet  in other words that youtube video isn’t streamed from your phone to chromecast your phone tells chromecast which video it should go find and play standard frequency resolution max distance video compression connection type latency data rate wirelesshd  ghz p hz m line of sight uncompressed direct  ms  gbps whdi wireless home digital interface  ghz p hz m uncompressed direct  ms up to  gbps wigig wireless gigabit ad ghz ghz ghz p m line of sight uncompressed wireless access point  ms up to  gbps widi wireless display

cast bgnac ghz ghz p range of wireless network vp h mpeg wireless access point ms dependent on network conditions up to  mbps as the battle for wireless dominance continues were sure of one thing were very excited to see a wireless spud in actionfor more information check out geoffrey morrisons article on cnet which gives a great description of some of these options february   justin mintzer how to get rid of laptop aches and pains february   justin mintzer if you’re reading this from a laptop freeze  how is your body positioned  if you’re anything like the average laptop user chances are you’re leaning slightly forward with your head and neck forward and down aka “hunched” over your laptop screen  when typing you might strain your shoulders and awkwardly bend your wrists because of a desk that is too high or a lap that is too low  you already know your posture is bad and you probably forced yourself to sit perfectly straight after reading the last two sentences  you also know that you’ll probably be back to your hunched over position in the next few minutes  or is there something you can do about it  this week we decided to dive into the world of ergonomics and come up with some rules of thumb for healthy laptop use researchers have been studying the ergonomics of laptop use for years  bowman et al showed that “common laptop habits can have severe physiological effects ranging from eye strain poor posture upper extremity pain and other injuries resulting from overuse” moffet et al studied the causes of musculoskeletal pain related to laptop use and found multiple common positions that resulted in “high muscle load levels in the trapezius and deltoid muscles”  hamilton et al showed that laptop users have report musculoskeletal complaints at a higher rate compared to desktop users the bottom line more people are using laptops for longer periods of time and laptops were designed for portability not ergonomics  the poor body positioning associated with laptop designs when repeated often or over a long period of time can have significant physiological effects on the useryou can greatly improve your body position by focusing on two main areas  head and neck balance and  wrist and elbow position image source a very indepth whitepaper from the folks at ergotroncom  yeah they did the math  check it out here     head and neck balance when hunched forward your heavy head  lbs can cause significant strain on your neck and back  “for seated workers the optimal position of the head is centered over the midline of the body… if the head is held out of the neutral position the force exerted on the spine is compounded by a factor of ten for every inch off center”  we often end up in this hunched forward position when using a laptop because the viewing angle is not ideal  “current research and technical standards recommend that… the top of the screen should be no higher than eye level and the center of the screen should be about º to º below the level of the user’s eyes” comfortable portable computing the ergonomic equation    wrist and elbow position ecause the keyboard is attached to the screen laptop users often find themselves optimizing the screen position at the expense of proper elbow or wrist positioning  elbows should stay close to the body and be bent at approximately º  hands and wrists should not be bent or turned and should remain straight  “when you type keep your wrists straight with your hands a little higher than your wrists relax your shoulders when your arms are at your sides”  taking good care of your wrists and hands can help avoid long term issues like carpal tunnel syndrome source webmd image source atmacorg  follow the link for more tips on preventing arm painthe takeawaysuse an external monitor like spud which can easily be positioned anywhere due to its light weight  spud will help to ensure the top of your screen is at eye level which will keep your posture straight and your head and neck in balanceuse a wireless keyboard to give you additional flexibility when setting up your laptop workstation  separating the keyboard from the screen will help maintain proper arm and wrist form that will no longer be impacted by the position of your laptop  february   justin mintzer how to take your tailgating to the next level february   justin mintzer most people know the basics of

my hand  i’ll see you at the parking lot february   alexander wesley how to ditch your expensive cable bill february   alexander wesley many of you probably have heard of “cord cutting” the practice of cancelling your cable subscription and viewing all your content online whenever you want   the reason for doing so is clear the average cable bill is about  a month according to bgr  many people simply do not need thousands of tv channels and only watch a handful of preferred channels   the prospect of saving  a month is appealing to anyone but only recently have the services and hardware emerged to enable you to cord cut without sacrificing your access to content  as the upcoming release of spud will add a new portability dimension to cord cutting now is the time to brush up on the latest available servicesthe most prominent popular services to replace your favorite tv channels and watch your content whenever you want includenetflix  a month includes thousands of movies and tv

bloombergyoutubefreeif you purchased all of these services you would pay  a month but carefully review the offerings and you’ll probably see you don’t need all of the services i personally only use netflix and youtube regularly  a common content problem for cord cutters is accessing live sports content  however many networks now stream sports content including last week’s super bowl and the ncaa tournament  additionally if you have a friend or family member who still hasn’t cut their cord you can use their cable login information to access espn fox sports cbs sports often does not require login including the super bowl and ncaa tournament nbc sports also often free during sunday night football and abc sports  you can also use that same cable service login to access nonsports content on demand if you prefer to not purchase hulu  the hardware for replacing your cable box includes various dongles and boxes that connect to a tv via hdmi since many of us prefer not watch to watch content

world’s first smart luggage  never ask yourself “why doesn’t my suitcase text me when i lose it” again january   justin mintzer how much time can a inch screen save you january   justin mintzer many people have gotten used to large monitors at their office or at their home workstation  if you’re one of them like me you may get frustrated when you’re on the move and stuck with a single small laptop screen   constantly switching between different applications can get annoying and resizing multiple windows to fit on a inch screen never seems to work well though we always try  you may even delay working on some tasks until you are back at your workstation where large screens make the task feel a bit easier  your own experience tells you that using large screens makes you more efficient but are the efficiency gains really that significantyesin  researchers at the university of utah conducted a study designed to test the productivity impact of additional screen space through multiscreen configurations  using three types of ordinary office editing tasks in slide spreadsheet and text applications the researchers foundmultiscreens fared significantly better than single screen on time and number performance measures  respondents got on task quicker did the work faster and got more of the work done with fewer errors in multiscreen configurations than with a single screen  they were  percent quicker to task  percent faster on task generated  percent more production were  percent faster in production had  percent fewer errors and were  percent faster in errorless productionin a followon study released in  university of utah researchers this time looked at the impact of screen size  as you might expect they found that additional screen space improves overall productivity  the study revealed that large widescreen or dualmonitor configurations are recommended for use in any situation where multiple documents of information are an ordinary part of work said dr james a anderson phd the lead author of the study and a professor of communication at the university of utah  given a workforce with varying editing and spreadsheet skills the inch widescreen appears to be the most solid option overallit also noted thatmoving from single inch traditionalformat monitors to inch widescreen displays reduced the time it took to complete a task from  hours to  hours  over the course of a year that translates to a savings of up to  days in production or about  per employee based on a  annual salaryin other words you feel more productive on your inch screen workstation because you are  keep using those large monitors for all of those important editing and spreadsheet tasks and check out the arovia spud the only truly portable inch display to keep
