quarter two of fiscal year  ill assume that everyone on the line has had a chance to read our prepared remarks as well as the script we are trying to make the process simple and less time consuming for you all so i wont read it word for word this time nor repeat information within it instead im happy to answer any questions you may have regarding any of the information that was sent out to you and so we will take questions at this time questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question today comes from vincent caintic with stephens please go ahead vincent caintic hi good morning guys just a couple of questions first on the delinquencies and the chargeoffs so just kind of wanted to get your thoughts on when you expect the chargeoffs to normalize and improve and also if you can provide some additional color on whats driving the delinquencies higher and if you could maybe give some color on if thats going to normalize down as well unidentified company representative we dont know for sure when they will come back down to normal levels but we have seen in the trends that the increase in the annualized net chargeoffs and the increase in delinquencies has decreased right so we feel like were certainly passing the impact but we dont know for sure when they will normalize janet lewis matricciani we also put in place id add to that three things i would say that would help us reduce delinquencies and chargeoffs one is we now have pay by phone in all of our branches which is now an easy way for any customer to pay at any branch via a phone call using their debit card or any card as mastercard and visa card thats not a credit card and we also have our collection center now in home office that right now is focused on the south eastern division and looking at the customers most likely to be able to pay in this manner through the collection center but we do plan to expand that expect to and thirdly we generally have a higher quality customer at the moment weve noticed that our beacon scores are going up on average now we have more higher quality customers coming in and we believe all these three things will have a positive effect on delinquencies and chargeoffs vincent caintic and on the data you provided so you have some new product initiatives your portfolio the customer credit is getting better smaller dollar loans you sell some live checks if you could give us a sense of what are your expected yields margins and chargeoffs on that so maybe have the model how your portfolio looks like today versus some of these new products how your portfolio model look like a couple of quarters from now janet lewis yes we dont usually go through the metrics on our different strategic and marketing initiatives but in live checks we continue to see for example higher response rates compared to preapprovals which one would expect and some of it depends on the other activities at the time for example in south carolina we mailed on a taxfree weekend a backtoschool weekend and got a very high response rate we also for example in texas for live checks have mailed in a higher quality customer so there are actions that were taking including reducing our lending at lower beacon scores that are generally moving us into a higher quality customer we have no intention of moving away from the small dollar loans we want to do small dollar loans and continue across our portfolio but generally the fico scores have been going up unidentified company representative and also generally our small loans have a higher yield than larger ones so as you move up the loan size the yield typically does come down but the credit quality increases so as weve added more new customers in smaller loans you could expect the yields on those loans to be higher vincent caintic any sense of that growth in live checks and what the size is for that unidentified company representative so as of september  we had  million in live checks outstanding vincent caintic the last one just from me so you laid out a lot of operational initiatives and i appreciate thats the new collections effort the pay by phone and you have new marketing any sense for how thats going to affect the economics near term and then longer term how thats going to look like so in terms of expenses collections revenues and so forth and thats the last from me thanks janet lewis matricciani look well have a better idea at the end of growth season obviously a lot of things are rolling out now in terms of our new initiatives in terms of expenses and headcount for example we do expect that were able to continue to reduce headcount for the hours at work of course well need overtime as appropriate as we go into tax season and other areas but because we are no longer doing field calls that gives you some efficiencies in your offices its not why we stopped field calls but it does give you efficiencies on mileage expenses on overtime and so on operator next to john hecht with jefferies john hecht one more question on credit weve seen an increase in delinquencies and chargeoffs when you stopped doing field calls i think that was part of your expectations i mean do you think we should see things similarly stabilize once we annualize that change in operating procedures unidentified company representative sure so were already seeing that so when we look at the increase  and then you have that chargeoff quarteroverquarter it has been coming down and the delinquency has stabilized as far as the increase in those delinquencies to answer the point the positive thing is that while field calls may be an effective collection tool they werent very efficient so while we have seen an increase in net chargeoffs and in provisions to a large extent thats been offset by decreases in headcount and obviously were focusing on reducing those chargeoffs going forward so we can have the benefit of both john hecht you guys also referred to you guys had incrementally more new and recurring customers but was smaller average loan sizes i know you gave some color on that and then you also mentioned higher beacon scores or higher credit scores im wondering whats going on in the frontend in terms of either underwriting or advance rates or so forth needed to drive that change or number two what are you seeing in terms of customer behavior thats driving that change janet lewis matricciani i am not sure its the customer behavior thats different but what were definitely seeing is were originating more loans  higher beacon scores because were being conservative and careful in our lending policy so were saying that we have more new borrowers and former borrowers coming than we have had before in the same quarter and of course thats a very positive trend because the new borrowers and former borrowers become your customers over the longterm going forward part of your customer group and also what weve seen is that for the new borrowers and former borrowers weve been cautious in our lending so we may lend smaller balances but overall were getting growth weve also put a suggested floor in place for our lending in our branches we always allow folks to make this objective decision in a branch because we believe that having that relationship with a customer and that branch knowledge is a strength over a pure model we put in suggested floors to reduce lending at lower beacon scores and therefore lower chargeoffs same on our marketing we are tightening our marketing to be more focused on a higher beacon score if you like customer of course complexity of a marketing model has a whole series of additional factors and we see that both for former borrowers and new borrowers and even so we find customers the beacon scores which is a rough indication of what you can expect in chargeoffs or credit risk have all gone up this quarter compared to the same quarter of a year ago john hecht so if i take that maybe smaller advance rates higher credit scores i mean its indication that you guys in some ways are tightening at least youre tightening maybe the kind of the framework for which type of customers youre trying to focus on going forward if thats accurate then are you tightening because of stress youre seeing in your portfolio or tightening because of just general credit risk in a secular basis or just trying to plan for the future maybe with respect to regulatory changes and so forth janet lewis matricciani no really we are tightening alright because were doing lesser for riskier customers in lower segments but were doing it as a business decision based on the future growth and profitability and removing if you like the areas where we feel we cant successfully be profitable in the ways that we want to and increasing in the areas where we believe there is a strong profitable opportunity so we are very happy with the results were getting which is in line with our strategy the business strategy john hecht and last question you mentioned loansbyworldcom youre seeing good growth in originations in that channel just on that is it a  electronic origination or are those loans generally closed within a branch janet lewis matricciani let me explain clearly first of all we have our new website yes loansbyworldcom and the other urls that we own will now feed through that and we are very excited about this new website i encourage everyone to have a look it is up and running and then what was the second question unidentified company representative  of the loans are closed in the branches still so the customer can start their quotations online and they will receive a phone call from our branch manager or branch personnel but ultimately they fill up and close the loan in the branch janet lewis matricciani yes we value the customer relationship and are not trying to be a pure online lender in that kind of manner we like to close the loans in the branches for these customers that we originate online operator weve got bill armstrong with cl king  associates bill armstrong good morning everyone a couple of questions you shifted some marketing spend out of q and into q i was wondering if you could remind us of what type of marketing that was and do you think that that shift was effective janet lewis matricciani so we look at our response rates at different times of the year monthbymonth and timebytime to maximize our marketing budget which were not reducing were just spending more wisely our marketing is a mix of invitation to apply preapproval to live checks in printed form and then originations on the web as we just talked about and so we maximize that mix based on the time of year the response rate for that and really its better data analytics thats allowing us to bring in more new and former borrowers than we have on the same quarter of a year ago we have much more sophisticated modeling to help us understand whom to mail when to mail what product to mail and i should also add we have much stronger creative material bill armstrong now your originations though still were down  yearoveryear do you see this marketing and these other initiatives that youve been describing starting to maybe get that turned around and maybe starting to add some point where we should we start to see some increases again in origination volume unidentified company representative the large thing driving the decrease in origination volumes is refinancings so when you look at new and former customers which were attracting through the marketing channels that has increased  this quarter over last quarter janet lewis matricciani and we have put in place various initiatives to have better marketing for our customers to have balance available to refinance so we have put in some different strategies that we believe will be strongly in our customers interest bill armstrong right understood okay and second question  its actually two questions regarding the cfpb one any update on the nora letter process and then the second one the regulations that the cfpb is expected to hand down are widely expected to substantially reduce payday lending volume industrywide in looking at your installment loan product do you see opportunities as these restrictions on payday lending come into play do you see opportunities to capture some of that demand which obviously will still exist sort of to displace the payday loans going forward janet lewis matricciani okay ive written down your two questions as weve established i cant remember two at the same time otherwise so the first question on the way cfpb do we have an update and the answer and the only answer i can continue to give is we dont expect to have anything substantial to say until the end of the process and we dont know the timings of that and were not going to be speculating were not in the business of speculating so we dont feel its appropriate to say any more than that i understand your need to ask we always address this in the prepared remarks and we simply have nothing to say regarding the cfpb and the nora letter secondly regarding the regulations on the industry that you referred to this is not precisely your question but let me say that as it stands today we expect a minimal effect a nonsignificant effect from the current proposed regulations from the cfpb but obviously we cannot know what the final regulations will be and we continue to follow that i feel your question regarding payday which perhaps is a more general question code as we see the payday market shrinking do we believe there is opportunity for us and we actually do believe that and we believe and are working on the fact that if more potential customers understood the difference between a payday product and our product there are many attractive criterion attractive features of our products that somebody who no longer has access to a payday loan and meet the criteria for our underwriting can be interested in yes in terms of a fully amortizing installment loan operator next weâve got john rowan with janney please go ahead john rowan just one question for me can you remind us of maybe the historical schedule of when you would go back to your lenders and renegotiate your credit facility have there been any additional discussions with your lenders to loosen up the restrictive facility thats in place now and just what any type of contingencies might be in place  not contingencies but what has to happen for there to be some type of looser  i wont say looser but more accommodating revolving credit facility unidentified company representative yes we do that on an annual basis we wont revisit again until sort of march april may of next year obviously if we have some clarity from the cid we would likely go back to it at that point and renegotiate then but absent that it will be normal annual process in the spring john rowan when you go back and renegotiate following the nora letter and the cid we saw a very big increase in the origination cost i mean are we still looking in at that type of ballpark or lenders are a little bit more comfortable at this point and maybe you dont get indiscernible that can get  million origination fee maybe just give us an idea of what to expect on that front unidentified company representative that was two years ago right so besides that extension we didnt have that large origination fee and we expect that post cid that the rate would go back to what it was previously from a  floor to a  floor again we cant speak for them but thats what we believe we are having john rowan you dont think that there is any negotiating power even if there is no resolution that cid to get the restriction on share buybacks lifted unidentified company representative they have agreed to let us buy back small amount of shares in the next quarter nothing significant just  million to kind of offset the annual share based comp grant so there is some flexibility within the bank group that were seeing operator operator instructions and well go to a followup question from vincent caintic with stephens please go ahead vincent caintic just one more quick one on the allowance so just when i think about the credit reserves theyve declined yearoveryear but weve seen the chargeoffs increasing but i was wondering if you had a forwardlook on how youre thinking about the allowance and if that implies anything on what youre thinking about chargeoffs if the allowance that youre using right now is what we should be thinking about going forward unidentified company representative the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans has increased yearoveryear so while i know that the provision quarteroverquarter did decrease that was largely due to a  million provision that we took in the prior year quarter where we had a policy or  a consol policy to accrue up to the rolling month net chargeoffs so while it looks like the originations came down our allowances are still higher as a percentage of outstanding loans than it was last year operator operator instructions and there are no other questions so id like to turn it back to janet lewis matricciani for any additional or closing remarks janet lewis matricciani we appreciate everyones questions today we are glad to answer them were very excited about growing our company and we believe that building on our culture of data analytics collaboration and quality customer service with the technological improvements and bestinclass practices we are very busy putting in place throughout our company we will be able to grow and strengthen our company improve our results going forward so thank you very much for your time we appreciate it and have a great day operator

statements it makes at this time it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host sandy mclean ceo a alexander mclean iii thank you leo hopefully by now everyone has had a chance to review the press release and the narrative that was released at the same time this is my th consecutive quarterly earnings call i think i believe we had one after we went public in  for the first quarter but i really canât remember back that long but itâs also my last so iâd like to say iâve enjoyed most of them over this period of time but at this point unless anybody has any specific questions for me im going to turn it over to janet and johnny janet lewis matricciani thank you sandy and welcome everyone to what is my fifth earnings call and the first i intend to lead in terms of the qa section and then we will hear johnny calmes our cfo before we begin i thought it will be helpful to share some of the my observations in my past  months report and my experience in visiting many of our us states and spending a lot of time with the vpos and supervisors as one well as visiting as many branches as i can every time ive been to over half a double states already im visiting another three within the next two weeks and then the rest and i have also spend a week in mexico with our senior management team and our top performer and what i found is that our people are incredibly motivated and enthusiastic about the company the family culture thats been created at world is very special and there are same positive relationships between our employees and their customers and other members of the local community in which we have our branches our employees truly understand the value of the work they provide offering credit to folks who otherwise would have very limited choices and offering them credit when they need it which helps them with their lives and everywhere i go i also find that folks are full of ideas and wanting to improve our performance in every way even folks who has been with the company  or  years are excited about the change and using technology to deeper levels and that we are not fixed in our ways in fact many have been waiting and hoping for some of the changes we recently made like debit cards like the consumer focused website with the soft indiscernible there is tremendous appetite for change improvement using technology and it doesnt surprise me because i believe that this was the case when i came to world and i came because the company has a strong foundation and because there are so much opportunity for growth by taking advantage of new technology by using data analytics in a way weve never done before by improving marketing and making it more segmented to appeal to different customer segments appropriately and by taking actions digitally on the internet and in a mobile manner it is great to see this enthusiasm in the branches because serving our customers is really what its all about in fact i like to point out that in the last five years we served more than  million new unique customers and in addition over the last five years more than  former borrowers obtained a new loan from us which is a great statement of satisfaction the point is we served a lot of unique people without us dont get credit the former borrowers come back as they had a happy experience now regulation is our biggest issue as you all know even though we are heavily regulated in every state we now have the cid from the cfpb as you know we believe the cspb along with all state regulators recognize the important service we provide to folks who otherwise would have very limited access to credit just like our employee who are key parts of their local community recognize this too without us folks whos car breaks down or need an urgent housing repair or have some other sudden need for money would not have a good choice or they just need tiding over for a short period with their utility loads you cant get to work if your tires on your car burst and you need  to get new one and you dont have access to that  if you cant get to work you lose your job and so you end up in a very negative situation we are glad to help folks with credit we feel a huge need in the market made but in very short term extremely high rate loans for the month or two and on the other side traditional financing that customer with great credit can achieve were very pleased to fill this important gap and we have extraordinary testimonials from our customers that already showcase the value of our products and the demand for them and id also like to talk a bit and point our use of data analytics which has increased enormously and is very much enjoyed by our folks leading the field everywhere i go we discuss how that state is doing on multiple metrics and over multiple years including the current one how each districtâs doing what are the good the weak the erratic branches are and we discussed the reasons for fulfillment ph and how we can improve how can we do better is a happy and critical question at our company and it always will be and after every visit itâs amazing positive feedback i get on how much the dataâs helped the team focused on their key issues but really nothing like pausing and looking at trends over time on key metrics folks in the field are just too busy to look on a daytoday basis and they are looking at each and every branch separately working to get the best performance first of all and have many pent up great ideas on how we can improve and were taking action on them in fact at our world leaders event earlier this month where we celebrate our top performers i got all the vpos thats the vice president that run each state and the four regions in texas brought them in half a day early to take advantage of having them all in one place and we worked for five hours on operational issues and how to improve them and it was absolutely terrific furthermore we have just hired a vice president of operational excellence who will start august the rd and she will be tasked with things like focusing on improving branch performance efficiency best practices everywhere optimizing local marketing activities collection activities physical branch layout how we incentivize our folks to ensure its aligned with our vision in growth project management of our new initiatives implement successfully and on schedule and everything all about training assets and this will be a wonderful addition to us and also finally iâll say in my visit iâve seen this incredible close relationship we have with our customers who know our employees by name who have wonderful positive relationships with them and we are going to take advantage of our strength in this industry space weâre going to move towards one branch to leverage our reputation and strong customer relationships so every time we move a branch it becomes a well finance ph branch where itâs legally possible which is most areas and weâve already put stickers on all the doors in our branches that say weâve been established since  we are serving over  million customers and weâre very proud of that of a very exciting future ahead of us so i just wanted to give you some kind of overview about my experiences in the last  months and now we look forward to your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions weâll take our first question from bob ramsey of fbr capital markets martin terskin hello this is actually martin terskin for bob ramsey do you expect loan balances to contract through the rest of  janet lewis matricciani i think it is too early to say at this stage we have various initiatives in place that we believe will contribute to growth but i think it would be inappropriate for us to make some prediction on how weâre going to perform through the rest of the year martin terskin got it thank you very much and thenâ¦ a alexander mclean iii letâs talk about that in the us the loan growth is relatively flat a lot of the decrease had to do with the move in exchange rates between the us dollar and mexican pesos which obviously we have no control over martin terskin got it is it fair to add approximately  million back to expenses looking at the run rate in q and beyond a alexander mclean iii im sorry can you repeat the question martin terskin is it fair to add approximately  million back to expenses looking at the run rate in q and beyond a alexander mclean iii not necessarily so if you look at some of the things we reversed in the first quarter including the third tranche of the group b awards some of those had a forward impact so the third tranche we had been improving around for  ph a quarter for that tranche and weâre also recording on  quarter for sandyâs b sort of the second tranche of that group b formation plan martin terskin got it so would you expect the expenses to go back in to the  million range going forward then a alexander mclean iii im not sure whatâs ahead martin terskin got it and i guess finally before i jump back into the queue could you give me some color on how youâre accessing the mco ph collection and kind of just color around the conversation that you had with the buyers and maybe if you have other avenues for selling mcos if there is some problem with that relationship janet lewis matricciani yes as we stated and iâll repeat itâs early stages weâre having some conversations with the buyer itâs really too early to say much more than what we said already we said already that weâre in conversations with them indiscernible maybe effective i think itâs reasonable to make a general assumption that our charge off have value and there are folks who are interested in buying them and that makes us feel very good about our future cash flow from our chargeoff account martin terskin got it thank you very much for the color operator operator instructions weâll move next to john hecht of jefferies john hecht hey good morning first of all sandy itâs been great working with you and wish you the best of luck and then janet and john look forward to working with you guys so moving on to questions in terms of growth janet i wonder if you can give us an update on kind of the mobile strategy when you think youll be live with that and what the kind of activities are around the mobile and technology strategy and then at the branch level if you could tell us kind of what were the same store receivables trends and other endeavors you might take upon to increase the footsteps like at the branch level janet lewis matricciani certainly so taking the first ill take around mobile and technology and the rest of the indiscernible our fiscal ph activities first of all more than half of our customers are already signed up for testing and we believe that number will absolutely grow the testing we use for friendly payment reminder for marketing and our indiscernible time and so letting customers know when they have the ability to refinance the loans were very pleased with that of course every customer who opts in for the texting option we send text too we have debit cards in every branch and we started emailing as a new form of marketing we found that emailing gives a lift to direct mail its not expensive and we are probably do more on that front as well as increasing our advertising spend on the internet so we have more than on a typical day  apps and we believe we can grow that very significantly we are actually in the final review states of launching our completely redefined website we have a clean customer friendly site that can be easily viewed on all devices including mobile tablet and desktop and these changes will comply with the recent google requirement to have top of page placement and improve organic search if you do these activities and we are very focused on that and excited about it the website of course will still include our branch locator and will still allow prospects and borrowers to have that application online as well as were adding in house tracking of all device right on the website and it will also have our informational video in the loan section on how to apply for a loan we are on schedule to launch that in the next month or so how we are faring with that on the mobile and technology front you asked about the branches and what were doing locally and samestore receivables i donât have the numbers for samestore receivables right in front of me but locally we have a strong push to give branches autonomy to do what they think is right in the local areas branches are able to send refinancing mailing out to the local customers they know as they think appropriate they also have a sales and business development manual which goes through all relevant choices of local marketing activity to help them grow when we found and that will surprise you that the branches who do more in our local community are the ones that grow more so were focused on that area too john hecht great thanks very much for that and then can you tell us so whats going on in terms of mexico volumes or balances ex the currency impact a alexander mclean iii i can to a certain degree the volumes are down in the mexico as well if you assumed the exchange rate in mexico for gross warrants ph was the same as it was at june  that would have been up  million in us dollars john hecht you said  there a alexander mclean iii yeah thats right john hecht okay great thanks very much operator well take our next question from vincent caintic of macquarie your line is open vincent caintic hi good morning thanks very much guys i have a couple of questions first on the credit seems like delinquencies picked up a bit and i was just wondering broadly does the rate of loan growth that has any implications for how your credit behaves a alexander mclean iii im not sure what the second question vincent caintic just the  i guess with maybe your loan growth having moderated a bit i just wondered with your  does that have an impact for your charge just broadly like is there a relationship between how the amount that you originate relative to how you think about delinquencies and chargeoffs a alexander mclean iii no i dont think so vincent caintic okay got that and then just on liquidity we had a lot of things going on in the quarter i was just wondering if you can address that broadly are you satisfied with your liquidity are there more actions that you expect to take such as the postponement of the debt raise maybe reviving that and then how maybe a view in how your existing credit facility providers kind of in the current situation a alexander mclean iii sure so the most important thing to point out here is that we have more than enough capital to operate the business as usual the only thing that weâve really lost through the amendment is the ability to buy shares back and the bankâs view is with all of the uncertainty around the cid and the cfpb if they decide to see us deleverage at least with them until thereâs little more clarity so iâll say theyâre making sure and have made sure that we are putting capital to continue to operate this business if at some point in the future we felt like we can get appropriate pricing to buy shares back if we believe the bank will be opened and would consent to see that those funds to buy the shares back repurchase shares vincent caintic got it in terms of timing is there any thoughts on that plus if i understand correctly so this doesnât have an impact for maybe the loan growth side of the balance sheet a alexander mclean iii it doesnât so we believe we can grow as fast as we would like with our current facility and as far as timing it wouldnât make sense until we had some more clarity and the event i could provide that is more of a clear of where actual proposed rules from cfpb or the resolution of cid until one of those two things happens and we feel like it adds that clarity then we likely wouldnât do anything vincent caintic got that okay iâll get back in the queue thank you operator our next question comes from the site of henry coffey of sterne agee henry coffey thatâs sterne agee crt hi guys sandy itâs going to be sad not having you to talk to from now on but congratulations henry we will just have to sit around maybe we can go buy a cracker barrel some place or so okay but no congratulations and itâs been a  youâve been a good man for a long time looking at the overhead numbers in simple math if you add up all the onetime items i get  million is that correct a alexander mclean iii itâs close to that i had around  million henry coffey well itâs  million of cost and then a  million of   million of lower cost straight  plus  plus  minus  and minus  related to the deal what am i missing there did i skip a beat or something a alexander mclean iii weâll go at  if we look at your math henry coffey okay yeah add that back to expenses and you subtract  to kind of get to a run rate is that accurate a alexander mclean iii that should be about right yes henry coffey okay so weâre talking about a run rate of  million going forward on the existing business okay great and the second thing in terms of where you stand with your debt facility the increased borrowing costs are only a small portion of that was captured in the june quarter right a alexander mclean iii yes thatâs correct yes henry coffey and then thereâs a high credit issue every december so a year from now the high credit will be  is that how we should understand the facility a alexander mclean iii thatâs correct henry coffey and then the next year high credit will be  and thatâs what you would be planning the business around a alexander mclean iii thatâs correct henry coffey in other words itâs like based on not march balances but the real problem is going to be what occurs in december a alexander mclean iii thatâs right henry coffey and then janet this is sort for you but two or three questions on the big data front i think it would be fair to say that in todayâs world you can underwrite a small loan accurately with big data or some variation on credit scoring is it probable that the branches are going revolve in that direction or are you still going to kind of continue with the manual process janet lewis matricciani all right so let me address that a lot of our customers are in thin files right and what that means what that wording means is customers who donât have a credit score for a long enough time and thatâs a very difficult thing to model out there are very different specific situations and we believe that knowing our customers so well and knowing the situation theyre in in the branches and having that relationship is something that a model canât replicate could you use various different constrain techniques with new managers to help them on their way as theyre learning and so on and so forth that could be possible and i dont think that we want to miss the opportunity to understand the customer and our ability to make specific lending decisions based on that specific situation it doesnât necessarily have a numeric value attached henry coffey have you had any real dialogue with the cftb in the last  days janet lewis matricciani dialogues with them henry coffey and any  i mean their approach to  their approach to this whole process is  seems to be apolitical and if you read any of their press releases they have a propensity towards pejorative language or they obviously didnt learn their manners in high school or something so its very bombastic press releases et cetera et cetera i was wondering with the real dialogue is like with them as they start to review these issues with you janet lewis matricciani i canât say any more than they have requested information from us and in many of their public statement they have said how much they appreciate that a small loan customer a customer with difficult credit situation needs that type of credit and they do not want to take away the credit from that kind of customer which is our kind of customer so we feel that is a positive statement towards what our industry provides henry coffey the high point seems to be around ancillary products thereâs probably no proof of credit insurance or auto club or real product they seem to be more  they were are originally presented back in the ancient days as sort of intended to be yield enhancers is it possible or is there any more afoot to go into those states where you are heavily dependent on ancillary products to make the numbers work to get the rate change to a real rate like in texas you charge a series of season rates that are just based on the cost to loan that work very well for you but cant do that in the state of georgia is there any movement afoot to correct that janet lewis matricciani thats not a focus as far as we know so i think well continue to run up at least in the manner that we feel is most appropriate and provides value for our customers henry coffey no iâm just saying that if you  if the cfpb objects to the ancillary products has anyone at the state level begun the thought process of saying whats also their equation so that will charge  and the state of georgia will allow customers will allow lenders to charge the actual rate required and will simplify the borrowing equation for the customer janet lewis matricciani this kind of thing has been discussed in various states but so far nothing has actually been done or taken place on this topic henry coffey an amazing foot like what we saw in texas where you are able to dramatically increase rates janet lewis matricciani as far as we know we dont know anything about increasing rates in other states henry coffey great thank you and congratulations on taking over the ring janet lewis matricciani thank you very much operator operator instructions well move next to john rollin ph unidentified analyst good morning iâll echo everyone elses appreciation for sandy on the call over these many years itâs been great working with you as far as just say kind of get back to their run rate and ga obviously there is for  net it out for  million in add backs but i also wanted to kind of point out and get your take on seasonally how those ramp because it doesnât seem like you should kind of straight line the ga because there are if im not mistaken some programs that hit in june and december that you have to accrue for it would be annual employee appreciation program so do you guys still run those and are those still a contributor in the june and the december quarter a alexander mclean iii we still do have an appreciation day what it is called world leaders day now that happened in july of this year itâs not a significant amount of cost and it is slightly less than it would have been in the past i would say in the december quarter youâll have additional marketing expense as we ramp up our campaigns going into the christmas season unidentified analyst okay and then just to be clear on the  million of expenses that you flag for the debt expense i just want to make sure that was a onetime item thats not the amortization of the origination expense i assume thats all coming through  is going to be accretive to the amortization  to the interest expense line correct a alexander mclean iii thats correct  is accounting fees and legal fees and rating agency fees that we will incur as a part of bond ph offering unidentified analyst okay and then just kind of the timing trying to hit on someone elses question the timing of deleveraging right did i hear you right to say that your view  as basically the ceiling for the december quarter meaning that  is that contractually that you have to beâ¦ a alexander mclean iii no iâd say for this indiscernible over to next december so this december the ceiling is  unidentified analyst okay so you can obviously go over  million in the december quarter and then use the seasonal pay downs to reduce your facility to  million at the end of march correct a alexander mclean iii absolutely yes yes that would have been clear ph yes so in december  this ceiling is  million and then it will indiscernible in december of  unidentified analyst okay and in conjunction with that question john i just want to know what funding options do you think you have available to you and how close do you want to apply to that frame right i mean if you look  obviously i think youre funding your cash flow to fund the business but there are step downs and its heavily dependent on tax refund season and the timing of it ultimately congress delays tax refunds for whatever reason it might be i just want to know your comfort level with flying above that step down at the end of march i mean the december quarter and just relying on the typical seasonal pay down that would come and what options do you think you have as a lateral move should there be something that changes outside of your control john l calmes jr right weve obviously done projections for the next three years to make sure we thought we have enough availability under that facility and weve also built in a lot of cushions above this new operating  the new operations of the business including growth so within that well id say we have enough capital to run the business that includes any kind of unknown event that may happen whether be it a fine of some sort or anything else within reason right so based on the projections i still feel we probably have about  million to  million of cushion above our projected growth unidentified analyst okay and then just last question youve touched on it obviously does cfpb likes to find some type of finer bull ph sense if something were to come down is it by default a consent order and how do your lenders view the consent order visÃ vis level one or level two event under your covenants john l calmes jr it would certainly be at the level one event which would require us to notify the banks a key part of the level two is that has to have an impact of the material adverse change our business so it would depend on the consent order and what it does to our business unidentified analyst okay but itâs a consent order by definition its not like its a conjunction or stay which were vested in the debt covenants that would be below those types of notifications john l calmes jr we believe all of those would be at level one territory and which would have required notification if those things also call as material average change in our business it will be a level two regulatory event which all that really does is it gives the banks group a voice before for whatever reason we had to really change our business it gives in the voice to on the path four versus having to wait until we broke the covenant or deposit on a payment so thats all thats doing unidentified analyst okay and just what are the funding options are you looking for  i mean are you waiting for the clarity on the cid or in order to tap the debt markets are you looking at any other alternative vehicles when and if youll need capital john l calmes jr right so what gives more clarity there is a possibility we will go back to the high yield market as well as keeping the bank facility thereâs also the option about the private market which typically carries higher rates with it so we have options out there that in the short term in the next couple of months we donât anticipate doing anything at the moment but that can always change unidentified analyst okay fair enough thanks for answering my questions operator operator instructions weâll move next to j r basale ph of stephens unidentified analyst yeah good morning and thanks for taking my questions janet i was interested your us tour of the stores im wondering if you could kind of point out maybe the most common issue you saw and noticed while you were on the road and kind of the complaints or recommendations by the regional directors as well as the store managers kind of what was the resounding issue that you saw out on the road janet lewis matricciani well to take your question i think a lot of folks have realized they can do more in a local community through our wonderful customer relationships regarding things like referrals and relationships with local businesses and i think thatâs going to become a very strong push to us just by looking at the branches the see more of action the results they get i can tell you that our folks are absolutely thrilled to have the debit card option to provide to customers and the part of our mission is to provide the best possible customer service and for customers who want to pay on the debit card offering that service makes the real difference but those are a couple of things that come up also also is really around increasing our visibility in our local communities in a variety of different ways and we are hoping like the techniques on how to do that and sharing what works in the branches but one of the things i was most excited about is that people who have been with the company even   years you might think were set in their ways and want to do things the same way they are huge proponents of bringing in new technology and making changes to help the business grow and that appeals the customers unidentified analyst great and switching gears and last one from me the yields appear to kind of sequentially drop and just wonder john maybe if you can talk around what was kind of the driver there and then how you are thinking about yields moving for the remainder of the year john l calmes jr sure so the yields will be driven by towards  the volume and the size of the loan portfolio but also when you compare yearoveryear and you look at the average earning assets itâs down around  compared to the prior year as you know once the loan goes about  day contracting â to in the us and traditional portfolio in mexico we stop accruing interest on those so because weâre gearing a higher level of this the  day past due accounts that had an impact on the average earning assets unidentified analyst great well guys thanks for taking my questions operator operator instructions weâll move next to randy hecht of indiscernible unidentified analyst hi can you hear me john john l calmes jr good morning randy unidentified analyst sorry can you hear me now janet lewis matricciani we can hear you unidentified analyst okay sorry about that so the question of liquidity in the cushion it says right in your annual report that fiscal year â for the last  months you generated  million of free cash flow now some of that could be considered onetime because i think in that number you sold the chargeoff loans i think you took in  million or something like that so letâs call it a  million assuming youâre not growing your loan base your overall loan base for the next  months is there any reason why free cash flow would be any less  materially less than that number a alexander mclean iii under normal conditions we would expect the same levels of free cash flow unidentified analyst right so this idea that you may have an issue with your liquidity can at your march of â your line of credit  million your debt right now is  million you did  million of free cash flow you have a very large cushion a alexander mclean iii we believe so unidentified analyst okay all right just wanted to clarify that thank you operator we have a follow up question from bob ramsey of fbr capital markets your line is open martin terskin hello just one  two quick followups do you have any thoughts on the military lending accrualsâ¦ janet lewis matricciani on truth the military lending act has very little effect on our business because thats the timing portion of our customers are part of the military as determined by the military act so we think that has very limited effect now as the database comes out that was  one of the parts of this is there will be a database on which youll have to check every single customer obviously we still have to hope that the database is quite expedient and works perfectly as well every single other company in this industry but for the actual military loans that we make it as an insignificant percentage of what we do martin terskin thanks for the color and lastly janet whats your outlook for world in next three years and would you plan to do differently at the helm janet lewis matricciani i think a lot of it is building on our strong foundation that bringing more end usersâ data and more end use of new technology i think there is a lot more we can do on the internet and digitally some companies have a much higher percentage of applications coming through in that method than we are at the low end and thats not surprising because we really have only been doing this hardly even a year and i think also you can look to us we will be using data to really hone down on where we have branches that arenât performing as well as they can and specific ideas for where the issues are and how they can do that so i think this would allow us to significantly improve performance in our existing branches as well as to have better means of locating new de novos where we grow as state regulations change and other stages that come attractive you can expect to see us enter new states this is something we monitor regularly it will be good to expand as our products allow and i think you will see us get a lot more into look at the profitability of different loan segments to allow us to improve our underwriting decisions and understands for each of the different segments of loans we provide from the very small to the larger size how we can grow them successful martin terskin thank you very much for all the color janet lewis matricciani welcome operator operator instructions well move next to the site of paulo rebelo ph of bmo capital markets unidentified analyst good morning im sorry if you already answered the question but i keep getting dropped out of the webcast but my question in relation to the sale of previously charge off loans i couldnât find in your release any specific comments on that other than you had some problem with the buyer but is it safe to assume that the  million in net income that you told us last quarter that youre going to have per month for the next  months is still in place did you have it this quarter and you expect to have it for the following  months john l calmes jr so let me clarify on the  million and then ill hand it over to janet so we didnât say it was  million in net income we said it was  million in gross sales per month just to clarify and ill let janet answer from here janet lewis matricciani yeah however i think you missed we said before this is recent conversations with the buyer and its really too early to say more than that were in conversations with them the board ph flows out maybe affected we dont know more at this moment so we canât really add much more color to that at the moment unidentified analyst but this quarter than you had  million in gross sales john l calmes jr it as  as i said in the release itâs  million in gross sales actually net sales but not net income unidentified analyst and how much was in gains then john l calmes jr it would be  of that unidentified analyst all right perfect great thank you operator well take our next question from clifford sausen ph of cas investment partners unidentified analyst hi guys sandy thank you very much for stewarding the business through all these years and i wish you all the best going forward and janet i guess one thing that you guys got put up earlier this year was your  was your new improved customer database and i was wondering if it might be possible for you to share some insights about customer profiles in terms of different customer behavior customer lifetime value also obviously questions like how many times the customer renews a loan over their life and so difficult to cheese out from the aggregate just as we have and now you guys have some better data you might be able to share some observations there janet lewis matricciani our use of our customer database doesnât really help on several of these different fronts and we track very effectively by customer including age and behavior a number of refinancing but we donât usually disclose this kind of information we use internally to help us improve our performance and thatâs what weâre doing unidentified analyst okay fair enough and new customer challenge werenât in the release this quarter is that something you guys can still share a alexander mclean iii yes so the new customer volumes on advices was down around  quarteroverquarter unidentified analyst and thatâs count thatâs number or dollars a alexander mclean iii those are number of customer thatâs correct janet lewis matricciani right which is likely one of our highest focuses to grow our new customers unidentified analyst sure although that seems to be an improvement in the yearoveryear performance versus the fourth quarter if im not mistaken a alexander mclean iii i donât have the fourth quarter in front of me but it maybe unidentified analyst okay and lastly iâll take one stab at this because i know you donât really  tempt to answer in a public forum obviously itâs difficult to dig out what the cfpb is thinking with regards to cid and you are limited in what you can share right based on the conversations you had with them or the information that they have requested do you have any sense as to their primary areas of focus or what sorts of what they may be asking of you at some point as their investigation wraps up or the timing or anything else that you might be able to share janet lewis matricciani no we really donât we donât know what their focus is all the questions in the very beginning were very general so itâs very hard for us to say based on our counsel cfpb guidelines that re  to two years so we could expect to hear back in the next six months but these are just guidelines we cannot know for sure what their focus is or when they intend to get back in touch with us so anything else we said on this topic would just be guessing as much as anyone reading news about cftb is guessing unidentified analyst great thank you guys very much operator we have a followup question from john rolling ph your line is open unidentified analyst yeah thanks actually i have two quick questions i was under the impression that the forward flow of the debt buyer was somewhat of a contract and not necessarily subject to change can you just clarify if you actually have a contract or so or if itâs more outâ¦ john l calmes jr there is a contract in place unidentified analyst so if they stop buying do they have to pay any type of termination penalty john l calmes jr again itâs too early to discuss that and speculate unidentified analyst okay and then just kind of  not the hard part but just to kind of understand again how seasonal expenses move into the second quarter obviously we talked about the employee appreciation program but also isnât there  can you give out restricted stock units to managers in the first quarter as well because thereâs always been a little bit of a seasonality and a drop off from the run rate in ga between the first and the second quarter i am trying to understand if thatâs still in place john l calmes jr the annual grants simply adds in the fiscal third quarter unidentified analyst okay john l calmes jr so yes im not very sure unidentified analyst okay thank you operator we have a follow up question from henry coffey of sterne agee crt henry coffey yeah good morning a couple of questions historically you had people buy your chargeoff receivables and to quote one of your former executives theyâve done it once they donât tend to do it twice we actually are very good at collecting chargeoff receivables and we work on accounts very very hard and i was surprised that you were able to bring a buyer in this time is there something different about the current arrangement thatâs different than the historical results or is just a repeat of what weâve seen in the past that you guys do a great job of collecting your own accounts and the residual value in the chargeoff receivables is good but not good enough to warrant an aggressive purchase program janet lewis matricciani we believe there is value in our charge off receivables i cant speak to the past because im not familiar with any previous contracts done in the history of the company and the details therein or not we believe there is absolutely value in the charge off accounts there is a whole industry that provides charge off receipt of those and its extremely complex with the use of technology and analytics and deep experience of people involved in that industry that there is value in the charged off receivables of companies in our industry space so the market is there and it happens they are certainly more interested in indiscernible loans now than that can parse but i think the use of data and the analytics in that industry space has changed well its not our expertise on how to manage charge off receivables or prepare ph it at the time itâs certainly in the expertise of many other companies henry coffey and then going back to some of johns earlier questions i think thereâs only one other public company in the autoinstallment small loan area that is only using bank debt so at this point and i know youre interested in diversifying in your funding sources so regardless of the outcome with the banks regardless of the outcome of the cfpb what are the viable options that youll be looking at to move away from bankbased financing i know none of the pawn shops use it none of the small  none of the public installment lenders use it its almost like not  you experience not a great source of permitted capital what on the todo list when it comes to generating new sources of funding and where do you have a capital issue or not and i dont think you do i think anybody with hand calculator knows you can pay off this debt and continue to grow the business but having said that what are the options that you would be exploring john l calmes jr sure obviously one option is the high yield market the one indiscernible market and there is also a private market which typically carries a higher interest rate with that but it is an option and then of course there is the securitization and i think we were a little way out from that but it maybe something that we can explore in the future henry coffey great thank you operator our next question followup comes from vincent caintic with macquarie vincent caintic hi thanks just two more from me so one on the commentary on the buyer of the charge off loans i understand you cant talk in too much detail but i guess im just kind of surprised that the early performance hasnt matched the projections when its only been less than six months if thereâs any color on what that might be that would be helpful and then just on the text about  could potentially impact the amounts received does that imply the gains from last quarter is also under question or is that all set janet lewis matricciani as we pointed out in fact its been a very short period of time in fact itâs been about three months its very early stages and weve only just started having conversations with the buyer so weve ready cant say more than these are early conversations but there may be an impact on forward slow but well be able to give more information when we have further conversations with the buyer vincent caintic got it and then for the prior flow for the last quarters is that also potentially impacted john l calmes jr we dont expect to have any impact on the prior sales vincent caintic okay got it and then on the operational issues i think that was very helpful to talk about your room for improvement and i was just wondering where janet you see yourself or you see the company now and where you see the upside in terms of the improvement and if iâm correct in saying credit specifically any action items you plan to do there thank you janet lewis matricciani yes on the operational issues there is a lot that we can do to get more efficient and more effective even things like us precisely looking at overtime hours and branch opening and closing hours and the aligning them better with our busiest times so that we use less overtime for example and on collections looking at what we collect back for example from field schools ph versus the cost of during field schools and mileage reimbursement so were looking at all kinds of things at that level of detail that have not been looked at before to make sure that our activities are aligned with profit maximization at the same time of serving the customer vincent caintic guys and anything on the credit specifically janet lewis matricciani well our underwriting practice has serves us well since  based on knowing the customer and the stability ability and willingness to pay can we hope in areas for example where there is a new manager who has less experience yes i think we can help providing some guideline to clear that to help them as they get comfortable making the right levels of risk not too much not too little but the right levels but certainly looking at things they can do in that kind of situation but branches have been around for long time the managers know their local community and they know the folks there and they know customer behavior vincent caintic okay got it thanks very much operator we have a follow up from clifford sausen ph of cas investment partners unidentified analyst hi on two topics first on the charge off receivable sales can you help us think about the magnitude i suppose of the ongoing  million of annual sales thats at risk is this that the buyer is saying look we might have built the  there might be  or is the buyer saying this may not be  but it may be zero if you can just give me a sense of kind of what they think and not so much with regards to  month contract window but with regards to the value of the receivable the charge offs receivables on a longer term basis john l calmes jr again it is too early weve done all this for days so it is too early to speculate unidentified analyst got it and then secondly i think there have been some experiments with branch manager incentives and the impact of those experiments on volume growth and i guess i was wondering if you might share with us some of your thoughts there on and the impact that that has had where itâs been rolled out and the potential of that kind of business janet lewis matricciani so the biggest change in incentives is that we now allow branch managers to keep accounts in the branch at  plus days without having that effect their performance metrics so as before the branch manager might have desire to charge off an account at  plus days that they think they can collect before  days have passed because it affected their metrics now they can work those accounts for longer and so to your questions earlier as an example thatâs something we can do also with the customer database we look at  for these  plus bucket are we rehabilitating bringing back into the court if you like more of these  plus accounts and the answer is we are for these  plus accounts now and are now these are showing up that the rehab rate meaning the number of accounts that are making at least one payment from this pool of  plus late has doubled now its not a huge number obviously because as you can see the different buckets  you have fewer accounts youre going to rehab as time passes but nevertheless the account is making one payment or more is doubled as compared to where it was a year ago so were pleased about that unidentified analyst thats wonderful but actually my question was had more to do with volume growth are there new account acquisitions encouraging maybe managers whove become somewhat comfortable to work harder to find more new customers things of that nature janet lewis matricciani yes i think we have the right incentives there because what we have done with our branch manager is that part of their incentives are based on account growth and that is account growth based on the month before not the year before so if you are branch manager who happens to be quite a bit lower than the year before youre still incentivized if you can grow your number of accounts by one or two accounts and implement growth in the next month and youre rewarded rather than looking at a year ago so not feeling you have with your  accounts down from the year as you have to add the whole  you only have to add it based on your number of accounts in the previous month and we believe that is a positive because you want incentives that can be achieved every month unidentified analyst thank you operator and we have a follow up from henry coffey of sterne agee crt henry coffey yeah i apologize i didnât ask this earlier what percentage of your accounts are actually with the military the number is small but what is the percentage john l calmes jr it is less than  henry coffey thank you janet lewis matricciani very small number operator and there are no further questions at this time janet lewis matricciani thank you very much for participating in our earnings call and wish everyone a great day operator thank you for your participation this concludes
