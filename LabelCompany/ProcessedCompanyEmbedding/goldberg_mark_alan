latinao history medical history and the history of race and ethnicity in the us back to top research interests professor goldberg’s research examines the role of health and healing in imperial expansion nation building and race formation in the eighteenth and nineteenthcentury texas borderlands health concerns drove spanish mexican and anglo colonization in texas mindful of the health of the environment colonists also grew attentive to the health of texas inhabitants they constantly articulated what behaviors fostered healthy and successful settlement and what behaviors threatened human bodies in the process spaniards mexicans and anglos defined nonwhites’ everyday practices as medical threats to society science and medicine were central to spanish imperialism mexican nationstate formation and us expansion in texas despite the perception of indigenous and after  mexican residents as unhealthy colonist physicians appropriated native and mexican medical knowledge to treat settlers and soldiers along with colonists’ definitions of what constituted healthy and unhealthy behaviors healing became another site of racial differentiation doctors introduced new therapies into the profession by stripping them of their indianness or mexicanness and giving them new “scientific” identities back to top selected publications articles “curing the nation with cacti  native
