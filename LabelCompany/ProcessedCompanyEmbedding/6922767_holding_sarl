from negative  at the same time we are affirming all our ratings on the company including our b longterm corporate credit rating  we base the outlook change on our expectations that the companys credit metrics will continue to improve and leverage will be about x by fiscal yearend  this expectation in turn is based on our belief that the company will generate higher ebitda following reentry into the nigerian market and growth in norway brazil and australia rating action on sept   standard  poors ratings services revised its outlook on luxembourgbased  holding sarl and its related entities collectively chc helicopter to stable from negative at the same time standard  poors affirmed all its ratings on the company including its b longterm corporate credit rating we base the outlook change on our expectation that the companys credit metrics will continue to improve and leverage will be about x by fiscal yearend  this expectation in turn is based on our belief that chc helicopter will generate higher ebitda following reentry into the nigerian market and growth in norway brazil and australia rationale the ratings on chc helicopter reflect what standard  poors considers to be a highly leveraged financial risk profile and fair business risk profile we base these profiles on our view of the companys high leverage ratio the fact that its private equity ownership limits the rating to the b category and its participation in a capitalintensive industry somewhat mitigating these weaknesses in our opinion are the companys strong position as the worlds largest provider of commercial helicopter services favorable mediumtolongterm demand outlook from the offshore oil and gas production industry about threequarters of revenue and relatively moderate levels of competition in the markets where it provides services chc helicopter which operates  aircraft  of which it owns in more than  countries is one of the two largest global helicopter service providers it offers personal and light cargo transportation services primarily for oil and gas producers and exploration companies as well as search and rescue activities and emergency medical services through its helicopter services segment in addition the companys helione division provides helicopter support services that range from the complete outsourcing of all maintenance activities for helicopter operators to maintenance repair and overhaul services mro to integrated logistics support helicopter parts sales and distribution and other related services to its own flight operations and thirdparty operators the companys highly leveraged financial risk profile reflects our view of chc helicopters aggressive financial policy given the companys private equity ownership while standard  poors adjusted debt of us billion is in our view high it includes operating lease adjustments of us million and pension deficit adjustments of us million it reflects the capitalintensive nature of the industry furthermore the companys fair business risk profile allows it to carry higher leverage than would be warranted at the current rating standard  poors adjusted debttoebitda ratio has improved in the past  months to x from x on improved operations resulting from contract wins and reduced operating expenses we expect the companys leverage ratio to decline to about x in the next three years primarily on higher ebitda generation our forecasts are based on the following assumptions  the helicopter services business to increase  this year and  annually for fiscal years  and  this increase is driven by the companys reentry into the nigerian market and growth in existing business in norway and brazil  the mro business to increase about  annually on average  ebitda margins to improve to about  by fiscal  driven by new contracts fleet reduction and better asset use and  no debt reduction acquisitions or dividends in the forecasted period cash flow protection levels as measured by funds from operations ffo to debt are currently below  based on our forecasts we expect the ffotodebt ratio to improve to the low teens area in the next two years chc helicopters fair business risk profile reflects a company that operates in a bifurcated industry comprising the gulf of mexico and the rest of the world the company has made a strategic decision not to operate in the gulf of mexico which is a highly competitive market the rest of the world is considered oligopolistic with chc helicopter and bristow group inc bbnegative being major global operators in the majority of the markets in which the company operates chc helicopter has a distinct advantage given its global customer relationships safety process and newer aircraft other rating mitigants include a large portion of revenue supported by mediumtolongterm contracts about  of flying revenue comes from fixed monthly charges solid relationships with wellestablished customers and geographic diversity of revenue tempering factors in our view include chc helicopters participation in the cyclical oil and gas industry exposure to weather and seasonal fluctuations that might limit flying hours moderate recontracting risk inherent in the competitive bid process relatively high capital intensity for the helicopter fleets ongoing replacement maintenance and expansion continued access to capital markets for leasefinancing of aircraft at favorable rates and regulatory risks should government and environment regulations limit offshore development liquidity chc helicopters liquidity is adequate as per our criteria we project sources of funds exceeding uses by x in the next  months and sources exceeding uses even assuming a  decline in ebitda liquidity sources include us million of cash and cash

firstlien senior secured notes b the same as the corporate credit rating with a recovery rating of  indicating our expectation for average  recovery in default outlook the stable outlook reflects our expectation that chc helicopters credit metrics will continue to improve and leverage will be about x by fiscal yearend  this expectation in turn is based on our belief that the company will generate higher ebitda following reentry into the nigerian market and growth in norway brazil and australia we do not expect the company to pay down any debt in the near term we could lower the ratings if ebitda generation were to decline from our expectations leading to a leverage ratio of more than x for fiscal yearend  or if liquidity were to deteriorate likely owing to difficulty in refinancing aircraft or the companys inability to meet its lease covenants the companys ownership by private equity investors also constrains the ratings as per our criteria however an upgrade might be possible if ownership changes and financial policy were to lead to leverage ratio of below x on a sustained basis related criteria and research  methodology and assumptions liquidity descriptors for global
