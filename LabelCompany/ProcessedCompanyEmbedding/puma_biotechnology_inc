of several cancers including breast cancer and gastric cancer our initial focus is on the development of neratinib as an oral treatment for patients with herpositive breast cancer data were published in the journal of clinical oncology in march  from a phase ii trial of neratinib administered as a single agent to patients with her metastatic breast cancer the trial involved a total of  patients  of whom had received prior treatment with approved anticancer drug herceptin trastuzumab and  of whom had not received prior treatment with herceptin trastuzumab the results of the study showed that neratinib was reasonably well tolerated among both the pretreated patients and the patients who had not received prior treatment with trastuzumab the efficacy results from the trial showed that the objective response rate was  for patients who had received prior trastuzumab treatment and was  for patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment furthermore the median progression free survival was shown to be  weeks for the patients who had received prior trastuzumab and  weeks for the patients who had not received prior trastuzumab as show on the table below neratinib is currently being tested in a number of clinical trials as a neoadjuvant therapy for patients with her breast cancer and as a treatment for patients with metastatic her breast cancer a list of clinical trials for neratinib
