multimarket income fund currently yields a  income only distribution and is trading at a discount of  to its net asset value the fund is managed in house by nuveen asset management and has the flexibility to invest across various fixed income types a few days ago we identified a closed end fund that seems to make a good all in one diversified income play that fund was the nuveen diversified dividend  income fund nysejdd in the article jdd all in one income diversification  at a discount the fund was multi managed and was invested across foreign and domestic dividend paying stocks reits emerging markets sovereign bonds and senior floating rate securities while jdd may be a great fund it may be a little too aggressive for some for those investors we take a look at nuveen multimarket income fund nysejmm funds sales pitch the fund is targeted towards investors who are looking for a high level of current income but want a focus on investment grade credit and a lower level of risk management believes the fund can provide that through access to multiple areas of fixed income and their experienced management team the basics sponsor nuveen fund investments managers peter l agrimson john fruit chris neuhart aum  million in investment exposure and  million in net assets historical style us fixed income investment objectives the fund seeks high current income through investment in fixed income and mortgaged backed securities number of holdings  current yield  based on market price monthly distributions inception date  fees    interest expense  total  after  expense reimbursement set to expire  if not renewed discount to nav  the alpha the funds strategy is fairly straight forward in order to generate a higher current income stream the fund has both a flexible investment mandate and the ability to use leverage source nuveen cef website the portfolio ever get a little disappointed when the content is not exactly as what the package advertised yep that was me with this fund okay okay it is not bad just different here is your asset allocation and top  holdings can you figure it out source nuveen cef website source nuveen cef website can you see it yet okay this will tell you for sure source nuveen cef website the wrapper promised some sweet multi asset fixed income diversification like jdd and when you take the wrapper off you get a mortgage backed securities fund with a bit of corporate bonds yes it may be more healthy but i want my dang candy lol as per nuveen the funds average duration is  so even if the rates do go up by  or more the fund should hold up fairly well price  performance jmm is one of nuveens oldest funds and has plenty of performance history lets start by taking a look at the relationship between the price and the funds net asset value jmm is a fairly high quality fixed income fund and employs low to moderate leverage it is thus surprising that you have such a fairly high spread between the price and nav or the discount to nav this may be explained perhaps in part by the fact that jmm is a relatively small fund now with  million in investor capital for the most part over the last  years the fund has averaged about a  discount to nav and even traded at par or even with a slight premium to nav just  years ago the current discount of  seems to be a pretty nice deal on this fairly conservative income fund if we expand this chart to since inception you will see that such a discount to nav has come and gone in cycles switching to performance we can see that the fund has done quite well this year with a ytd total return of  over the  year time frame the fund has returned  and unlike many of the closed end funds that had a very rough h  and early  jmm has done fairly well on a  year time frame the fund has returned a solid  the fund also nearly doubles your investment over a  year time frame if we go back to the earliest date available the fund has brought investors a total return of  to put this performance into context we can take a look at how an investment in jmm stacks up with the sp  etf nysearcaspy and the ishares us bond aggregate etf nysearcaagg on a ytd and  year basis jmm has brought equity like returns even though it is for the most part a mortgage bond fund on a  year basis it is as expected jmm lags the sp  but outperforms the broad bond etf likely due the leverage and higher income where it gets interesting is looking at the  year number starting at shortly before the great financial crisis this plane vanilla mortgage backed bond fund has given investors nearly all of the returns of the sp  with far less drama if you believe that we may be near another peak in equities jmm deserves a look looking back to the earliest common date in late  the  year picture resumes and this cef splits the difference between the sp and the us bond index taking a look at where the performance is derived from we can see that over the last  years the performance of the nav and market price kept up with each other with the exception being the  and  year numbers where the search for yield has driven up the market price faster than the net asset value source nuveen cef website source nuveen cef website how does the fund do versus a proper category benchmark it certainly keeps up or exceeds source cef connect source cef connect overall a fairly well performing fund whos it for if jdd was the peanut butter jmm is the jelly some people like the peanut butter others like the jelly there is also a group of people for whom both go together this fund makes a good standalone core fixed income fund and has performed quite well over the long term as we have seen in the performance figures above if you are an investor looking for income and you are concerned with reducing volatility this closed end fund deserves at least a look if you are looking for a complete income solution jmm may make a good core fund partnered with some satellite type funds such as jdd coresatellite approach is it sexy no not really but it has performed well paid out a steady distribution while managing the volatility it will be on our list of funds to do a deeper dive on perhaps it
