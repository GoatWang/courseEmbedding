through private corporations and foundations most people know this money exists but just dont know where to apply how much they qualify for or even where to get an application incidentally the amount of money given away by these entities each year can vary as well as the time of the year that the money is given away so its important to check the date the application is due and when the money will be distributed many people think this money is given out at the beginning of the calendar year and this is not the rule some entities give out money several times a year or even all year long depending on who is eligible and who is not as you know our country has bailed out banks investment firms and other failing businesses in recent years you need to also know that they are not the only
