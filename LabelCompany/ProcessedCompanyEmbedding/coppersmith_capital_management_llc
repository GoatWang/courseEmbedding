coppersmith capital announces nomination of three highlyqualified independent candidates for the alere board of directors  business wire coppersmith capital announces nomination of three highlyqualified independent candidates for the alere board of directors delivers letter outlining alere’s underperformance convoluted business portfolio high leverage and failure to engage in constructive dialogue with coppersmith may    pm eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wirecoppersmith capital management llc “coppersmith capital” the fifthlargest stockholder of alere inc nyse alr “alere” along with the members of its section d group owning approximately  of the shares outstanding announced today that it formally nominated a slate of three highlyqualified and independent director nominees for election to the board of directors of alere at the upcoming  annual meeting of stockholders jerome lande managing partner of coppersmith capital said “over the last ten years alere’s management and board have spent nearly  billion on acquisitions the result is a company with a  billion market capitalization with declining margins a convoluted business portfolio and a staggering debt load stockholders deserve better than alere’s commitment to the status quo stockholders deserve directors that will proactively address the significant issues facing alere and work with a reconfigured board that is committed to maximizing stockholder value” coppersmith capital also today delivered a letter to alere’s chairman ceo  president ronald zwanziger the full text of which follows may   mr ronald zwanzigerchairman chief executive officer  presidentalere inc sawyer road suite waltham ma  dear mr zwanziger coppersmith capital management llc and the members of its section d group together “coppersmith” are the beneficial owners of an aggregate of  shares of alere inc “alere” or the “company” common stock representing  of the outstanding stock and making us we believe alere’s fifth largest stockholder we have made this significant investment in alere because of the attractiveness of the company’s diagnostics assets and what we consider to be its greatly underappreciated intrinsic value it was in this spirit that we have been trying since last november to engage you in a constructive dialogue regarding the numerous strategic performance and capital structure issues facing alere that we believe have caused its continued depressed valuation and poor longterm stock performance to say we are disappointed by the discussions which finally commenced in the last few weeks would be an understatement we severely disagree with alere’s commitment to the status quo and insistence that the company’s problems are more about investor perception than performance alere’s stock is worth today  less than it was two years ago  less than three years ago and  less than it was on january th  the day prior to the announcement of alere’s “betthebusiness” size move into health management via the acquisition of matria healthcare inc all returns through the end of april alere has taken roughly  billion in writedowns in the last three years equivalent to nearly twothirds of the company’s current market cap the company’s gross margin is down over  basis points in the last three fiscal years while its operating margin is down over  basis points according to alere’s reported nongaap adjusted measures we believe these statistics and many others that demonstrate the imperilment of stockholder value illustrate the clear and compelling need for change yet you have made it clear that alere is committed to remaining a heavilyleveraged inefficient and disparate organization with what we believe is a painful failed and continuously failing experiment in health management therefore we have nominated in accordance with the company’s organizational documents an alternative slate of independent and highlyqualified director nominees that we are confident will better serve the interests of alere and its stockholders we intend to solicit proxies for the election of our nominees to the board of directors of the company the “board” at the  annual meeting of stockholders the “ annual meeting” we are taking this step in large part because of the substantial and ongoing destruction of stockholder value and the company’s inability or unwillingness to acknowledge the troubled state in which alere finds itself as a result of its previous decisions indeed the steps the company has announced to address alere’s undervaluation and underperformance are an incoherent series of bandaids and halfmeasures none of which suggest the seriousness needed to restore alere’s credibility as a public company a telling example is the newlyannounced x leverage target for the end of  with net debt of nearly six times its ebitda presently – a figure that does not even include alere’s preferred stock – alere is vastly levered relative to its diagnostics peers and the healthcare industry generally it would be encouraging that the board finally acknowledged the tremendous problem with alere’s leverage if only it had more ambition than to spend three more years simply to arrive at a still grossly overlevered balance sheet based on wall street analyst estimates alere’s growth and cash flow alone should produce leverage below x by the end of  which begs the question how much new leverage is included in the board’s deleveraging plans another quagmire is alere’s retention of its failed health management business which in a masterful example of spin has been renamed “health information solutions” after five years  acquisitions over  billion spent and nearly  billion already written off one would think any rational assessment of the situation would acknowledge the massive stockholder wealth destruction and lead to a divestiture or shutdown of the subsidiary in order to save the company instead your solution is to seek to jointventure less than half of the failing health management division while embarking on a quixotic expansion into health information exchanges wherein alere is competing against larger bettercapitalized healthcare it companies who unlike alere actually have domain relevance alere investors can be forgiven for feeling that they have seen this tragic story unfold before we would not own our stock if such problems were not fixable indeed our analysis of the intrinsic value of alere’s assets if properly configured and managed suggests very significant upside potential to the current stock price however to thrive as a public company and achieve fair value alere must undergo a comprehensive strategic and operational rationalization a comprehensive strategic rationalization begins with the divestiture or shutdown of the health management division which we believe many investors and research analysts have already written down to zero a solution for the health management business would a improve the growth and margin profiles of alere b realize over  billion in tax assets c remove a dilutive lowmultiple component from alere’s valuation and d eliminate a massive perceived overhang that has tainted alere’s credibility in the market for far too long these benefits dramatically outweigh any theoretical pyrrhic victory you may hope to comb from the ashes of the health management division’s nearly  billion boondoggle this is particularly true of the potential tax benefit which would enable alere to shield otherwisetaxable gains from additional portfolio streamlining – therein allowing alere to refine its focus as well as efficiently generate sufficient proceeds to deleverage in a scope and within a timeframe that we believe investors might actually reward comprehensive operational rationalization is also required to reverse the worrisome trajectory of diminishing organic growth and margins in the core diagnostics business and to produce the integration synergies that have not been realized we believe this poor performance and operational missteps such as the recent fda debacle and its continuing impact are due in large part to a lack of operational attention and expertise from alere’s senior management we find it troubling that alere’s halfmeasure for dealing with operational decline has been to add a chief operating officer whose mandate you have yet to explain cogently and who reports to the ceo and board whose results he is tasked with untangling the appointment is particularly puzzling at a time when the ceo whose principal focus for the last decade has been acquisitions is running a company that has decided to no longer aggressively acquire despite the vast lowhanging fruit that we believe awaits a real operational rationalization we do not consider the current operational improvement outlook at alere promising a view supported by mr nawana’s curiously frontloaded restricted stock compensation restoring value at alere requires independent thinking and analytical rigor – traits that we fear the incumbent board may lack with its numerous insiders long tenures and lack of a lead independent director let alone an independent chairman for this reason coppersmith has nominated three independent highlyqualified directors for election to the board at alere’s upcoming  annual meeting our outside nominees are independent thinkers distinguished in the healthcare industry for their highlevel experience with issues such as leadership operational efficiency ma merger integration innovation and strategy at leading largecap medical products companies thus we were surprised that you summarily dismissed our highlyqualified director candidates during our meeting on april th  as unqualified to even be considered by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board in our view if you had given our nominees serious consideration you would have seen the undeniable value they can add to the board and a proxy contest could have been avoided our nominees are curt hartman – former interim ceo and cfo of stryker corporation as well as global president stryker instruments nyse syk during mr hartman’s ceo and cfo tenures he was directly responsible for leading syk through tremendous strategic and operational change including multiple acquisitions financings and leadership transitions all against the backdrop of the financial crisis and the dramatically changing healthcare landscape during this time stryker delivered a total stockholder return of more than  for the previous nine years mr hartman ran stryker’s instruments division generating market leading growth ted martin – former ceo of the barnes group nyse b former member of the boards of directors of leading largecap healthcare products companies cr bard nyse bcr and applied biosystems inc nyse abi acquired by invitrogenlife technologies corp nyse life for  billion during mr martin’s tenures the total stockholder returns of bard and applied biosystems were over  and  respectively during mr martin’s ceo tenure barnes generated a total stockholder return of over  jerome lande – managing partner of coppersmith capital management llc an investment firm he cofounded in  to focus on eventdriven investing in undervalued small and midcap companies undergoing or capable of operational andor structural valueenhancement previously mr lande was a partner with millbrook capital management inc an investment firm focused on private equity and eventdriven public equity investing the latter via its former affiliate mmi investments lp and a corporate development officer with key components inc a global diversified industrial manufacturing company acquired by actuant corporation nyse atu we firmly believe coppersmith’s director nominees are preeminently qualified and offer an objectively superior alternative to the incumbent board members who are up for reelection at the  annual meeting most importantly our candidates are proactive business leaders who know the difference between creating equity value and enterprise value and who will not need to be told that there are problems at alere in order to act we have no doubt that you are suddenly busy at work on various and impressive shows of progress just as we have no doubt stockholders know the difference between proactive and reactive leadership nonetheless we expect that alere will likely seek to replace its weakest directors unilaterally announce sweeping operational rationalization plans from your newlyempowered coo or forecast longterm growth targets that we believe are likely to once again go unmet as did those from your  investor day we believe such hollow gestures will help prove our point and hope you instead choose to work with us to create a new and improved board focused on making the necessary changes to enhance stockholder value meanwhile we look forward to discussing these and other critical issues facing alere with our fellow stockholders who we believe share our view that alere’s unique assets if managed and configured properly would generate significantly greater value for stockholders we continue to be open to and hopeful for a constructive dialogue with the board regarding maximizing value at alere please feel free to contact me regardssjerome lande cc           david teitel cfo jon russell

interesting thought it might be interesting for you the article is called hedge funds and is was published by octafinancecom at httpwwwoctafinancecomhedgefundscaptchasubmit hedge funds database in our free hedge funds database we have listed more than  hedge funds and institutional investors you can see the fund’s summary employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

replacement of directors up for election is a defense tactic that does not address strategic and structural deficiencies reiterates need for significant change to stop alere’s ongoing destruction of stockholder value coppersmith expresses disappointment at the board’s rejection of cooperation will seek the election of its three highly qualified and independent director nominees june    am eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wirecoppersmith capital management llc the fifthlargest stockholder of alere inc nyse alr “alere” along with the members of its section d group owning approximately  of the shares outstanding today sent a letter to alere in response to the recent filing of alere’s preliminary proxy statement and the disclosure that alere has nominated four new directors for election to its board of directors at alere’s upcoming annual meeting of stockholders on wednesday august   the full text of the letter follows june   mr ronald zwanziger chairman chief executive officer  president alere inc  sawyer road suite  waltham ma  dear ron as you are aware coppersmith capital management llc and the members of its section d group together “coppersmith” or “we” collectively represent one of the largest stockholdings of alere inc “alere” or the “company” with aggregate ownership of approximately  of the company’s outstanding shares on april   we submitted a notice of our intention to nominate three highly qualified individuals for election to the board of directors the “board” at the  annual meeting of stockholders the “annual meeting” we took this action because of what we believe to be substantial deficiencies in alere’s strategy structure and performance that are responsible for the significant and ongoing destruction of stockholder value at the company we have long considered the incumbent board to be largely ineffective at supervising management setting strategy and allocating capital resulting we believe in an unwieldy corporate structure massive writedowns poor operational and stock price performance and a crippling debt load alere cannot begin to address these problems without a reconstitution of its board including stockholder representation unfortunately the company’s replacement of all four incumbent directors up for election at the annual meeting with new director candidates appears to be a defensive reactionary tactic in the face of an election challenge rather than proactive change moreover it demonstrates to us your commitment to the unacceptable status quo and an attempt to avoid stockholder input and real change at alere quite frankly we are surprised and disappointed that rather than work constructively with us to reconstitute the board to ensure the best interests of all stockholders are represented you attempted an ultimatum promising to fight “tooth and nail” unless we voluntarily withdrew our nominations and supported your new director candidates prior to your filing this reinforces just how out of touch you are with the serious concerns of the vast number of alere stockholders with whom we have spoken in the last few weeks so we will state it plainly stockholders are demanding substantial changes to the company’s strategy and structure including comprehensive strategic and operational rationalization not simply a different cast of characters to oversee management’s floundering strategy structure and performance we believe a comprehensive rationalization of alere’s cost structure business portfolio and capital structure can generate dramatic stock price appreciation and improved performance with the following steps            exiting noncore businesses such as health information solutions “his” the consumer products joint venture with proctor  gamble and potentially the toxicology division as well these divestitures which we estimate can be done taxfree by first selling all of his to generate enormous tax loss are in addition to those presently targeted by management which you have previously told us total less than  million in annual sales    applying proceeds from these divestitures which we estimate could yield well above  billion to alere’s excessive debt balance this would lower alere’s leverage to roughly x or less more than doubling management’s target reduction in approximately onethird the time    rationalizing alere’s expense structure to produce  million to  million in annual cost savings with announced targets and milestones for accountability to stockholders we believe this target should be achievable simply by i returning sga margin to the historically consistent levels the company maintained prior to its expansion binge over the past two years in preparation for new platform sales that have yet to materialize and ii reducing corporate overhead at a minimum to reflect the aforementioned divestitures however we believe significant opportunity also exists in overdue integration of alere’s numerous acquisitions refinement and focus of alere’s disappointing rd efforts and elimination of its matrix management structure these actions are directly within the control of alere’s board and management team and we believe represent a tremendous opportunity even with our conservative estimates to improve the company’s growth and margin profiles simplify its convoluted structure reduce balance sheet risk and allow the company to invest both organically and inorganically in the core diagnostic franchises you have acknowledged most of these problems but your current strategy which includes principally a number of halfmeasures is unlikely in our view to achieve similar results rather than embrace these common sense strategic changes you have chosen to replace your  incumbent nominees in what we consider to be a tactical effort to defeat an election challenge while we fervently believe in adding fresh perspective to the board the timing and manner of your nominations calls into question the sincerity of your stated motivation for effecting such change after having added only two directors in the last ten years your proposed replacement of all four directors from the current class suggests this may simply be an attempt to placate frustrated stockholders and protect the status quo are stockholders to believe the board rationally concluded that the  class which includes the company’s newest director contained all of alere’s leastqualified board members notably the directors who are not up for election at the annual meeting have an average tenure of nearly  years and include two management insiders in our discussions you have repeatedly cited merger integration and large company ceo experience as criteria for additions to the board we question why such criteria did not appear to be as strategically important for the previous ten years when you added no such experience to the board despite over  acquisitions costing nearly  billion in that time why is it only now that the company appears to take the composition and qualifications of its board so seriously the company retained a director search consultant two months after coppersmith began voicing its concerns to management and seeking a meeting with you albeit unsuccessfully the nominating and corporate governance committee met once in all of  while your audit and compensation committees met nine and twelve times respectively in fact over the last ten years the nominating and governance committee reports meeting a grand total of  times for an average of  times a year with a maximum of three times in  and minimum of no times we believe in  perhaps this is why the company’s preliminary proxy statement reiterates its commitment to a unified chairman and ceo without even a lead independent director a governance structure that we believe to be vastly outoftouch with current standards of good corporate governance we are presently reviewing the qualifications of your nominees at first glance these director candidates appear to have senior level healthcare experience albeit principally in pharmaceuticals an area we specifically avoided for the selection of our nominees because of its significant differences from the diagnostics industry we note that more than one of these director candidates have had widely reported ethical andor business judgment lapses as ceo or chairman and we look forward to understanding whether the company took such issues into account when considering these candidates’ respective qualifications for service as a director most importantly we question whether the incumbent board’s preferred candidates are poised to objectively consider the strategic and structural changes on which we believe stockholders are focused we believe stockholder representation is required in the boardroom to ensure consideration of all strategies grounded in the realities of alere’s core competencies and riskadjusted maximization of value we reiterate our willingness to work with you to compose the best possible slate of candidates to represent the interests of all stockholders however we are also prepared to continue to move forward with a vigorous election contest in order to ensure that the best interests of all stockholders are represented on the board we are firm in our stance that meaningful changes to alere its board and its strategy are required at this time victory for alere is not quelling stockholder discontent – victory is improving alere’s valuation and share price by fixing its strategy and structure as you appear to have now acknowledged coppersmith’s criticisms of alere are valid and resonate with stockholders who we believe know the difference between proactive change focused on maximizing value and reactive measures designed to preserve the status quo we strongly believe that a streamlined focused and deleveraged alere will unlock significant value for stockholders we encourage you to join with us to focus on the strategic issues facing alere and embrace real change so significant value can finally be realized by alere’s stockholders sincerely s jerome lande cc     members of the board of directors of alere

presentation also sets forth in detail coppersmith capitals recommendations and timetable for the operational and strategic rationalization of alere including significant deleveraging which if successfully implemented coppersmith capital believes could generate dramatic value enhancement at alere jerome lande managing partner of coppersmith capital stated “over the years alere has blindly pushed forward with flawed strategies that have destroyed stockholder value in almost every respect now alere is asking stockholders to have faith and support its director nominees who have already stated their commitment to the status quo we believe real change on the board is necessary to bring about a robust independent evaluation of alternatives that can truly address aleres structural and financial issues coppersmith capital has put forward a comprehensive strategic plan that has the potential to reverse years of lackluster performance and mismanagement by generating far greater value in the nearterm and placing alere on the right track for creating enduring value for the longterm our nominees if elected are committed to working constructively with the other directors on the board to fully explore and evaluate all viable strategies to unlock stockholder value in our view the necessary catalyst is the election of directors who are truly independent of management therefore we
