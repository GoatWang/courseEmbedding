bloomberg news ben markus  colorado public radio jonathan chaplin  new street research llp us operator good day and welcome to the dish network corporation q  earnings conference call todays conference is being recorded at this time id like to turn the conference over to mr jason kiser please go ahead sir jason kiser  dish network corp thanks isaac well thanks for joining us this is jason kiser treasurer here at dish network joined today by charlie ergen our chairman and ceo tom cullen evp of corporate development roger lynch ceo of sling tv erik carlson president of dish network steve swain our cfo paul orban our controller and stan dodge our general counsel were going to open it up for qa but we do need to do our safe harbor disclosures so for that well turn it over to stan r stanton dodge  dish network corp thanks jason and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us we ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports we also do not allow audiotaping and ask that you respect that all statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forwardlooking statements which involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements for a list of those factors please refer to the front of our k all cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forwardlooking statements that we make wherever they appear you should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating and with that out of the way im going to turn it over to our cfo steve swain steven e swain  dish network corp thanks stan during the first quarter dish completed a transaction with echostar which was  echostar transferred to us certain assets and operations of the echostar technologies and echostar broadcasting businesses these businesses and their associated ip design develop and distribute settop boxes provide satellite uplinking services and develop streaming video technologies in addition we received investments in high frequency spectrum bonuses joint ventures such as nagrastar  certain real estate as well as the remaining  interest in sling tv in exchange we transferred to echostar our tracking stock representing an  economic interest in the hughes residential retail satellite broadband business we believe that this transaction will give dish more direct control over the product development of our paytv business which includes sling tv and it is projected to be modestly accretive to free cash flow due to the elimination of echostars profit margin as well as other efficiency initiatives because the transaction was between entities that are under common control accounting rules require us to recast our numbers as of the earliest period presented to include the impact of this transaction the impact of recasting the first quarter of  increased our equipment revenue by  million primarily due to international settop box sales to thirdparties our next income increased by  million primarily due to the margin on those international equipment sales and the elimination of the margin on the transferred products and services we previously purchased from echostar to build your financial models the  recasted income statements by quarter are presented in the mda section of our q regarding the balance sheet the transferred assets were recorded at net book value and the tracking stock was removed with the difference booked  capital also similar to the pl we adjusted ppe and inventory to remove the settop box and accessories margin which we had previously paid to echostar separately during the quarter we entered into an agreement which hughes which allows us to market and install the hughes broadband service hughes will make certain payments to us for each sale and installation please note subscribers acquired under this agreement will be hughes branded retail subscribers and therefore will not be included in our broadband subscriber count as a result our broadband subscriber count related to the hughes service will decline through customer attrition more broadly with only wholesale economics we believe this is the right time for us economically and for our paytv customers to pivot away from the wholesale model a model in which we pay acquisition costs but has significantly lower margins relative to our competitors for additional information please see our q that was filed this morning with that isaac we will now open up the call for first analyst qa and then media qa questionandanswer session operator perfect thank you and well take our first question from phil cusick with jpmorgan please go ahead philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc hi guys thanks two if i can charlie can you talk about your spectrum strategy going into the auction and how you ended up how does having the  megahertz spectrum change the value of the overall portfolio and then second for steve can you quantify for us the litigation impact from the first quarter that impacted ga thank you charles william ergen  dish network corp okay phil its charlie ill take the first part you never know what an auction is going to do so – but our strategy going in first we thought it would go for materially higher than it did but our strategy was to get one nationwide block of lowband spectrum because it does so many other things for our spectrum portfolio obviously  lowband propagates farther so in terms of penetration through walls and basements and things for your signal that was an important part of where we were trying to go second when you start looking at the internet of things and all the devices youre going be connecting in the future lowband is ideal for internet of things and that technology is going to change quite a bit with g and so theres a focus there we were pleasantly surprised that as the auction went on it became clear at the end of the – the first round or the second round that the price was not going up that it was going stay sub billion based on our projections and we felt that was probably in excess of  on the dollar in terms of real value for the spectrum so we were then able to not only get our nationwide spectrum but also then to stay in the bigger cities where we felt that the – particularly the internet of things would be beneficial so one of the things about auctions today is that the way the fcc does it its based on population so everything – every analyst and everything i always quote megahertz per pop but the last several auctions weve kind of looked at where we think things are going and we look at it on megahertz per thing not megahertz per pop or megahertz per microprocessor so whether itd be streetlights or heart monitors or automobiles or drones or whatever weve always looked at it as a megahertz per thing and when you do that obviously the more densely populated cities are quite a bit of a bargain discount if you believe our theory is right on that so that was the strategy we were pleasantly surprised pleased to be one of two companies that got nationwide blocks in the auction so steve steven e swain  dish network corp yes phil so unfortunately i cant quantify the litigation impact because these settlements were confidential i can say that even without the litigation impacts we would have been down yearoveryear on the ga line philip a cusick  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks steve steven e swain  dish network corp sure operator and well take our next question from walter piecyk with btig please go ahead walter piecyk  btig llc thanks charlie when the fcc made the decision on the designated entity bidding credits i think you had mentioned something like they obviously dont want us to be a competitor and maybe look to sell it and i think at the time you might have even talked about jason breaking up or looking at ways to have those assets in different buckets now that youve come away with this  megahertz band i mean its a more complete package has your view on that changed and should we rule out the possibility of you selling any of this stuff in pieces and this is more kind of a do something with it in its entirety or – and only if someones willing to pay for it in its entirety would you actually willing to sell it thanks charles william ergen  dish network corp i guess on the aws auction where we obviously participated with two designated entities i think at least we were – at least myself personally beyond depressed when the fcc ruled that they would disallow the discounts because i knew that we had followed the rules and the precedent that – and every other company had taken – all of our competitors taken advantage of the discounts in such a massive auction but obviously the number was quite big but on a relative basis it really wasnt just anything historical and its no different and then at the same time you have an auction of airways for broadcasters where the government gave them spectrum for free and they just walked away with  billion and not a word is said about the fact that broadcasters walked away with  billion of profits for something they got for free and we were buying spectrum so to me i dont believe it was fair and probably more disconcerting we were never allowed to come into the fcc and to the extent they had issues with it to work through those issues with the fcc so that the outcome was fair so obviously thats in litigation today thats in front of the courts the courts will decide whether the fcc followed within jurisdiction or whether they didnt and well live – who knows how long that will go on but look were going live with – you can always have honest disagreements we have an honest disagreement with the past administration on that one and well see what the courts come through having said that we arent giving up and we didnt give up and were not giving up and so were really pleased to strengthen our spectrum position and our strategic position and were not going to rule anything out and were not going to rule anything in walter piecyk  btig llc okay so even though its a more complete package now you dont rule out – in certain situations if someone wanted to buy a piece of the package that you would consider that as well charles william ergen  dish network corp well i mean i think that there are – look i think theres interesting parts in this auction i think its – i dont want to speak for att but its pretty clear that they didnt bid – i dont believe they placed a bid of any consequence after the first round and obviously with their – excuse me first stage and obviously with their selection in the firstnet sweepstakes that may be a lower priority to them so theres people perhaps that are in this auction that have other strategic interest and theres certainly things that could happen where you can see just like in football somebodys got a good tight end and somebody needs a defensive back and you can see things happening with any number of companies but you got to have a portfolio to play there walter piecyk  btig llc okay understood and i think rich wants to try and pin you down on a sling number standby rich greenfield  btig llc so and charlie last month comscore reported that sling subs if you include both domestic and international subscribers to at least one of your sling packages was something like  in july of  and moved all the way up to  million by the end of  curious if that type of dramatic acceleration in sling actually happened in the latter half of  and what drove it and just from a higher level i guess is it now conceivable that sling in some form domestic international that that represents upwards of  of overall dish video subscribers roger lynch  dish network corp hey rich its roger im going to field this one just on your second one we dont break out sling numbers separately so cant answer that certainly the second half of the year is a strong content time of year for us given all of the college and nfl football that occurs so seasonally we traditionally see stronger growth during the last four months of the year than we do in other periods of similar length throughout the year so we cant comment on specific numbers but that is a seasonally strong period for us rich greenfield  btig llc and the other services that have launched havent notably changed the trajectory of sling meaning competitors roger lynch  dish network corp the other services that have launched have all really been big bundle ott services so largely replicating traditional paytv packages and so when i look at our portfolio with sling orange which is at  the closest competitor really is about  higher price point plus we have this ability to pick and choose the genres you want to add on or our sling blue service which at  is quite attractive has a lot of content in it and obviously it doesnt have espn in it we know a lot of people like espn but there are people who dont want to pay for espn and so that gives us a cost advantage for that package compared to some of the other big bundles – for that service sorry compared to those other big bundles rich greenfield  btig llc thanks very much operator and well take our next question from john hodulik with ubs please go ahead john c hodulik  ubs securities llc great thanks charlie could you talk about your view on the sort of timing of the g rollout in the united states and sort of your view on how the technology is progressing and then secondly the big carriers seem to be focusing on the millimeter wave portion of the spectrum whereas youre focused more on the sort of low and mid band one do you think their focus on the very high frequencies is misplaced and where do you think the bulk of the heavy lifting on g will take place thanks charles william ergen  dish network corp yeah so i mean theres – and theres a lot of misconception about g but i think i want to now – if youve ever watched spinal tap i want to announce here first and foremost that were going turn the volume up to  and were going for – were going to build out g and were just going to go from g to g and obviously im being facetious that the g standard is not set yet so theres – youre not going to see true g until  and probably  in terms of g and the main things that – g is going to – it does a couple things but one is much lower latency which brings in things like autonomous vehicles health care and things into a network that maybe wont work ideally on existing networks it certainly brings in internet of things in a way that with millions of devices it can connect at one time that you really cant do on existing infrastructure today and of course obviously its more – its going to bring    times more capacity in certain areas and adds things like millimeter wave technology so it is a very transitional it is a very big paradigm shift and i think from a marketing people – marketing thing people are going to want – jump the gun and call things g but i dont think youre – as an american consumer youre going to get anything truly g standard just the total standard until at least  as far as millimeter wave technology i think its very interesting technology we have believed that for long time we participated in the auction the gig auction gosh its been like  years ago so we own four cities of gig technology but we also participated in mvdds auction with gig frequencies and that we have in most of the major cities in the united states and were part of the mvdds coalition that we believe that is the way for the government to add another  megahertz of spectrum that can be used for terrestrial use we use that for satellite today and weve worked with both the past and the current administrations to explain how that can help fund some of the spectrum gap out there so were hopeful that – we just missed getting on the rulemaking for spectrum frontiers last time well hope that the current administration will put that spectrum on public notice or in the rulemaking so that people can comment but thats certainly a place for the government to add another  megahertz of spectrum and again its technically centimeter wave technology it has better propagation technique – characteristics than gig does and you can imagine a lot of uses in the spectrum deficit how you could use that so i think were very well positioned if higher frequencies find a home we think were well positioned there john c hodulik  ubs securities llc okay thanks operator and well take our next question from amy yong with macquarie please go ahead amy yong  macquarie capital usa inc thanks two questions so first charlie just following up on the timing question can you talk about how some of the buildout requirements impact your decision on moving ahead with the spectrum buildout and whether or not you feel that with a potential consolidation on the carrier side namely tmobile and sprint if you feel like that leads you to any urgency to make a decision one way or the other and then steve can you talk about the arpu impact from sling tv and how we should think about the mix impact on total arpu thank you charles william ergen  dish network corp okay amy on the buildout one of the things i learned long ago is we focus on the things we can control so while theres going be a lot of noise and theres certainly going to be talk of consolidation and lots of rumors about this company and that company doing something together the one thing we can control is our buildout and we have committed to the fcc that we will build out a narrowband to iot network to perfect our license by march of  because of our spectrum position with the different bands we have now with  megahertz in the mix as well there are several different ways we could build that network out ideally wed like to build out  in the iot network but because of the month clearing schedule its possible that to meet that deadline in march of  that we cant necessarily use  in the way that wed like to do it because thats a great frequency for that so tom and his team are now meeting with the vendors and were also talking to the industry about what they want to see in an iot network and then well make some decisions later this year as to the frequencies that were going to build out and then start the planning process and then start to build probably – we got to get – we have to get equipment and then start to build late next year and complete it by march of  so thats the one thing we can control we feel like our balance sheet can support that build we believe that thats what we control in the meantime i think obviously theres – in terms of the industry i think there certainly will be a lot of discussions between people in the industry potentially people outside the industry certainly the potential of lighter regulatory in this administration could lead to some consolidation in ways that maybe werent contemplated in the previous administration and we have a tremendous set of assets at dish and its our job as management to put those assets to work in the most economic longterm model that makes sense for our shareholders and for our customers and thats what well do steven e swain  dish network corp yes amy for arpu youre right sling tv subscribers on average purchase the lowerprice programming compared to dbs so therefore as sling tv subscribers increase the weighted average paytv arpu will be lower for dbs we are seeing some subscribers shift to smaller less expense packaging commonly as you know known as cord shaving seeing that these customers want less robust packages we did add flex pack which is a skinny bundle option and while the flex pack adds pressure to arpu growth on the dbs side we believe the function of flex pack as a churnreducing save tactic increases margins in the instances where we had previously offered customers loyalty credits amy yong  macquarie capital usa inc got it thank you operator and well take our next question from tom eagan with telsey advisory group please go ahead thomas william eagan  telsey advisory group great thank you two questions first on the changing competitive dynamic in video what we saw in the quarter or last quarter was directv didnt add subs for the first time in about six quarters due perhaps to higher churn because their subscribers are going to cable bundled with broadband and i guess over the top so are you guys seeing anything incremental in terms of the competitive dynamic and are you seeing sling getting more subs from directv satellite and then i have a followup thanks charles william ergen  dish network corp yeah this is charlie i think your thesis is generally correct and i think weve been talking about that for at least five years that thats kind of what we foresaw that the bundle – theres a lot of dynamics but the bundle where programmers had a lot of leverage over the distribution path and youre forced to take not one or two channels or the top three rated channels from an event but you may take    channels of which  of them maybe you dont really want but you got to pass those costs onto consumers and the second dynamic is retransmission consent has gone up thousands of percent to the point where the cost of your local networks now exceed for the most part almost every channel but espn and that dynamic is such that – and in all these cases the ratings of the particular networks for the most part have gone down and in the broadcasters case theyve gone down significantly so thats a dynamic that pushes people away from paytv all together and for those who stay in paytv theyre going to go down to lowercost alternatives less advertising more binge viewing and the kind of things that have led to the rise of things like netflix so thats the dynamic thats out there so one of the things that weve done is in recognizing those trends obviously we have pivoted the company to a connectivity company and have tried to invest in those things that we think have longterm returns and invest less in our traditional business so were less likely to invest in a dbs subscriber in boston massachusetts where theyve got good internet connection from multiple sources who have an advantage in bundling both broadband and potentially ott video roger then set on task – its been almost six years now that roger was set the course to come up with product that would be meaningful to consumers in that environment so we think that were wellpositioned there we think were disciplined we think that despite the fact that analysts and headlines are about sub loss or sub gain or this arpu or that arpu or this quarter or that quarter we think were very welldisciplined to take the – one of the few companies that can take a longterm view of it and say were not afraid to change we see the change happening and how do we take advantage of the change in a way that perhaps our competitors arent doing or are slow to react or want to hold onto what they have but arent really going to where the future is and so its difficult theres course studies in mba schools theres a book written about it in terms of the entrepreneurs dilemma or whatever its called and were living that every day i forget the other part of the question was it  roger lynch  dish network corp competitor impact charles william ergen  dish network corp yeah roger can you address it roger lynch  dish network corp yeah its roger id say well one thing ive noticed is with the launch of these other ott services starting with directv now they are bigger bundle packages and so were seeing sling customers increasingly taking more addon packs so it may be a different class of customers coming into the market spurred by the big bundles that have launched in ott but were definitely seeing customers who are taking more addon packs that is certainly correlated with that charles william ergen  dish network corp yeah and this is charlie i think strategically when we started sling we were not looking to replace the cable bundle we were not looking to take a cable subscriber or for that matter a satellite subscriber and suddenly convert them into an ott because that was adding sac to get the same customer so that has not been our primary objective having said that it appears that where hulu and youtube and directv now and sony are that they all are basically replicating the cable bundle and so theres no question now that its game on to convert a cable subscriber to an ott subscriber for essentially the same services so all those guys have example the disney products with espn which is as you know one of the most costly and yet studies show and we know from our own internal data that the vast majority of people do not actually watch espn particularly yearround so youre ending up at – so that maybe theres a different strategy in there that works long term if everybodys going north maybe you should go northwest in life thomas william eagan  telsey advisory group well looking  charles william ergen  dish network corp maybe not maybe you should go north but maybe you should go northwest so my point is that i think the ott model probably initially is going be a license to lose money for people as they price things below cost eventually itll sort its way out and therell probably be several different strategies within the ott world and roger and his team are wellacquainted with potential avenues they could take thomas william eagan  telsey advisory group well in that vein charlie ott services to me seem like theyre frenemies right so they compete with each other but they also – if they get together they can change the market and they can grow it right do you see a tipping point thats going to be particularly notable as they cannibalize – they go from cannibalizing each other to taking more share away from paytv charles william ergen  dish network corp well my belief is that ott will take share away from paytv so satellite and cable will be smaller five years from now than they are today and so satellite youre already seeing that reduction right and satellite and phone companies youve seen reductions really for the last couple of years cable i think with the strength of broadband has been able to kind of tread water and i think actually potentially gain some subs and i think ultimately that will reverse too and that you will see a natural evolution to an ott product because ott in many ways can be a superior product it can be less expensive and it can be superior the questions going be what do those ott bundles look like and how chopped up does the consumer get because hes going to have a lot more choice and when he has more choice hes going to go different directions and meanwhile obviously amazon and netflix continue to grow so its a very interesting dynamic the one thing i know – the reason i sleep at night pretty well is that all those people have one thing in common they need to be connected they need connectivity for those customers to receive video and we know roger knows that the vast majority of sessions for people who are taking ott services are actually not on your tv screen but on mobile devices so that means that you need wireless spectrum to connect right and so thats one point second point id make is youre in a regulatory environment where the current administration has said theyre not in favor of – i dont want to put words in their mouth but i think correct me if im wrong theyre not really in favor of title ii theyre going to do a rulemaking on net neutrality and that theres probably a lighter regulatory touch with that which i would think to mean that the balance of power between distribution and content owners gets a little bit more level thomas william eagan  telsey advisory group super thank you operator and well take our next question from vijay jayant with evercore isi please go ahead vijay jayant  evercore isi thanks charlie based on your last comment so are you sort of implying that if wireless net neutrality is reversed then silicon valley edge providers may have more interest in controlling a distribution network in wireless and second on your comments on sling most of these media companies all tell us that theyre sort of arbitraging indifferently by selling content to these new platforms and the economics are the same if not better but youve had the product for the longest time and you havent seen any rate increase im assuming your underlying programming costs are increasing and sort of can you just talk more about the profitability and the sustainability of the ott model thanks charles william ergen  dish network corp yeah let me take the second part first its true that potentially ott economics and what we traditionally see in linear could be relatively the same for an incremental customer right in part because your sac is so much lower for your ott product and you have the potential for an advertising model to be dramatically better right so that has to be all proven out but the theory there i think still holds having said that you dont know what – when people have alternative motives if youre selling video but youre also selling shipping services you may subsidize one over the other if youre selling wireless data plans and thats very profitable you may subsidize something else so i think theres going to be some dynamics in the industry where the models move all over the place well just have to wait and see but again for us we control what we control as we have to make a technically great product a good user interface and make sure that within our programming contracts and the way that theyre offered to the consumer is both unique and economical and so thats kind of how we focus and then on your question about silicon valley i do think that its not really – let me answer broader i do think that now that the quiet periods over and for the foreseeable future most of the spectrum is auctioned off in the united states with minor exception that there – and with technology and the paradigm shift to g that i think well see a couple of things one is i think obviously you could see consolidation within the wireless industry today with incumbents consolidating in some form or fashion but i do believe that the cable industry has to take a good hard look at how they participate in this industry and potentially much more so than an mvno deal and i do think that one or more people from silicon valley will look at it more seriously not just because of perhaps net neutrality regulations being weakened but because their business depends on connectivity facebook mark zuckerberg did his year plan his first slide on his year plan it only has one word for  years and its called connectivity and so whether it be balloons or drones or connectivity or autonomous vehicles or healthcare silicon valley is all over connectivity and theyre going to have to make sure that in a world of net neutrality maybe title ii being eliminated at least i would think they have to make sure that theyre positioned so that theyre not in a situation where their traffic their connectivity is clogged and then theres a third entrant that may come which is less likely but still possible is on the international side i think that somebody ultimately is going to put together worldwide connectivity and worldwide – both on the satellite and a terrestrial basis obviously the things like oneweb on a satellite basis with lowearth satellites that could do worldwide connectivity and then youre going to do the same thing on the ground so youre going to end up with possibilities there so theres going to be a lot of movement theres probably going to be a couple of phases of movement within the connectivity industry and im pleased that we were able to participate in the megahertz auction and strengthen our position in terms of where we can go and what we can do with connectivity by the way just as a thought there was nobody in the last two auctions that has risked more capital in the connectivity business than dish along with our des and in the auction that was – the third auction the h block auction were the only major participant in that so weve been the most aggressive in that history will prove its a good strategy or bad strategy but for the investors on the call all your investments that youre making today whether it be – that youre looking at in the future whether it be autonomous vehicles or augmented reality or virtual reality or artificial intelligence or how do we get healthcare costs under control or how do you get productivity in industrial manufacturing or agriculture or what do municipalities do to make their cities safer and more productive how you do education how you do entertainment not one of those potential investors can survive without connectivity in the future not one of them so one of the things thats interesting about where dish is today is you can actually get a piece of all those investments by investing in one company because all those companies are going to have to use connectivity in their portfolio they have to right that doesnt mean that theres not more money in the valueadd on top of connectivity doesnt mean that sharing stuff with your friends about what youre watching or what youre cooking or whatever isnt more valuable because it might be but you still have to be connected vijay jayant  evercore isi okay thanks so much operator and well take our next question from marci ryvicker with wells fargo please go ahead marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc thanks two for charlie and then one for steve charlie you talk about a network build and i guess the question is are you planning to partner because the wall street perception is sort of that you have to and that its unlikely to be verizon or att that it could be someone like an amazon or anyone else outside of the ecosystem second question would be whether you would part with the dbs business separately from spectrum or should we think about those sort of married into one event if that was ever to happen and then the question for steve can you talk about trends in sac longer term so this was down  yearoveryear and if subscriber trends were to remain like this going forward would the decline continue on this trend charles william ergen  dish network corp okay marci on the network build our focus today is to build out our network to meet our  deadline with or without partners so were prepared to do it within our balance sheet and with – again its going be a new narrowband iot network that doesnt exist today so its going to attack the market from a little bit different way but its certainly very much needed in terms of the united states obviously i believe that there would be opportunity – i hope that theres opportunity the next three years where other people – for a lot of different potential partnerships for example other people and that could be – it could be verizon or att or one of the other incumbents are where theyre actually going to the tower to build out some of their spectrum so for example tmobiles going to go build  megahertz spectrum maybe starting as early as later this year theres opportunity there to say lets build that together lets build that at the same time and share the savings att and verizon are going build their aws spectrum at some point theres a chance to partner with those buildouts even though you might be separate companies in some cases you might be competitors it still might make sense because both of you save money so theres an opportunity theres tower companies that have to look longterm for new revenue sources that might want to partner in a certain sort of way and then as you mentioned theres people outside the industry who might want to protect their connectivity who might like these things so i think theres any number of combinations there but for the – right now were going to control what we can control and thats to go out and build a narrowband iot network by  and i can only go back to when we were build satellites i tried to get everybody in the world to build us a satellite we were launching dbs and nobody would do it so we got in the satellite business and built them ourself and i think were launching our  satellite this summer or something so thank god nobody wanted to – i mean thank god nobody wanted to build them for us because it wouldve cost us a lot more money but part of management is to figure out how youre going to do things and to be creative on how youre going to do things and to prove the skeptics wrong marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc does the  megahertz change the cost of the buildout charles william ergen  dish network corp it does it could – i guess it could for example im just a simple example but we have some aws spectrum its downlink only in the  gig range the limiting factor of your network is typically your uplink side so now that we have  megahertz uplink nationwide you could see with carrier aggregation that you could partner – you could put  megahertz with aws and your buildout costs could be materially less because you need less towers because youve solved some of your uplink propagation issues with  megahertz so i could make the case that the – that theres potential that much of the  billion of  megahertz spectrum actually could result in savings both on the buildout and the future operating cost on a net present value that could equate to a number pretty close to that so im not confident enough to say that for sure today but my sense is that there is probably a large savings in the buildout costs based on the  megahertz purchase the other question about separate dbs from – ive always felt that what we do at sling and dbs and spectrum all go together i think that our – i think with the  megahertz auction and the way that that really solidified the spectrum position we have that it is – it would be easier to separate some of our assets than it was before but i still think they belong together i mean obviously one could now make the case that the – both the att dbs and the dish dbs could go together and there would obviously be tremendous synergy and savings in doing that and that because of all the ot – that because the competition – it wouldnt be going from  to  it would be going from  to  because of sony and youtube – google and hulu those are all real competitors to the dbs players today so its not a – it probably is not a regulatory issue today to put those companies together and clearly those companies together would be more value for both those companies than probably the market gives them credit for today what was the other question steven e swain  dish network corp so marci on sac on a per subscriber basis the sac has been relatively stable if you will per addition on the underlying dbs ads as well as the sling ads it really depends on the mix associated with sling relative to dbs just taking a step back and looking at the strategy for dbs we have been saying for several quarters now we are acquiring and retaining higher quality customers by refocusing on worldwide of these were more disciplined on credit and were executing on several costs and revenue initiatives and as weve already mentioned on the sling side we expect to see arpu and margin expansion as it gains scale for instance we havent fully monetized our sling addressable advertising revenue opportunity yet and then lastly i already mentioned this in my preamble but for dishnet given the wholesale economics we believe its the right time for us economically which impacts sac and for our paytv customers to pivot away from the wholesale model so youll see less absolute dollars running through the pl associated with the dishnet ads as we pivot away from the wholesale model marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc thank you very much operator and well take our next question from jason bazinet with citi please go ahead jason b bazinet  citigroup global markets inc i had a question for mr ergen you talked about building a narrowband iot network and also talked about looking at spectrum on the dollar per megahertz per thing basis as opposed to pop i guess my question is this do you really think in the next five years there will be a business that is an iot business because maybe im too myopic not forward thinking enough but i sort of struggle with imagining a set of customers that could help your top line in the iot space within five years so if you could just elaborate on that a bit charles william ergen  dish network corp well i guess id answer the question iot will be a huge business and i wouldnt put the timeframe at five years i think it will be evident to everyone within five years that it will be a huge business whether that will be just like the internet was in the s and people didnt realize that the facebook and the google were going to exist because of the – i think youre kind of in the same – i think it will go faster but youre in the same situation where the possibility of internet of things is not going be – is going be underestimated longterm in terms of it just like the internet was underestimated and the cloud has been underestimated and now people are – the fortune  companies of the future have been built from those businesses so i think my – i believe internet of things will be huge whether were sitting here five years from now saying its x or year probably wont be that relevant because its ultimately going be a thousand x at some point its just hard to put a timeframe on it but you do need g so youre talking about  probably  to make it really work the way you want it to work so i think – you already kind of have internet of things i mean in a funny sort of way facebook is internet of things it just connects people to their social life right but when you can connect the city and your meters and your security and your lights and everything else the city can be more efficient and the city can save money and so theyre going to do it and anything thats cheaper and better youre going do and the internet of things for sure is going to be cheaper and better and i can think of a thousand things that need to get connected and theres probably another million things that we cant think of that other people will think of to be connected and part of what were looking at is our system to be open so that anybody who wants to participate in the network can invent things for the network jason b bazinet  citigroup global markets inc okay thank you charles william ergen  dish network corp operator i think we have time for one more before we go to the press operator sounds great thank you well take our final question from the analyst community our final analyst question comes from craig moffett with moffettnathanson please go ahead craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc thanks charlie this is a question i think everybody has been trying to ask in lots of oblique ways so let me just ask it a little more directly how has your thinking evolved as to whether you would prefer to sell your spectrum lease your spectrum or lease the network or just run it yourself i guess as an outside observer it would seem buying  megahertz spectrum is a lot more consistent with someone who actually wants to run a network than with someone who is looking to sell spectrum is that a reasonable interpretation of your participation in the auction charles william ergen  dish network corp well i mean i think one of the things you do when you start a business youd like that business to last more than  years which is youd like your business to last  years so obviously we think pivoting to connectivity allows us to have a much longer runway for our company but i think the way i would answer the question is were looking for whatever ultimately would enhance our shareholder value and our customers and our employees experience and we think – at least today – we think that that is somebody who is looking at the wireless world in a disruptive manner that says the wireless connectivity in the united states is going to be different than four guys who you can make phone calls on and you can send a text and maybe you can stream a little bit of video right and you have an unlimited plan thats  gigs but they call it unlimited so you have a limited unlimited plan we think the world of wireless can be materially different than that it can be different because theres a paradigm shift in technology the way you build your radio the way youre going to propagate your network whether it be inside out maybe inside out instead of outside in whether your core and how you do your network the ability to slice your network in different slices the ability to let other people share your network all those things are possible in the g world and for somebody who shares that vision of where things can go we could get pretty excited about if somebody says were going to just do the same thing were doing today were not that interested in that because we dont think that builds longterm shareholder value for our shareholders so we try to look at where things are going instead of where they are craig eder moffett  moffettnathanson llc thank you charlie operator we will now take questions from the members of the media our first media question comes from scott moritz with bloomberg please go ahead scott moritz  bloomberg news hey thanks charlie i guess i know its only been four days but have you folks received any kind of inquiries yet on deals and are you surprised at all by the activity or lack of activity in that period and also a second question a lot of speculation around sprint tmobile obviously if that deal happens would you feel like you needed to object to it try to block it or would you feel there are still many other options available to you charles william ergen  dish network corp yeah scott youve known us for a while we dont – we wont – were pretty private im certainly a pretty private individual so were not going to comment in any way on discussions that take place dont take place rumors that are true rumors that are not true rumors that are outlandish or whatever were just not going to comment on that and our conversations that we have with people we keep private so youre not going read about them in the paper or a book so thats just the way we do business and were continuing to do that obviously there could be consolidation within the industry certainly sprint and tmobile would be a possible combination of companies and if there were to be a combination of companies wed take a look at it to see whether we thought that that combination was detrimental to the consumer or detrimental to competition or not and we wouldnt be opposed to consolidation just because its consolidation wed only be opposed to it if we thought it had an impact on competition so we havent objected to some consolidations in the past out there and others we have and i think were kind of like the justice department we look at each – and the fcc we look at each case individually and try to make a judgment as to how thats going to affect competition operator well take our next question from ben markus with colorado public radio please go ahead ben markus  colorado public radio hi guys just generally looking back at the last few quarters how is it that subscriber base and revenue is eroding yet profits are going up are you just becoming more efficient as a company charles william ergen  dish network corp ben its a good – i think its because weve really turned our investment to the future investment – the majority of our future investment to connectivity and obviously in spectrum purchases so that we can be a viable company in the st century so the return on investment in a mature industry normally declines so the return on investment from a customer that we would go out and spend  sac from  years ago is a different profile than if we go spend  a sac for a customer today given the rising cost of programming and the decline in viewership of traditional linear channels so i think were just trying to allocate our capital more precisely and what that has led to is pretty flat revenue i mean most economic metrics over the last couple years have been pretty flat for us but were building for the future and so you while youre investing in the future youre not going to get those revenues from the future so were just building on our first networks its going to take us three years to build our network so were not going get a ton of revenue from our investment for three more years right and then we think that that jump starts a whole another growth phase for dish operator well take our next question with jonathan chaplin with new street research please go ahead jonathan chaplin  new street research llp us thanks question for mr ergen id just like to followup on your answer to craigs question were you saying that effectively if verizon or att wanted to buy your spectrum to support their existing business that you wouldnt sell it to them no matter what the price is they have to share your vision of the future if youd be willing to sell it or lease it to them charles william ergen  dish network corp jonathan when did you get in the press jonathan chaplin  new street research llp us i charles william ergen  dish network corp youre such a great investment banker and analyst you know and now youre in the press i didnt know that jonathan chaplin  new street research llp us ill do anything to speak to you mr ergen charles william ergen  dish network corp well i appreciate that im not saying that what im saying is that obviously this is a board decision if somebody came in and said heres cash offer and you looked at tax consequences that offer was more than you thought you could do with your business yourself thats something that our board would consider to extent that you took equity for something like that youd want to make sure your equity was going go up in value more than staying your current course and so those are all the kind of considerations that youd want to have out there but the – most management in public companies has a hard time taking a long view right and making longterm investments because they get pounded by everybody if their sales go down or their earnings per share missed by a penny or whatever so they have a hard time which is why you see crazy offers where you can get – i mean you could get apple tv box that costs  but you could get it for  if you sign up for three months of programming that probably costs  so in that particular case that company probably lost  on every customer they got well why would you do that you might do that for strategic reasons but we also want to make sure your numbers dont go down for wall street well id prefer to save the  and then put it into something else thats going make money longterm so we really think the wireless industry is right for a new way of doing things and a new way that you would build a network and new architecture take advantage of g and the internet of things and i dont doubt that there are people within the incumbents today that share that vision right whether they can get through their boards and take longterm measures it might be a different story but to extent they could i think theyd be attractive people to talk to jonathan chaplin  new street research llp us great thanks very much charles william ergen  dish network corp
