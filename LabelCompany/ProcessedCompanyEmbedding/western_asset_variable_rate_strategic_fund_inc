legg mason  what i should know before investing the fund is a nondiversified closedend management investment company designed primarily as a long term investment and not as a trading vehicle the fund invests in fixedincome securities which are subject to credit risks including the risk of nonpayment of scheduled interest or loan payments which could lower the fund’s value the fund’s investments are subject to credit risk inflation risk and interest rate risk as interest rates rise the value of a fixedincome portfolio generally declines reducing the value of the fund however the fund can normally be expected to have less significant interest rate related fluctuations in its nav than investment companies investing primarily in fixedrate fixedincome securities other than money market funds because the floating or variable rate securities in which the fund invests float in response to changes in prevailing market interest rates mortgagebacked securities are subject to additional risks such as prepayment and extension risk which can limit the potential gains in a declining interest rate environment the fund may invest in highyield and foreign securities including emerging markets which involve risks beyond those inherent solely in higher rated and domestic investments highyield bonds involve greater credit and liquidity risks than investment grade bonds investing in foreign securities is subject to certain risks typically not associated with domestic investing such as currency fluctuations and changes in political conditions these risks are magnified in emerging or developing markets derivatives such as options or futures can be illiquid and hard to value especially in declining markets a small investment in certain derivatives may have a potentially large
