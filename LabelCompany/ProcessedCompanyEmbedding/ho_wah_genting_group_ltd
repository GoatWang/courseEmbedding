        • black card member s     with our group’s foresight of the rising competition in the leisure and gaming industry our main priority is to develop and acquire a unique premium market database via online subscription to our membership program with the asian market in sight we believe a huge database of users will result in better negotiation leverage to secure the best deals for our members thereby fortifying our unique selling propositions   in connection to our exclusive travel membership we also provide junket operating services by promoting premium market players to our partner’s resorts and cruise lines we currently have an agreement to operate as a licensed junket operator for genting malaysia berhad a malaysian public company involved in the leisure and hospitality business covering theme parks gaming hotels seaside resorts and entertainment for over fifty years throughout asia and genting hong kong limited a hongkong based investment holding company principally engaged in cruise businesses to date hwgg is an approved junket operator and local group casino rebate programme for genting malaysia berhad’s casino in peninsular malaysia and genting hong kong limited’s entire star cruises fleet and resorts world manila pursuant to the travel and junket service contract we shared  of the commission earned through certain junket operations with hwgh starting  hwgg takes  of the junket commission from its operations with hwgh our exclusive travel membership members may exchange their mrps for junket services at various leisure entities such as resorts and cruises offered by our strategic partners hwgg earns an average of    for the rolling activities of our players            with such an attractive lineup of privileges and benefits exclusively available to our members we believe our membership program will stand out as a popular product in asia’s premium entertainment market our exclusive travel membership will further add value to the company as we progress into a future that is increasingly dominated by big data technologies   marketing plan overview and business strategy   according to the world travel and tourism council travel and tourism generated  trillion usd and  million jobs for the global economy in  in that same year the world travel and tourism council also noted that international tourist arrivals also surged reaching nearly  billion  of which were visitors from emerging economies up from  in    through our exclusive travel membership we intend to tap the travel and tourism industry particularly through asia’s emerging markets we currently provide service arrangements to our partners’ exclusive entertainment lounges located in malaysia singapore philippines and china through the growth of our membership we believe we will gain better negotiation power for the best travel deals for our members enhancing our unique selling points products and services that we offer our customers   as china reigns supreme as asia’s biggest superpower it is the biggest market when it comes to membership acquisition due to its large population and huge spending power we believe china will be one of the biggest contributors to our company’s revenue due to our strategic partner’s fleet of cruises launched in the china region   we also believe our junket operation business will be a huge contributor to our future revenue according to the statistic portal in  the global casino gaming market was projected to have a volume of  billion usd based on business wire news asia comprises sixty percent of the world population and is home to many of the world’s top ten biggest casinos by gambling revenue which are located in macau and singapore   we believe in our strategic partner’s vision of not only promoting the gaming industry but also marketing family focused entertainment such as entertainment parks shopping malls and concerts this diverse marketing approach of our partners will help attract not only the premium market but also satisfy the mass market as well since the company promotes our strategic partners’ resorts and cruises any promotion of these entertainment and travel destinations will indirectly benefit the company this is a distinct advantage for the company as it builds our market exposure for our products   to ensure that our exclusive travel membership and junket operation services become known throughout asia we plan to release and promote information through word of mouth promotion and organizing events to further increase our brand recognition   competition and competitive strengths   our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications and social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets many of our competitors are well established substantially larger and have substantially greater market recognition greater resources and broader capabilities than we have there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors the competitive pressures that we face may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations   we believe that while we currently may have disadvantages in the travel and entertainment market the growth of this market will allow us to earn additional market share if we can expand our membership database and maintain reliable responsive and quality service to our exclusive travel membership members and partners   we intend to use our expertise in the asian markets and a userfriendly website to compete with the major competitors in this field we plan to compete on the basis of ease of use pricing and customer preference   junket operation is a niche market competition is not high however it requires a substantial network of highroller tourists in order to attract vip players by providing discount rewards high quality services and with the continuously growing network that our senior management has we believe that we are able to pull the necessary vip players to be successful   real estate investment business   prior to entering the entertainment and travel industry hwgg was primary engaged in residential and commercial property investment and development in kuala lumpur malaysia throughout the years we have been approached by property developers and investors requesting that we study property projects in malaysia our portfolio currently consists of a condominium in kuala lumpur malaysia which generates rental income for us we may sell or purchase further properties if opportunities arise that we believe will maximize our overall asset values   according to local news sources in malaysia malaysia’s property market has softened considerably in  due to cooling measures implemented by its government including stricter and more stringent loan requirements according to a report published by malaysia’s real estate and housing developers association loan rejection rates have been reported to be as high as  negatively impacting the country’s property market a goods and services tax “gst” was implemented across the board on april   and property transactions in the first quarter of the year fell by  from  for the same period in  new property prices are estimated to have increased by  due to higher material costs while malaysia’s property market has achieved relative stability compared with the bull run of recent years it is perceived that this is largely due to the economic situation in the country and not due to the implementation of gst domestic buyers are increasingly unable to enter the property market at affordable levels which has resulted in market stagnation in certain regions of malaysia the ringgit malaysia fell at a year low has caused the property investment market to subdue due to market uncertainties            notwithstanding these measures we expect the housing market to remain resilient and sustainable in the near future according to an article published by asean today properties in malaysia will hit a peak by year  surveys conducted by local reputable firms specializing in analyzing malaysian investment behavior noted that malaysians prefer to invest in property due to higher yields on rental good appreciation retirement plan for better environment and for affordable pricing our management believes that foreign investors actually favor malaysian property due to malaysia’s modern and sophisticated infrastructure that is being further enhanced by government initiatives to facilitate foreign investment in malaysia including tax incentives and easing of laws governing foreign ownership of property we believe that the property cycle has or will be reaching its bottom line soon and the cycle will turn within these few years even with a slowdown in property transaction our management believes the price of the properties does not drop much most of the properties either go up in price or remain unchanged and that real estate investment remains attractive to foreign buyers due to malaysian’s weaker ringgit which mean the properties in malaysia are relatively cheap to foreign investors all this information provides assurance to us that the property sector in malaysia remains solid and that now is the best time to invest in this industry we also believe that by remaining in the property investment industry we will capture this market by building our brand name   we may not be able to compete with the big companies at our current stage our competitors may have larger financial capacities greater resource availability and more diversification in terms of their property portfolios and experience  our competitive strategies will focus on the following key areas lease and sales strategy target local market mostly mid income earner target foreign market partly mid income earner and partly high income earner and strategize location with a reasonable pricing   we have engaged project managers to look into enhancing this sector of our business and are in the early state of exploring and planning our next property investment project on november   we acquired rights to purchase  units in a condominium development scheduled to be completed no later than december   in negeri johor malaysia at  below market price pursuant to such agreement we are able to resale the units to customers at market price we will earn approximately  of the gross revenue for each unit that we are able to sell by december   and have no obligations to purchase any units that we are unable to find customers for   information technology business   on june   hwgg acquired  of the equity interests of beedo sdn bhd a malaysian corporation that specializes in information technology services “beedo” on july   beedo increased its issued and paidup shares from  to  hwgg acquired an additional  shares on that date making its balance of shares  and effectively diluting its ownership in beedo from  to  on august   hwgg completed the disposal of its subsidiary beedo by wholly transferring the shares it owns to a related party dato’ lim hui boon for the consideration of  rm  since selling its interest of beedo we no longer participate in the information technology services industry   long term plans   our long term plan is to expand our travel and entertainment and junket operation business throughout asia and to the united states particularly in las vegas nevada to achieve this we will continue to make improvements on our exclusive travel membership and network of vip players and receive feedback from our members and strategic partners we will also need to conduct further research and studies to better understand the travel and tourism business and junket operator requirements in those markets   additionally we plan to create an online gaming platform to enhance our membership services the global online gambling market is expected to grow at a rate of up to  from  to  according to technavio’s report as released in late  the american gaming association says the online gambling market is currently valued at approximately us  billion annually and  countries have chosen to legalize internet gambling with regard to the united states only a few states have permitted online casino gambling to date including nevada new jersey and delaware a significant share of global online gambling revenue comes from europe according to the european commission the online gambling market is about  billion per year and it is growing at a rate of approximately  on an annual basis we believe that the online gambling sector is an industry that can contribute significantly to our revenue and further enhance our shareholder value   another long term plan is to set up an investment fund our management team is currently working with a few investment firms to form connections in order to further contribute to our revenue   our management has experience in the hong kong malaysia and us markets our management has helped raise funds for various companies to be used as working capital and other corporate exercise matters including mergers and acquisitions our management has also conducted due diligence for more than  different types of industries mining construction properties manufacturing food and beverage trading beauty products furniture products and others for potential investment purposes with the experience of our management team we believe that opening an investment fund will be a viable and profitable option to enhance the value of our company overtime we intend to work with reputable partners to invest in securities and other permitted assets to generate an additional revenue stream and increase profit for our shareholders            patents and trademarks   at the present we do not have any patents or trademarks   need for any government approval of services   we do not require any government approval for our services   in the event any of our operations or services requires government approval we will comply with any and all local state and federal requirements   government and industry regulation   we are committed to complying with all federal state and international laws governing our business operations   we believe that we comply with the requirements in malaysia for any licenses or approvals to pursue our proposed business plan in locations where we operate the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licensee and approvals and to implement regulations possible sanctions which may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in a particular business for specific periods of time revocation of licenses censures redress to customers and fines we may be prevented from operating if our activities are not in compliance with domestic malaysian regulations   in addition we may be subject to various laws and regulations globally particularly with respect to our travel and entertainment segment of our business many countries have either implemented new laws or made revisions to existing laws on travel and entertainment particularly in the gaming industry in the last decade we may be prevented from operating if our activities are not in compliance with certain foreign regulations and must take action to comply with such relevant laws and regulations   as a junket operator we may deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and may be subject to various reporting and antimoney laundering regulations such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted which could adversely affect our operating results   furthermore our real estate investments are subject to extensive local city county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting zoning subdivision utilities and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats such regulation may delay future plans of development of our current and future properties and result in higher than anticipated developmental and administrative costs   research and development activities   other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets and segmentation the company has not spent any funds on research and development activities to date in the event opportunities arise from our operations the company may elect to initiate research and development activities but the company has no plans for any activities to date   environmental laws   our operations are not subject to any environmental laws   employees   we currently have  full time employees all of which are located in malaysia none of our employees are members of any labor union and we have never experienced any business interruption as a result of any labor disputes   internet access to other information   information included on our website does not constitute part of this report   item a risk factors   risk factors   an investment in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk we face a variety of risks that may affect our operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict before investing in the securities you should carefully consider the following risks together with the financial and other information contained in this report if any of the following risks actually occurs our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in that case the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment only those investors who can bear the risk of loss of their entire investment should consider an investment in our securities            this report contains certain statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of our company prospective investors are cautioned that such statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties and that actual events or results may differ materially in evaluating such statements prospective investors should specifically consider the various factors identified in this report including the matters set forth below which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forwardlooking statements   if any of the following or other risks materialize the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected which in turn could adversely impact the value of our common stock in such a case investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment   prospective investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the company is suitable for them in light of the information contained in this report and the financial resources available to them the risks described below do not purport to be all the risks to which the company or the company could be exposed this section is a summary of certain risks and is not set out in any particular order of priority they are the risks that we presently believe are material to the operations of the company additional risks of which we are not presently aware or which we presently deem immaterial may also impair the company’s business financial condition or results of operations   risks related to our business and the industry in which we operate   we cannot assure you that we will be profitable   there is no assurance that we will be profitable now or in the future we forecast our future expense levels based on our operating plans and our estimates of future revenues we may find it necessary to significantly accelerate expenditures relating to our sales and marketing efforts or otherwise increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand awareness among internet users and advertisers we may also make investments in our products discontinue underperforming products as well as develop new products that may impact our profitability if our revenues grow at a slower rate than we anticipate or decline or if our spending levels exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted to reflect slower revenue growth we may not generate sufficient revenues to be profitable any of these developments could result in a significant decrease in the trading price of our common stock   we have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our future prospects   hwgg did not enter the travel planning junket operations and information technology services industry until  as an early stage company it is difficult for our management and our investors to accurately forecast and evaluate our future prospects and our financial results our operations are therefore subject to all of the risks inherent in light of the expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the formation of any new business as well as those risks that are specific to our business in particular an investment in an early stage company such as ours involves a degree of risk including the possibility that entire investments may be lost the risks include but are not limited to the possibility that we will not be able to develop expected marketing and distribution channels attract sufficient numbers of members or products andor services which will be accepted in the market to successfully introduce and market our products and services we must establish brand name recognition and competitive advantages for our products and services there are no assurances that we can successfully address these challenges if we are unsuccessful we and our business financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected   our business is sensitive to the willingness of our customers to travel acts of terrorism regional political events and developments in the conflicts in certain countries could cause severe disruptions in travel that reduce the number of our active members resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows   we are dependent on the willingness of our customers and members to travel acts of terrorism may severely disrupt domestic and international travel which would result in a decrease in customers desire to travel regional conflicts could have a similar effect on domestic and international travel management cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act outbreak of hostilities or escalation of war would have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows   natural or manmade disasters an outbreak of highly infectious disease terrorist activity or war could adversely affect customers’ willingness to travel and disrupt our operations resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows   so called “acts of god” such as typhoons particularly in macao and other natural disasters manmade disasters outbreaks of highly infectious diseases such as avian flu sars and hn flu terrorist activity or war may result in decreases in travel to and from and economic activity in areas in which we offer travel discounts packages and awards and may adversely affect the number of our active members any of these events also may disrupt our ability to adequately staff our business could generally disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows   we will rely on third parties to develop the products and services which we offer and sell   we will not develop the travel products packages and services which we offer and sell therefore our success will substantially depend upon our ability to develop maintain and expand our strategic relationships with our partners any impairment in our relationship with these partners could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these relationships on commercially reasonable terms if at all            our products and services may not be accepted in the market   we cannot be certain that the products and services which we may determine to market and sell will achieve or maintain market acceptance market acceptance of our products and services depends on many factors including our ability to convince individuals to join our exclusive travel membership present our products and services as more attractive than competing products and services and price products and services competitively   if we are unable to retain our existing members and recruit additional members our revenue will not increase and may even decline   our members may terminate their services at any time and we will experience relatively high turnover among our members from year to year people who join us to purchase our products and services for personal consumption frequently will only stay with us for a short time to increase our revenue we must increase the number of our members   if our initiatives do not drive growth in the number of our members our operating results could be harmed our operating results could be harmed if we do not generate sufficient interest in our business and or products and services to retain and motivate our existing members and attract new members to join us   the number and productivity of our members could be harmed by several additional factors including   • any adverse publicity regarding us our products and services our distribution channels or our competitors   • lack of interest in dissatisfaction with or the technical failure of existing or new products and services   • lack of compelling products or services or income opportunities that generate interest   • any negative public perception of our products and services   • our actions to enforce our policies and procedures   • any regulatory actions or charges against us or others in our industry   • general economic and business conditions and   • potential saturation or maturity levels in a given country or market which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members in such market   laws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict the business that we are involved in and cause our revenue and profitability to decline and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business   various government agencies throughout the world regulate travelling and entertainment practices different country has different laws and regulations in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate and expect to operate are stringent than others and subject to broad discretion in enforcement by regulators   complying with these widely varying and sometimes inconsistent rules and regulations can be difficult timeconsuming and expensive and may require significant resources the laws and regulations may modify from time to time this can require us to make changes to our business model and aspects of our sales plan in the markets impacted by such changes if we are unable to continue business in existing markets or commence operations in new markets because of these laws our revenue and profitability may decline   adverse publicity concerning our business marketing plan products and services or people could harm our business and reputation   expected growth in our member base and consumers and our results of operations can be particularly impacted by adverse publicity regarding us the nature business model our products and services or the actions of our members and employees given the nature of our operations and our continuous need to recruit and retain consumers and members we are particularly vulnerable to adverse publicity   critics of our industry and individuals who want to pursue an agenda may in the future utilize the internet the press and other means to publish criticisms of the industry our company and our competitors or make allegations regarding our business and operations or the business and operations of our competitors we or others in our industry may receive similar negative publicity or allegations in the future and it may harm our business and reputation            our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political legal tax and regulatory risks   our ability to capitalize on growth in international markets is exposed to risks associated with our international operations including   • the possibility that a foreign government might ban or severely restrict our business method especially our junket business or that local civil unrest political instability or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in an international market   • the lack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate or expect to operate   • the presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets in which we operate or expect to operate   • the possibility that a government authority might impose legal tax or other financial burdens on us or our sales force due for example to the structure of our operations in various markets and   • the possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting our ability to repatriate cash   government authorities may question our tax or customs positions or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business   as a us company doing business globally we are subject to all applicable tax and customs laws including those relating to intercompany pricing regulations and transactions between our corporate entities in the jurisdictions in which we do business we expect that periodically we will be audited by tax and customs authorities around the world if authorities challenge our tax or customs positions including those regarding transfer pricing and customs valuation and classification we may be subject to penalties interest and payment of back taxes or customs duties since tax rates vary from country to country any tax assessments might also impact our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credits on our us consolidated tax return the tax and customs laws in each jurisdiction are continually changing and are further subject to interpretation by the local government agencies despite our best efforts to be aware of and comply with tax and customs laws including changes to and interpretations thereof there is a potential risk that the local authorities may argue that we are out of compliance such situations may require that we defend our positions andor adjust our operating procedures in response to such changes any or all of these potential risks may increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business   we do not carry any business interruption insurance product liability or recall insurance or thirdparty liability insurance   our business operations may involve many risks including natural disasters labor disturbances business interruptions property damage personal injury and death we do not carry any business interruption insurance or thirdparty liability insurance for our business to cover claims in respect of personal injury or property or environmental damage arising from accidents on our property or relating to our operations therefore we may not have insurance coverage sufficient to cover all risks associated with our business as a result we may be required to pay for financial and other losses damages and liabilities including those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control out of our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we depend on our key personnel and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business and results of operations   our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management and other key employees many of whom would be difficult to replace our senior management and key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time in addition we need to continue to attract and develop qualified management personnel to sustain growth in our markets if we are not able to successfully retain existing personnel and identify hire and integrate new personnel our business and growth prospects could be harmed   the inability of our products and services and other initiatives to gain or maintain market acceptance could harm our business   our operating results could be adversely affected if our products and services business opportunities and other initiatives do not generate sufficient enthusiasm and economic benefit to attract new consumers and people interested in joining our exclusive travel membership potential factors affecting the attractiveness of our products and services business opportunities and other initiatives include among other items perceived product and service quality product and service exclusivity or effectiveness economic success in our business opportunity adverse media attention or regulatory restrictions on claims   in addition our ability to develop and introduce new products and services could be impacted by among other items government regulations the inability to attract and retain qualified development staff the termination of thirdparty collaborative arrangements intellectual property of competitors that may limit our ability to offer innovative products and services or that challenge our own intellectual property and difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences            our markets are intensely competitive and market conditions and the strengths of competitors may harm our business   the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive our results of operations may be harmed by market conditions and competition in the future many competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than we have which may give them a competitive advantage   any failure of our internal controls over financial reporting or our compliance efforts could harm our stock price and our financial and operating results or could result in fines or penalties   we have implemented internal controls to help ensure the accuracy of our financial reporting and have implemented compliance policies and programs to help ensure that our employees comply with applicable laws and regulations we regularly assess the effectiveness of our internal controls there can be no assurance however that our internal or external assessments and audits will identify all significant or material weaknesses in our internal controls any failure to correct a weakness in internal controls could result in the disclosure of a material weakness if a material weakness results in a material misstatement in our financial results we may also have to restate our financial statements   from time to time we may initiate further investigations into our business operations based on the results of our internal and external audits or on complaints questions or allegations made by employees or other parties regarding our business practices and operations in addition our business and operations may be investigated by applicable government authorities in the event any of these investigations identify material violations of applicable laws by our employees we could be subject to adverse publicity fines penalties or loss of licenses or permits   cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of our member data could expose us to data loss litigation and liability and our reputation could be significantly harmed   we will collect and retain large volumes of member data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for business purposes including for transactional and promotional purposes and our various information technology systems enter process summarize and report such data the integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business we are subject to significant security and privacy regulations as well as requirements imposed by the credit card industry maintaining compliance with these evolving regulations and requirements could be difficult and may increase our expenses in addition a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of company employee or member data which could harm our reputation disrupt our operations or result in remedial and other costs fines or lawsuits   some of the markets in which we operate may become highly inflationary which could negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows   in some of our markets we face risks associated with high levels of inflation high levels of inflation and currency devaluations in any of our markets could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations   some of the markets in which we operate have currency controls in place which may restrict our repatriation of cash   if foreign governments restrict transfers of cash out of their country and control exchange rates we may be limited as to the timing and amount of cash we can repatriate and may not be able to repatriate cash at beneficial exchange rates which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows   our business could be severely harmed if the malaysian government changes its policies laws regulations tax structure or its current interpretations of its laws rules and regulations relating to our operations in malaysia   our business is located in kuala lumpur malaysia and virtually all of our assets are located in malaysia majority of our members and customers are located in malaysia our results of operations financial state of affairs and future growth are to a significant degree subject to malaysia’s economic political and legal development and related uncertainties our operations and results could be materially affected by a number of factors including but not limited to   • changes in policies by the malaysian government resulting in changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation of laws or regulations            • changes in taxation • changes in employment restrictions • import duties and • currency revaluation   failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and chinese anticorruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences   our executive officers employees and other agents may violate applicable law in connection with the marketing or sale of our products and services including china’s anticorruption laws and the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa which generally prohibits united states companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business in addition we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls the prc also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials however corruption extortion bribery payoffs theft and other fraudulent practices occur from timetotime in the prc   while we intend to implement measures to ensure compliance with the fcpa and chinese anticorruption laws by all individuals involved with our company our employees or other agents may engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible if our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our brand and reputation our sales activities or the price of our ordinary shares could be adversely affected if we become the target of any negative publicity as a result of actions taken by our employees or other agents   we have not had and do not intend to have any current or historic experience with noncompliance with fcpa or chinese anticorruption laws   our current management team has very limited experience in operating a public company and complying with public company obligations   our current management team has limited experience in operating a publicly traded company in the united states as a public company we are subject to a number of requirements including the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended and the sarbanesoxley act of  these requirements might place a strain on our systems resources and management and as a result our management’s attention might be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results    risk factors to our real estate property investment business   if we are unable to find suitable real estate property investments we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives   our ability to achieve our investment objectives depends upon the performance of our management in the acquisition of our real estate property investments including the determination of any financing arrangements and upon the performance of our property managers in the selection of tenants and negotiation of leasing arrangements the current market for properties meeting our investment objectives is highly competitive as is the leasing market for such properties we are also subject to competition in seeking to acquire real estaterelated investments we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining suitable investments on financially attractive terms or that our investment objectives will be achieved   our inability to sell or lease a property when we desire could adversely affect our business   many factors that are beyond our control affect the real estate market and could affect our ability to sell or lease properties for the price on the terms or within the time frame that we desire these factors include general economic conditions the availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand because real estate investments are relatively illiquid we will have a limited ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions further before we can sell or lease a property on the terms we want it may be necessary to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements we however can give no assurance that we will have the funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements we may be unable to sell or lease our properties at a profit our inability to sell or lease properties at the time and on the terms we want could reduce our cash flow and future earnings   potential development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks may hinder our operating results and decrease our net income   from time to time we may acquire unimproved real property or properties that are under development or construction investments in such properties will be subject to the uncertainties associated with the development and construction of real property including those related to rezoning land for development environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups and our builders’ ability to build in conformity with plans specifications budgeted costs and timetables if a builder fails to perform we may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance a builder’s performance may also be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder’s control delays in completing construction could also give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases we may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to builders before they complete construction these and other factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment in addition we will be subject to normal leaseup risks relating to newly constructed projects we also must rely on rental income and expense projections and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a purchase price at the time we acquire the property if our projections are inaccurate we may pay too much for a property and the return on our investment could suffer            competition with third parties in acquiring properties and other investments may reduce our profitability and the return on our stockholders’ investment   we believe that the current market for properties that meet our investment objectives is extremely competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities including individuals corporations bank and insurance company investment accounts real estate limited partnerships and trusts and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities larger real estate investment companies may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from among other things a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investments may increase if we pay higher prices for properties and other investments our returns will be lower and the value of our assets may not appreciate or may decrease significantly below the amount we paid for such assets if such events occur our stockholders may experience a lower return on their investment   risks related to our financial condition   we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future   we have incurred losses since our inception we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to grow our business engage new members to our exclusive travel membership and invest in real estate property these efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate and we may not succeed in generating sufficient revenues to offset these higher expenses if we are unable to do so the company and its business financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected   our operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern if we do not continue as a going concern investors could lose their entire investment   our historical operating losses and lack of revenues to support our cost structure raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern if we do not generate revenues do not achieve profitability and do not have other sources of financing for our business we may have to curtail or cease our development plans and operations which could cause investors to lose the entire amount of their investment   our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board the american institute of certified public accountants the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change   we may incur significant costs to ensure compliance with united states corporate governance and accounting requirements   we may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  and other rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly we also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs hwgg our operating company is newly reporting and we are adjusting to the increased disclosure requirements for us to comply with corporate governance and accounting requirements            investment risks   you could lose all of your investment   an investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk potential investors should be aware that the value of an investment in the company may go down as well as up in addition there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment in the company will fully reflect its underlying value you could lose your entire investment   you may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock   in the future we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders and the purchasers of our shares offered hereby the company will be authorized to issue an aggregate of  shares of common stock we may issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees future acquisitions future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes the future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock we will need to raise additional capital in the near future to meet our working capital needs and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with these capital raising efforts including at a price or exercise prices below the price you paid for your stock   there currently is no public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that a public market will ever develop failure to develop or maintain a trading market could negatively affect the value of our common stock and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares   there is currently no public market for shares of our common stock and one may never develop our common stock is quoted on the otc markets the otc markets is a thinly traded market and lacks the liquidity of certain other public markets with which some investors may have more experience we may not ever be able to satisfy the listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on a national securities exchange which is often a more widelytraded and liquid market some but not all of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widelytraded and liquid market include the following our stockholders’ equity may be insufficient the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low our net income from operations may be too low our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held we may not be able to secure market makers for our common stock and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and markets to have our common stock listed should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges or our common stock is otherwise rejected for listing and remains listed on the otc markets or is suspended from the otc markets the trading price of our common stock could suffer and the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility   our common stock is subject to the “penny stock” rules of the sec and the trading market in the securities is limited which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock   rule g under the exchange act establishes the definition of a “penny stock” for the purposes relevant to us as any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share or with an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require a that a broker or dealer approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks and b the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased   in order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer must a obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and b make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks   the broker or dealer must also deliver prior to any transaction in a penny stock a disclosure schedule prescribed by the sec relating to the penny stock market which in highlight form a sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and b confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction generally brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules this may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock   disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions finally monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks            our stock may be traded infrequently and in low volumes so you may be unable to sell your shares at or near the quoted bid prices if you need to sell your shares   until our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange such as the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq stock market we expect our common stock to remain eligible for quotation on the otc markets or on another overthecounter quotation system or in the “pink sheets” in those venues however the shares of our common stock may trade infrequently and in low volumes meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent an investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock or to sell his or her shares at or near bid prices or at all in addition if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in sec regulations various requirements would be imposed by law on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors consequently such regulations may deter brokerdealers from recommending or selling our common stock which may further affect the liquidity of our common stock this would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital   we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and investors may lose the entire amount of their investment   cash dividends have never been declared or paid on our common stock and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future we expect to use future earnings if any to fund business growth therefore stockholders will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares of common stock if we do not pay dividends our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates we cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment   being a public company is expensive and administratively burdensome   as a public reporting company we are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the securities act the exchange act and other federal securities laws rules and regulations related thereto including compliance with the sarbanesoxley act complying with these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our board of directors and management and increases our expenses among other things we are required to   • maintain and evaluate a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act and the related rules and regulations of the sec and the public company accounting oversight board   • maintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures   • prepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws   • institute a more comprehensive compliance function including with respect to corporate governance and   • involve to a greater degree our outside legal counsel and accountants in the above activities   the costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports proxy statements and other information with the sec and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is expensive and much greater than that of a privatelyheld company and compliance with these rules and regulations may require us to hire additional financial reporting internal controls and other finance personnel and will involve a material increase in regulatory legal and accounting expenses and the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner if at all in addition being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our board of directors particularly directors willing to serve on an audit committee which we expect to establish   as a result of members of our management being our largest stockholders they can exert significant control over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of other stockholders    our executive management team owns or controls a significant percentage of our common stock additionally this does not reflect the increased percentages that they may have in the event that they exercise any of the options or warrants they may in the future be granted or if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our common stock the interests of such persons may differ from the interests of other stockholders as a result in addition to their positions with us such persons will have significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote including the following actions   • elect or defeat the election of our directors • amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws            • effect or prevent a merger sale of assets or other corporate transaction and • control the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote   in addition such persons’ stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price   we may not be able to achieve secondary trading of our stock in certain states because our common stock is not nationally traded which could subject our stockholders to significant restrictions and costs   because our common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange our common stock is subject to the securities laws of the various states and jurisdictions of the united states in addition to federal securities law these laws cover any primary offering we might attempt and all secondary trading by our stockholders while we may register our common stock or qualify for exemptions for our common stock in one of more states if we fail to do so the investors in those states where we have not taken such steps may not be allowed to purchase our stock or those who presently hold our stock may not be able to resell their shares without substantial effort and expense these restrictions and potential costs could be significant burdens on our stockholders      the risks above do not necessarily comprise all of those associated with an investment in the company this report contains forward looking statements that involve unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results financial condition performance or

disclosures about fair value measurements   fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market

used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   • level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   • level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments   • level  inputs to the valuation methodology are

observable market data when available in making fair value measurements when inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurements valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize

  goodwill and intangible assets   goodwill is calculated as the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment at the reporting unit level   under applicable accounting guidance the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep test the first step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired however if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step must be performed to measure potential impairment the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated possible impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step over the aggregate fair values of the assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination   measurement of the fair values of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit is consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting guidance which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the adjustments to measure the assets liabilities and intangibles at fair value are for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the consolidation balance sheet if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess an impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit an impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment

operating expense in    for intangible assets subject to amortization an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value the

decisions of the company   a transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties     f        recently issued accounting pronouncements   the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no  income statement  extraordinary and unusual items subtopic  simplifying income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items   the fasb issued this asu as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the objective of the simplification initiative is to identify evaluate and improve areas of us gaap for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to the users of financial statements   this asu eliminates from us gaap the concept of extraordinary items subtopic  income statement  extraordinary and unusual items required that an entity separately classify present and disclose extraordinary events and transactions presently an event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item   if an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement net of tax after income from continuing operations the entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earningspershare data applicable to the extraordinary item   the fasb heard from stakeholders that the concept of extraordinary items causes uncertainty because it is unclear when an item should be considered both unusual and infrequent additionally some stakeholders said that although users find information about unusual or infrequent events and transactions useful they do not find the extraordinary item classification and presentation necessary to identify those events and transactions other stakeholders noted that it is extremely rare in current practice for a transaction or event to meet the requirements to be presented as an extraordinary item   this asu will also align more closely us gaap income statement presentation guidance with ias  presentation of financial statements which prohibits the presentation and disclosure of extraordinary items   the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   a reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively a reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements early

the fasb has issued an accounting standards update asu no  consolidation topic  amendments to the consolidation analysis  which is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships limited liability corporations and securitization structures collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations and mortgagebacked security transactions   the asu focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations public and private companies and notforprofit organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities   in addition to reducing the number of consolidation models from four to two the new standard simplifies the fasb accounting standards codification™ and improves current us gaap by   placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest a reporting organization may no longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances based solely on its fee arrangement when certain criteria are met   f         reducing the frequency of the application of relatedparty guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie   changing consolidation conclusions for public and private companies in several industries that typically make use of limited partnerships or vies   the asu will be effective for periods beginning after december   for public companies for private companies and notforprofit organizations the asu will be effective for annual periods beginning after december   and for interim periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period   the fasb has issued accounting standards update no  intangibles  goodwill and other  internaluse software subtopic  customer’s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement  existing gaap does not include explicit guidance about a customer’s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement examples of cloud computing arrangements include  a  software as a service  b  platform as a service  c  infrastructure as a service and  d  other similar hosting arrangements   the amendments add guidance to subtopic  intangibles  goodwill and other  internaluse software  which will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement the guidance already exists in the fasb accounting standards codification™  in paragraphs  through  but it is included in a subtopic applied by cloud service providers to determine whether an arrangement includes the sale or license of software   the amendments provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract the amendments do not change the accounting for a customer’s accounting for service contracts as a result of the amendments all software licenses within the scope of subtopic  will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets   for public business entities the amendments will be effective for annual periods including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december   for all other entities the amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods in annual periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted for all entities   an entity can elect to adopt

retrospective transition the disclosure requirements at transition include the requirements for prospective transition and quantitative information about the effects of the accounting change   the fasb has issued asu no  earnings per share topic  effects on historical earnings per unit of master limited partnership dropdown transactions  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force the amendments apply to master limited partnerships subject to the master limited partnerships subsections of topic  earnings per share  that receive net assets through a dropdown transaction     f         the amendments specify that for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the twoclass method the earnings losses of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner in that circumstance the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings losses differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the twoclass method also are required   current gaap does not contain guidance for master limited partnerships that specifies how historical earnings per unit should be affected when a dropdown transaction occurs that is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control   the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years earlier application is permitted the amendments should be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented   the fasb has issued accounting standards update  fair value measurement topic  disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  the amendments apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment using the net asset value per share or its equivalent practical expedient   topic  fair value measurement  permits a reporting entity as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of certain investments using the net asset value per share of the investment currently investments valued using the practical expedient are categorized within the fair value hierarchy on the basis of whether the investment is redeemable with the investee at net asset value on the measurement date never redeemable with the investee at net asset value or redeemable with the investee at net asset value at a future date for investments that are redeemable with the investee at a future date a reporting entity must consider the length of time until those investments become redeemable to determine the classification within the fair value hierarchy   the amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient the amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient rather those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient   the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years for all other entities the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years a reporting entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all periods presented the retrospective approach requires that an investment for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient be removed from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented in an entity’s financial statements earlier application is permitted   the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no  technical corrections and improvements  the amendments cover a wide range of topics in the fasb accounting standards codification ™ codification the amendments generally fall into one of the types of amendments listed below    amendments related to differences between original guidance and the codification these amendments arose because of differences between original guidance eg fasb statements eitf issues and so forth and the codification these amendments principally carry forward precodification guidance or subsequent amendments into the codification many times either the writing style or phrasing of the original guidance did not directly translate into the codification format and style as a result the meaning of the guidance might have been unintentionally altered alternatively amendments in this section may relate to guidance that was codified without some text references or phrasing that upon review was deemed important to the guidance     f         guidance clarification and reference corrections these amendments provide clarification through updating wording correcting references or a combination of both in most cases the feedback suggested that without these enhancements guidance may be misapplied or misinterpreted    simplification these amendments streamline or simplify the codification through minor structural changes to headings or minor editing of text to improve the usefulness and understandability of the codification    minor improvements these amendments improve the guidance and are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities   the amendments represent changes to clarify the codification correct unintended application of guidance or make minor improvements to the codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities in addition some of the amendments will make the codification easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies providing needed clarifications and improving the presentation of guidance in the codification   transition guidance varies based on the amendments the amendments that require transition guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those

update asu no  business combinations topic  simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments   us gaap currently requires that during the measurement period the acquirer retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill those adjustments are required when new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts initially recognized or would have resulted in the recognition of additional assets or liabilities the acquirer also must revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements as needed including revising depreciation amortization or other income effects as a result of changes made to provisional amounts   the amendments require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined the amendments require that the acquirer record in the same period’s financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects if any as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date   the amendments require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date   for public business entities the amendments are effective

the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures based upon their evaluation of those controls and procedures performed as of the end of the period covered by this report our principal executive and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that i information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit to the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and ii material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure   management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting   lim chun hoo our chief executive officer and chief financial officer responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af and df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that   a pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets b provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors and c provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   our chief executive and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december    in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in  internal control — integrated framework  a material weakness as defined by sec rules is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that were identified are   a we did not maintain sufficient personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge experience and training in the application of gaap commensurate with our complexity and our financial accounting and reporting requirements we have limited experience in the areas of financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures also we do not have an independent audit committee as a result there is a lack of monitoring of the financial reporting process and there is a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements including disclosures will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and   b due to our small size we do not have a proper segregation of duties in certain areas of our financial reporting process the areas where we have a lack of segregation of duties include cash receipts and disbursements approval of purchases and approval of accounts payable invoices for payment this control deficiency which is pervasive in nature results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   based on our assessment our chief executive and chief financial officer believes that as of december   our internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on those criteria            accordingly management believes based on its knowledge that  this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material face necessary to make the statements made not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report and  the financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the years and periods then ended   this report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting  management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the sec that permit us to provide only management’s report in this report   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended december   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   part iii   item  directors executive officers and corporate governance   the following table sets forth

and training in the application of gaap commensurate with our complexity and our financial accounting and reporting requirements we have limited experience in the areas of financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures also we do not have an independent audit committee as a result there is a lack of monitoring of the financial reporting process and there is a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements including disclosures will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and   b due to our small size we do not have a proper segregation of duties in certain areas of our financial reporting process the areas where we have a lack of segregation of duties include cash receipts and disbursements approval of purchases and approval of accounts payable invoices for payment this control deficiency which is pervasive in nature results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be
