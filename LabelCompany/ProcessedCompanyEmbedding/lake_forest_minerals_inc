following summary together with the more detailed business information and the financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report in this annual report unless the context otherwise denotes references to we us our the company lake forest and lake forest minerals are to lake forest minerals inc lake forest minerals was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   we are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history we have sold  in equity securities since inception  from the sale of  shares of stock to our officer and director and  from the sale of  shares registered pursuant to our s registration statement which became effective on august   the offering was completed on september   our financial statements from inception through the year ended june   report no revenues and a net loss of  seale and beers certified public accountants our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for lake forest minerals which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern effective june   the company entered into a mineral property option agreement with tl sadlierbrown whereby the company obtained an option to acquire the vin mineral claim located in the princeton mining division of british columbia under the terms of the agreement the company paid  by june   paid a further  by august   and in order to maintain the option was required to pay an additional  by june   upon completion of the required payments the company would have owned an undivided  interest in the vin mineral claim subject to a  net smelter returns royalty reserved in favour of the optionor prior to completing the payments required under the agreement the company had the right to conduct exploration and development activities on the property at its sole discretion and having provided notice to the vendor had the option to terminate the agreement and relieve itself from any obligations thereunder on february   the company provided notice to mr sadlierbrown and terminated the option agreement and relieved itself from any obligations thereunder our plan is to seek investigate and consummate a merger or other business combination purchase of assets or other strategic transaction ie a merger with a corporation partnership limited liability company or other operating business entity a merger target desiring the perceived advantages of becoming a publicly reporting and publicly held corporation we have no operating business and conduct minimal operations necessary to meet regulatory requirements our ability to commence any operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources we are currently considered a shell company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues do not own an operating business and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yettobe identified operating company or business we have no employees and no material assets we currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to combine the implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination andor the    successful sale of our securities we intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering any sales of equity securities or debt securities bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe has significant growth potential while we may under certain circumstances seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business unless additional financing is obtained we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations a common reason for a target company to enter into a merger with a shell company is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares such a company would hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself such as the time delays and significant expenses incurred to comply with the various federal and state securities law that regulate initial public offerings as a result of our limited resources unless and until additional financing is obtained we expect to have sufficient proceeds to effect only a single business combination accordingly the prospects for our success will be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses a target business may be dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products processes or services in which case there will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable our officer is only required to devote a small portion of his time to our affairs on a parttime or asneeded basis we expect to use outside consultants advisors attorneys and accountants as necessary none of which will be hired on a retainer basis we do not anticipate hiring any fulltime employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities we do not expect our present management to play any managerial role for us following a business combination although we intend to scrutinize closely the management of a prospective target business in connection with our evaluation of a business combination with a target business our assessment of management may be incorrect in evaluating a prospective target business we will consider several factors including the following  experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel of the target business  costs associated with effecting the business combination  equity interest retained by our stockholders in the merged entity  growth potential of the target business  capital requirements of the target business  capital available to the target business  stage of development of the target business  proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target business  the financial statements of the target business and  the regulatory environment in which the target business operates    the foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business will be based to the extent relevant on the above factors as well as other considerations we deem relevant in connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business we anticipate that we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass among other things meeting with incumbent management as well as a review of financial legal and other information the time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business including conducting a due diligence review and to structure and consummate the business combination including negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable corporate and securities laws cannot be determined at this time our president intends to devote only a very small portion of his time to our affairs and accordingly the consummation of a business combination may require a longer time than if he devoted his full time to our affairs however he will devote such time as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out our business and affairs the amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon among other things whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiation of a business combination we anticipate that various prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various sources including securities brokerdealers investment bankers venture capitalists bankers and other members of the financial community including possibly the executive officers and our affiliates various impediments to a business combination may arise such as appraisal rights afforded the stockholders of a target business under the laws of its state of organization this may prove to be deterrent to a particular combination bankruptcy or similar proceedings there has been no bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding reorganizations purchase or sale of assets there have been no material reclassifications mergers consolidations or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business patents trademarks franchises royalty agreements or labor contracts we have no current plans for any registrations such as patents trademarks copyrights franchises concessions royalty agreements or labor contracts we will assess the need for any copyright trademark or patent applications on an ongoing basis need for government approval of products or services we are not required to apply for or have any government approval for our products or services research and development costs during the last two years we have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception employees and employment agreements our only employee is our sole officer jeffrey taylor mr taylor currently devotes  hours per week to company matters and he will continue to devote as much time as the board of directors determines is necessary to manage the affairs of the company there are no formal employment agreements between the company and our current employee    reports to securities holders we provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders we make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the securities exchange act we are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing form k annually and form q quarterly in addition we will file form k and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required we do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the exchange act the public may read and copy any materials that we file with the securities and exchange commission sec at the secs public reference room at  f street ne washington dc  the public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at sec the sec maintains an internet site httpwwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following known risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this report in evaluating our company our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following known risks the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks not presently known to us may also impair our business operations we have no recent operating history or basis for evaluating prospects we currently have no operating business or plans to develop one we are seeking to enter into a merger or business combination with another operating company to date our efforts have been limited to meeting our regulatory filing requirements and searching for a merger target we have limited resources and no revenues from operations and will need additional financing in order to execute any business plan we have limited resources no revenues from operations to date and our cash on hand may not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements during the next twelve months in addition we will not achieve any revenues other than insignificant investment income until at the earliest the consummation of a merger and we cannot ascertain our capital requirements until such time there can be no assurance that determinations ultimately made by us will permit us to achieve our business objectives we will be able to effect at most one merger and thus may not have a diversified business our resources are limited and we will most likely have the ability to effect only a single merger this probable lack of diversification will subject us to numerous economic competitive and regulatory developments any or all of which may have a material adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to the consummation of a merger we will become dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products processes or services we depend substantially upon our president whose experience is limited to make all management decisions our ability to effect a merger will be dependent upon the efforts of our president jeffrey taylor notwithstanding the importance of mr taylor we have not entered into any employment agreement or other understanding with mr taylor    concerning compensation or obtained any key man life insurance on any of his life the loss of the services of mr taylor will have a material adverse effect on achieving our business objectives and success we will rely upon the expertise of mr taylor and do not anticipate that we will hire additional personnel there is competition for those private companies suitable for a merger transaction of the type contemplated by management we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination we are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities a large number of established and wellfinanced entities including small public companies and venture capital firms are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do consequently we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination these competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination future success is highly dependent on the ability of management to locate and attract a suitable acquisition the nature of our operations is highly speculative the success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations financial condition and management of the identified business opportunity while management intends to seek business combinations with entities having established operating histories we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating candidates meeting that criterion in the event we complete a business combination the success of our operations may be dependent upon management of the successor firm or venture partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our control we have no agreement for a business combination or other transaction we have no definitive agreement with respect to engaging in a merger with joint venture with or acquisition of a private or public entity no assurances can be given that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude a business combination we cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms and there is consequently a risk that funds allocated to the purchase of our shares will not be invested in a company with active business operations management will change upon the consummation of a merger after the closing of a merger or business combination it is likely our current management will not retain any control or managerial responsibilities upon such event mr taylor intends to resign from his positions with us current stockholders will be immediately and substantially diluted upon a merger or business combination our articles of incorporation authorized the issuance of  shares of common stock there are currently  authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance to the extent that additional shares of common stock are authorized and issued in connection with a merger or business    combination our stockholders could experience significant dilution of their respective ownership interests furthermore the issuance of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect prevailing market prices if any for the common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities control by existing stockholder mr taylor beneficially owns  of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result this stockholder is able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and the approval of mergers consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets our common stock is a penny stock which may restrict the ability of stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market the sec has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price as defined of less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions including an exception of an equity security that is quoted on a national securities exchange our common stock is not now quoted on a national exchange but is traded on finras otc bulletin board otcbb thus they are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell these securities for example the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser of such securities and have received the purchasers written consent to the transactions prior to the purchase additionally the rules require the delivery prior to the transaction of a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered underwriter and current quotations for the securities and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealers presumed control over the market finally among other requirements monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock and warrants in the secondary market liquidity is limited and we may be unable to obtain listing of our common stock on a more liquid market our common stock is quoted on the otc bulletin board otcbb which provides significantly less liquidity than a securities exchange such as the american or new york stock exchange or an automated quotation system such as the nasdaq global market or capital market there is uncertainty that we will ever be accepted for a listing on an automated quotation system or national securities exchange item b unresolved staff comments none item  properties we do not currently own any property the companys corporate documents are stored at the home of our president for no charge the telephone number is  the mailing address for the company is  s carson street suite  carson city nv  this is the address of our resident agent in nevada due to the companys limited capital resources and the nature of its business we determined this was the best arrangement for the company management believes the current arrangement is sufficient for its needs at this time    we currently have no investment policies as they pertain to real estate real estate interests or real estate mortgages item  legal proceedings we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or potential legal actions item  removed and reserved part ii item  market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities our shares are quoted on the overthecounter electronic bulletin board otcbb under the symbol lakf the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements per se to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority securities quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  or  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that we will continue to have the funds required to remain in compliance with our reporting obligations there has been no active trading of our securities and therefore no high and low bid pricing as of the date of this report lake forest minerals had shareholders of record we have paid no cash dividends and have no outstanding options penny stock rules the securities and exchange commission has also adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system a purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock our shares constitute penny stock under the securities and exchange act the shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future the classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a brokerdealer to sell the stock into a secondary market which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate hisher investment any brokerdealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to rules g through g of the securities and exchange act rather than creating a need to comply with those rules some brokerdealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document which     contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stock in both public offerings and secondary trading  contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities act of  as amended  contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including bid and ask price for the penny stock and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price  contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions  defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks and  contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the securities and exchange commission shall require by rule or regulation the brokerdealer also must provide prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock to the customer  the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock  the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction  the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and  monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement these disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities reports we are subject to certain filing requirements and will furnish annual financial reports to our stockholders certified by our independent accountant and will furnish unaudited quarterly financial reports in our quarterly reports filed electronically with the sec all reports and information filed by us can be found at the sec
