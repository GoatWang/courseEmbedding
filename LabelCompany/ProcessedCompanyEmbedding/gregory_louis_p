in charleston south carolina died july   in eliot maine was a prominent member of the baháí faith posthumously appointed a hand of the cause the highest appointed position in the baháí faith by shoghi effendi contents  early years  precollege  university and professional years  as a baháí  encountering the religion  first actions  pilgrimage    succeeding years of service  later years  notes  further reading  external links early yearsedit precollegeedit he was born on june   to africanamerican parents liberated during the civil war whose number included his future stepfather st sgt george gregory his mother was mary elizabeth whose mother mary was african and whose father was an enslaver named george washington dargan of the rough fork plantation in darlington south carolina when gregory was four years old his father ebaneezer george died at seven years of age louis was witness to the savage lynching of his grandfather who had taken the family in and who had succeeded in a blacksmith business then his mother remarried to george gregory who was the only freeman of african descent to join the union army from the  in charleston at the time george gregory rose to st sgt in the th united states colored troopsusct after being recruited by major delaney of african descent after the war he was honorifically called colonel gregory and his family received a civil war pension at this point louis george gregory took the name of his step father due to his military service his stepson louis george gregory was introduced in family situations to make friends with the european descent children of army officers who would visit the home george gregory was also a leader in the community playing a significant role in the interracial united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america that upon his death in  the union put out an advertisement in the charleston newspaperwhich asking all union members to attend  of both races did make it to monrovia union cemetery where headstones to george and mary elizabeth stand to this day during his elementary schooling gregory attended the first public school that was open to both african americans and whites in charleston south carolina george and mary elizabeth were desperate for a child together but after many infant deaths tragically mary elizabeth died in  after suffering an illness while giving birth to another infant death three months earlier to add to louis tragedy his older brother theodore also died the same year despite all of that at the avery institute the leading school for americans of african descent in charleston louis not only still graduated but gave the graduation speech entitled thou shalt not live for thyself alone avery institute still remembers louis george gregory to this day by prominently displaying his portrait in their preserved classroomcitation needed significantly at this point louis gained a step brother harrison gregory as his stepfather remarried lauretta gregory laurettas own husband civil war veteran louis noisette had died while she was pregnant with harrison the noisette family is a prominent charleston family that hails from haiti and may help explain why louis chose haiti as his future pioneering home in the s philippe stanislas noisette was the young son of a nantes france horticulturalist for the king of france and was sent to haiti to send back exotic flowers while there he married celestine a haitian of african descent they fled the violence of the haitian revolution to charleston sc together with two of celestines family members because of the miscegenation laws of south carolina philippe was forced to declare celestine a slave in order to continue to live together they had six children together in  there is a record of a refusal of his request to liberate one of the family members through manumissioncitation needed one of the two men fathered benjamin who became enslaved by the solomon family benjamins children recorded in a  deposition that throughout their enslavement their father made clear to them to remember their last name was noisette rather than that of their enslavercitation needed harrison escaped enslavement in  and joined the union navy on may   in port royal sc benjamin also escaped enslavement in  and went on to the freemans camp barker as it was known then in washington dc and finally louis stepbrothers father louis noisette remained enslaved until african american soldiers liberated charleston in february  he then joined the rd usct regiment as a drummer to help liberate his mother and sister who remained enslaved in savannah after the war louis noisette married lauretta and had the child harrison noisette who became harrison gregory university and professional yearsedit gregorys generous stepfather paid for his first year at fisk university in nashville tennessee where he studied english literature using the tailoring skills his mother had taught him he managed to manage the finances needed for the rest of his bachelors degree there being no law schools which would accept him in the south he continued on to howard university in washington dc one of the few universities to accept black graduate students to study law and received his llb degree in spring  he was admitted to the bar and along with another young lawyer james a cobb opened a law office in washington dc the partnership ended in  after gregory started to work in the united states department of the treasury in  gregory was listed as a supporter of the committee for a celebration of booker t washington in  gregory served as vice president of the howard university law school alumni association gregory had been attracted to the niagara movement and active in the bethel literary and historical society a negro organization devoted to discussing issues of the day  he had been elected a vice president in  and president in  meanwhile gregory was visible in the newspapers over racist incidents as a baháíedit encountering the religionedit at the treasury department gregory met thomas h gibbs with whom he formed a close relationship gibbs while not being a baháí himself shared information about the religion to gregory and gregory attended a lecture by lua getsinger a leading baháí in  in that meeting he met pauline hannen and her husband who invited him to many other meetings through the next couple of years and gregory was much affected by the behavior of the hannens and the religion after having become disillusioned with christianity among the readings gregory reviewed on the religion was an early edition of the hidden words and the meetings were also held among the poor at a school and a baháí view of christian scripture and prophecy much affected him and presented a framework for a reformulation of society while the hannens went on pilgrimage in  by visiting abdulbahá then head of the religion in palestine gregory left the treasury department and established his practice in washington dc when the hannens returned gregory once again started attending meetings on the religion and the burgeoning baháí community of dc was holding more and more meetings  particularly integrated meetings of the hannens and some others abdulbahá also began to communicate either in letters or to those that visited on pilgrimage a preference for integration on july   wrote to the hannens that he was an adherent of the baháí faith it comes to me that i have never taken occasion to thank you specifically for all your kindness and patience which finally culminated in my acceptance of the great truths of the baháí revelation it has given me an entirely new conception of christianity and of all religion and with it my whole nature seems changed for the betterit is a sane and practical religion which meets all the varying needs of life and i hope i shall ever regard it as a priceless possession first actionsedit at this point gregory started organizing meetings for the religion as well including one under the auspices of the bethel literary and historical society a negro organization of which he was president previously he also wrote to abdulbahá who responded to gregory that he had high expectations of gregory in the realm of race relations the hannens asked that gregory attend some organizational meetings to help consult on opportunities for the faith with such meetings the practical aspects of integration with some baháís became crystallized while for others it became a strain they had to work to overcome gregory received a letter in november  from abdulbahá saying i hope that thou mayest become… the means whereby the white and colored people shall close their eyes to racial differences and behold the reality of humanity that is the universal truth which is the oneness of the kingdom of the human race… rely as much as thou canst on the true one and be thou resigned to the will of god so that like unto a candle thou mayest be enkindled in the world of humanity and like unto a star thou mayest shine and gleam from the horizon of reality and become the cause of the guidance of both races in  gregory stopped working as a lawyer and began a long period of service holding meetings and traveling for the religion and wrote and lectured on the subject of racial unity some initial meetings were held in parallel among the races but abdulbahá made it known that the direction of the community was toward integrated meetings the fact that upper class white baháís repeatedly achieved steps towards integration was a confirmation to gregory of the power of the religion gregory still president of the bethel literary and historical society arranged for presentations by several baháís to the group gregory initiated a major trip through the south he travelled to richmond virginia durham north carolina and other locations in north carolina charleston south carolina the city of his family and childhood and macon georgia where he told people about the religion in charleston he is known to have presented talks at the carpenters union hall and made contact with a priest who had encountered the religion at green acre and met mirzá abulfadl in charleston an african american lawyer alonzo twine converted the first baháí of south carolina though gregorys stay was short and he didnt return to charleston for some years in the meantime unbeknownst to gregory twine was committed to a mental institution by his mother and family priest and where he died a few years later  still handing out baháí pamphlets he made himself gregory also began to participate more in the early baháí administration in february  he was elected to the washingtons working committee of the baháí assembly the first africanamerican to serve on that position pilgrimageedit on march   at the behest of abdulbahá gregory sailed from new york city through europe to egypt and palestine to go on pilgrimage in palestine gregory met with abdulbahá and shoghi effendi and visited the shrine of baháulláh and the shrine of the báb after he had returned to egypt from palestine the discussion of race unity in the united states came about with abdulbahá and the other pilgrims abdulbahá stated that there was no distinction between the races and then gave blackberries to each of the pilgrims which gregory interpreted as the symbolic sharing of blackcoloured fruit during this time abdulbahá also started encouraging gregory and louisa mathew a white englishwoman who was also a pilgrim to get to know each other after leaving egypt gregory travelled to germany before returning to the united states where he spoke at a number of gatherings to baháís and their friends when he returned to the united states he continued to travel mainly the southern united states talking about the baháí faith but elsewhere as well he held his first public meeting on the religion after his return to the states in february  and published his own article in the washington bee in november being inspired by the action of abdulbahá in britain when he was also first elected to a washington baháí working committee edit  was a momentous year for gregory in april he was elected to the national baháí executive board and assisted during abdulbahás visit to the united states during which he repeatedly emphasized the oneness of humanity and used blackcolored references for pictures of beauty and virtue see abdulbahás journeys to the west there are several prominent engagements where abdulbahá spoke thanks to the efforts of gregory the first was on  april  when abdulbahá attended several events first he spoke at howard university to over  students faculty administrators and visitors — an event commemorated in  then he attended a reception by the persian chargdeaffairs and the turkish ambassador at this reception abdulbahá moved the placenames such that the only africanamerican present gregory was seated at the head of the table next to himself then abdulbahá spoke at bethel literary and historical society where gregory had a long history including being president later in june abdulbahá addressed the naacp national convention in chicago  and reported by w e b du bois in the crisis louis g and louisa mathew gregory on september   gregory and louisa mathew married becoming the first baháí interracial couple during his travels whenever he was accompanied by his wife they received a range of different reactions because interracial marriage was illegal or unrecognized in a majority of the states at that time succeeding years of serviceedit the struggle of the washington baháí community where the gregories lived towards fully and only integrated meetings and institutions came about in spring  that summer abdulbahás earliest tablets of the divine plan arrived the tablet for the south arrived to joseph hannen with whom gregory worked on a committee by december gregory had traveled among  of the  southern states named mostly speaking to student audiences and began a second round in  complementing gregorys priorities was the founding of naacp organizations in south carolina starting in  though the kkk activities increased the pace of lynchings many of the initial organizers of the naacp were personally known to gregory in  after the remaining letters of the abdulbahá arrived and used the example of st gregory the illuminator as the model of effort in the spread of the religion hannen and gregory were subsequently elected to a committee focused on the american south and gregory focused on two approaches  presenting the religions teachings on race issue to social leaders as well as to the general public  and initiated his next more extensive trip from  to  often with roy williams an africanamerican baháí from new york city during  a pilgrim returned from seeing abdulbahá with a focus on initiating conferences on race issues called race amity conferences and gregory consulted by letter on how to begin the first one was held may  in washington dc among the contacts in south carolina gregory made was josiah morse of the university of south carolina as a result several baháís speakers would be known at university based events starting in the s gregory developed a friendship with samuel chiles mitchell president of the university of south carolina – and shared that abdulbahás views he heard at the lake mohonk conference on international arbitration affected him in his interracial work into the s in addition to supportful connections there was also increasing opposition gregorys january  appearance in columbia sc registered africanamerican ministers who warned of his presence and the dangers of his religion though others positively invited gregory to speak one of the ministers who opposed him was the selfsame minister who assisted in committing the first declared baháí in south carolina to an institution for the mentally insane gregory was then the

grandfather who had taken the family in and who had succeeded in a blacksmith business then his mother remarried to george gregory who was the only freeman of african descent to join the union army from the  in charleston at the time george gregory rose to st sgt in the th united states colored troopsusct after being recruited by major delaney of african descent after the war he was honorifically called colonel gregory and his family received a civil war pension at this point louis george gregory took the name of his step father due to his military service his stepson louis

gained a step brother harrison gregory as his stepfather remarried lauretta gregory laurettas own husband civil war veteran louis noisette had died while she was pregnant with harrison the noisette family is a prominent charleston family that hails from haiti and may help explain why louis chose haiti as his future pioneering home in the s philippe stanislas noisette was the young son of a nantes france horticulturalist for the king of france and was sent to haiti to send back exotic flowers while there he married celestine a haitian of african descent they fled the violence of the

continue to live together they had six children together in  there is a record of a refusal of his request to liberate one of the family members through manumissioncitation needed one of the two men fathered benjamin who became enslaved by the solomon family benjamins children recorded in a  deposition that throughout their enslavement their father made clear to them to remember their last name was noisette rather than that of their enslavercitation needed harrison escaped enslavement in  and joined the union navy on may   in port royal sc benjamin also escaped enslavement in  and went on to the freemans camp barker as it was known then in washington dc and finally louis stepbrothers father louis noisette remained enslaved until african american soldiers liberated charleston in february

literature using the tailoring skills his mother had taught him he managed to manage the finances needed for the rest of his bachelors degree there being no law schools which would accept him in the south he continued on to howard university in washington dc one of the few universities to accept black graduate students to study law and received his llb degree in spring  he was admitted to the bar and along with another young lawyer james a cobb opened a law office in washington dc the partnership ended in  after gregory started to work in the united states department of the treasury in  gregory was listed as a supporter of the committee for a celebration of booker t washington in  gregory served as vice president of the howard university law school alumni association gregory had been attracted to the niagara movement and active in the bethel literary and historical society a negro organization devoted to discussing issues of the day  he had been elected a vice president in  and president in  meanwhile gregory was visible in the newspapers over racist incidents as a baháíedit encountering the religionedit at the treasury department gregory met thomas h gibbs with whom he formed a close relationship gibbs while not being a baháí himself shared information about the religion to gregory and gregory attended a lecture by lua getsinger a leading baháí in  in that meeting he met pauline hannen and her husband who invited him to many other meetings through the next couple of years and gregory was much affected by the behavior of the hannens and the religion after having become disillusioned with christianity among the readings gregory reviewed on the religion was an early edition of the hidden words and the meetings were also held among the poor at a school and a baháí view of christian scripture and prophecy much affected him and presented a framework for a reformulation of society while the hannens went on pilgrimage in  by visiting abdulbahá then head of the religion in palestine gregory left the treasury department and established his practice in washington dc when the hannens returned gregory once again started attending meetings on the religion and the burgeoning baháí community of dc was holding more and more meetings  particularly integrated meetings of the hannens and some others abdulbahá also began to communicate either in letters or to those that visited on pilgrimage a preference for integration on july   wrote to the hannens that he was an adherent of the baháí faith it comes to me that i have never taken occasion to thank you specifically for all your kindness and patience which finally culminated in my acceptance of the great truths of the baháí revelation it has given me an entirely new conception of christianity and of all religion and with it my whole nature seems changed for the betterit is a sane and practical religion which meets all the varying needs of life and i hope i shall ever regard it as a priceless possession first actionsedit at this point gregory started organizing meetings for the religion as well including one under the auspices of the bethel literary and historical society a negro organization of which he was president previously he also wrote to abdulbahá who responded to gregory that he had high expectations of gregory in the realm of race relations the hannens asked that gregory attend some organizational meetings to help consult on opportunities for the faith with such meetings the practical aspects of integration with some baháís became crystallized while for others it became a strain they had to work to overcome gregory received a letter in november  from abdulbahá saying i hope that thou mayest become… the means whereby the white and colored people shall close their eyes to racial differences and behold the reality of humanity that is the universal truth which is the oneness of the kingdom of the human race… rely as much as thou canst on the true one and be thou resigned to the will of god so that like unto a candle thou mayest be enkindled in the world of humanity and like unto a star thou mayest shine and gleam from the horizon of reality and become the cause of the guidance of both races in  gregory stopped working as a lawyer and began a long period of service holding meetings and traveling for the religion and wrote and lectured on the subject of racial unity some initial meetings were held in parallel among the races but abdulbahá made it known that the direction of the community was toward integrated meetings the fact that upper class white baháís repeatedly achieved steps towards integration was a confirmation to gregory of the power of the religion gregory still president of the bethel literary and historical society arranged for presentations by several baháís to the group gregory initiated a major trip through the south he travelled to richmond virginia durham north carolina and other locations in north carolina charleston south carolina the city of his family and childhood and macon georgia where he told people about the religion in charleston he is known to have presented talks at the carpenters union hall and made contact with a priest who had encountered the religion at green acre and met mirzá abulfadl in charleston an african american lawyer alonzo twine converted the first baháí of south carolina though gregorys stay was short and he didnt return to charleston for some years in the meantime unbeknownst to gregory twine was committed to a mental institution by his mother and family priest and where he died a few years later  still handing out baháí pamphlets he made himself gregory also began to participate more in the early baháí administration in february  he was elected to the washingtons working committee of the baháí assembly the first africanamerican to serve on that position pilgrimageedit on march   at the behest of abdulbahá gregory sailed from new york city through europe to egypt and palestine to go on pilgrimage in palestine gregory met with abdulbahá and shoghi effendi and visited the shrine of baháulláh and the shrine of the báb after he had returned to egypt from palestine the discussion of race unity in the united states came about with abdulbahá and the other pilgrims abdulbahá stated that there was no distinction between the races and then gave blackberries to each of the pilgrims which gregory interpreted as the symbolic sharing of blackcoloured fruit during this time abdulbahá also started encouraging gregory and louisa mathew a white englishwoman who was also a pilgrim to get to know each other after leaving egypt gregory travelled to germany before returning to the united states where he spoke at a number of gatherings to baháís and their friends when he returned to the united states he continued to travel mainly the southern united states talking about the baháí faith but elsewhere as well he held his first public meeting on the religion after his return to the states in february  and published his own article in the washington bee in november being inspired by the action of abdulbahá in britain when he was also first elected to a washington baháí working committee edit  was a momentous year for gregory in april he was elected to the national baháí executive board and assisted during abdulbahás visit to the united states during which he repeatedly emphasized the oneness of humanity and used blackcolored references for pictures of beauty and virtue see abdulbahás journeys to the west there are several prominent engagements where abdulbahá spoke thanks to the efforts of gregory the first was on  april  when abdulbahá attended several events first he spoke at howard university to over  students faculty administrators and visitors — an event commemorated in  then he attended a reception by the persian chargdeaffairs and the turkish ambassador at this reception abdulbahá moved the placenames such that the only africanamerican present gregory was seated at the head of the table next to himself then abdulbahá spoke at bethel literary and historical society where gregory had a long history including being president later in june abdulbahá addressed the naacp national convention in chicago  and reported by w e b du bois in the crisis louis g and louisa mathew gregory on september   gregory and louisa mathew married becoming the first baháí interracial couple during his travels whenever he was accompanied by his wife they received a range of different reactions because interracial marriage was illegal or unrecognized in a majority of the states at that time succeeding years of serviceedit the struggle of the washington baháí community where the gregories lived towards fully and only integrated meetings and institutions came about in spring  that summer abdulbahás earliest tablets of the divine plan arrived the tablet for the south arrived to joseph hannen with whom gregory worked on a committee by december gregory had traveled among  of the  southern states named mostly speaking to student audiences and began a second round in  complementing gregorys priorities was the founding of naacp organizations in south carolina starting in  though the kkk activities increased the pace of lynchings many of the initial organizers of the naacp were personally known to gregory in  after the remaining letters of the abdulbahá arrived and used the example of st gregory the illuminator as the model of effort in the spread of the religion hannen and gregory were subsequently elected to a committee focused on the american south and gregory focused on two approaches  presenting the religions teachings on race issue to social leaders as well as to the general public  and initiated his next more extensive trip from  to  often with roy williams an africanamerican baháí from new york city during  a pilgrim returned from seeing abdulbahá with a focus on initiating conferences on race issues called race amity conferences and gregory consulted by letter on how to begin the first one was held may  in washington dc among the contacts in south carolina gregory made

dangers of his religion though others positively invited gregory to speak one of the ministers who opposed him was the selfsame minister who assisted in committing the first declared baháí in south

had died while she was pregnant with harrison the noisette family is a prominent charleston family that hails from haiti and may help explain why louis chose haiti as his future pioneering home in the

in nashville tennessee where he studied english literature using the tailoring skills his mother had taught him he managed to manage the finances needed for the rest of his bachelors degree there being no law schools which would accept him in the south he continued on to howard university in washington dc one of the few universities to accept black graduate students to study law and received his llb degree in spring  he was admitted to the bar and along with another young lawyer james a cobb opened a law office in washington dc the partnership ended in  after gregory started to work in the united states department of the treasury in  gregory was listed as a supporter of the committee for a celebration of booker t washington in  gregory served as vice president of the howard university law school alumni association gregory had been attracted to the niagara movement and active in the bethel literary and historical society a negro organization devoted to discussing issues of the day  he had been elected a vice president in  and president in  meanwhile gregory was visible in the newspapers over racist incidents as a baháíedit encountering the religionedit at the treasury department gregory met thomas h gibbs with whom he formed a close relationship gibbs while not being a baháí himself shared information about the religion to gregory and gregory attended a lecture by lua getsinger a leading baháí in  in that meeting he met pauline hannen and her husband who invited him to many other meetings through the next couple of years and gregory was much affected by the behavior of the hannens and the religion after having become disillusioned with christianity among the readings gregory reviewed on the religion was an early edition of the hidden words and the meetings were also held among the poor at a school and a baháí view of christian scripture and prophecy much affected him and presented a framework for a reformulation of society while the hannens went on pilgrimage in  by visiting abdulbahá then head of the religion in palestine gregory left the treasury department and established his practice in washington dc when the hannens returned gregory once again started attending meetings on the religion and the burgeoning baháí community of dc was holding more and more meetings  particularly integrated meetings of the hannens and some others abdulbahá also began to communicate either in letters or to those that visited on pilgrimage a preference for integration on july   wrote to the hannens that he was an adherent of the baháí faith it comes to me that i have never taken occasion to thank you specifically for all your kindness and patience which finally culminated in my acceptance of the great truths of the baháí revelation it has given me an entirely new conception of christianity and of all religion and with it my whole nature seems changed for the betterit is a sane and practical religion which meets all the varying needs of life and i hope i shall ever regard it as a priceless possession first actionsedit at this point gregory started organizing meetings for the religion as well including one under the auspices of the bethel literary and historical society a negro organization of which he was president previously he also wrote to abdulbahá who responded to gregory that he had high expectations of gregory in the realm of race relations the hannens asked that gregory attend some organizational meetings to help consult on opportunities for the faith with such meetings the practical aspects of integration with some baháís became crystallized while for others it became a strain they had to work to overcome gregory received a letter in november  from abdulbahá saying i hope that thou mayest become… the means whereby the white and colored people shall close their eyes to racial differences and behold the reality of humanity that is the universal truth which is the oneness of the kingdom of the human race… rely as much as thou canst on the true one and be thou resigned to the will of god so that like unto a candle thou mayest be enkindled in the world of humanity and like unto a star thou mayest shine and gleam from the horizon of reality and become the cause of the guidance of both races in  gregory stopped working as a lawyer and began a long period of service holding meetings and traveling for the religion and wrote and lectured on the subject of racial unity some initial meetings were held in parallel among the races but abdulbahá made it known that the direction of the community was toward integrated meetings the fact that upper class white baháís repeatedly achieved steps towards integration was a confirmation to gregory of the power of the religion gregory still president of the bethel literary and historical society arranged for presentations by several baháís to the group gregory initiated a major trip through the south he travelled to richmond virginia durham north carolina and other locations in north carolina charleston south carolina the city of his family and childhood and macon georgia where he told people about the religion in charleston he is known to have presented talks at the carpenters union hall and made contact with a priest who had encountered the religion at green acre and met mirzá abulfadl in charleston an african american lawyer alonzo twine converted the first baháí of south carolina though gregorys stay was short and he didnt return to charleston for some years in the meantime unbeknownst to gregory twine was committed to a mental institution by his mother and family priest and where he died a few years later  still handing out baháí pamphlets he made himself gregory also began to participate more in the early baháí administration in february  he was elected to the washingtons working committee of the baháí assembly the first africanamerican to serve on that position pilgrimageedit on march   at the behest of abdulbahá gregory sailed from new york city through europe to egypt and palestine to go on pilgrimage in palestine gregory met with abdulbahá and shoghi effendi and visited the shrine of baháulláh and the shrine of the báb after he had returned to egypt from palestine the discussion of race unity in the united states came about with abdulbahá and the other pilgrims abdulbahá stated that there was no distinction between the races and then gave blackberries to each of the pilgrims which gregory interpreted as the symbolic sharing of blackcoloured fruit during this time abdulbahá also started encouraging gregory and louisa mathew a white englishwoman who was also a pilgrim to get to know each other after leaving egypt gregory travelled to germany before returning to the united states where he spoke at a number of gatherings to baháís and their friends when he returned to the united states he continued to travel mainly the southern united states talking about the baháí faith but elsewhere as well he held his first public meeting on the religion after his return to the states in february  and published his own article in the washington bee in november being inspired by the action of abdulbahá in britain when he was also first elected to a washington baháí working committee edit  was a momentous year for gregory in april he was elected to the national baháí executive board and assisted during abdulbahás visit to the united states during which he repeatedly emphasized the oneness of humanity and used blackcolored references for pictures of beauty and virtue see abdulbahás journeys to the west there are several prominent engagements where abdulbahá spoke thanks to the efforts of gregory the first was on  april  when abdulbahá attended several events first he

louis g and louisa mathew gregory on september   gregory and louisa mathew married becoming the first baháí interracial couple during his travels whenever he was accompanied by his wife they received a range of different reactions because interracial marriage was illegal or unrecognized in a majority of the states at that time succeeding years of serviceedit the struggle of the washington baháí community where the gregories lived towards fully and only integrated meetings and institutions came about in spring  that summer abdulbahás earliest tablets of the divine plan arrived the tablet for the south arrived to joseph hannen with whom gregory worked on a committee by december gregory had traveled among  of the  southern states named mostly speaking to student audiences and began a second round in  complementing gregorys priorities was the founding of naacp organizations in south carolina starting in  though the kkk activities increased the pace of lynchings many of the initial organizers of the naacp were personally known to gregory in  after the remaining letters of the abdulbahá arrived and used the example of st gregory the illuminator as the model of effort in the spread of the religion hannen and gregory were subsequently elected to a committee focused on the american south and gregory focused on two approaches  presenting the religions teachings on race issue to social leaders as well as to the general public  and initiated his next more extensive trip from  to  often with roy williams an africanamerican baháí from new york city during  a pilgrim returned
