overseas research office in geneva followed in  in  jon lovelace jr introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager he divided each portfolio among several managers each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio known today as the capital system it avoids the phenomenon of creating singlemanager “stars” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave in the mids capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas capital group’s longterm approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms in the late s the firm was criticized for not offering thenpopular tech funds but when the tech bubble burst capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon in the early s new share classes and offerings were introduced such as a  college savings plan and retirement target date funds named for the expected year of withdrawal the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixedincome holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement today capital group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the us to include europe canada and asia and

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
