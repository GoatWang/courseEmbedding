stocks to buy include sdrl bcei pes wti and emes jul    am edt    by  zacks investment research     these  energy stocks are bargain investments now as the hope of a crude oil recovery in q makes them stocks to buy at great discounts last year energy stocks were the strongest sp sector performer with a marketthumping  return in particular november’s historic opecled production cut deal to alleviate a supple glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important  per barrel threshold the commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better the seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for  with the oil industry finally hoping that ‘this would be the year’ true to the strong sentiments us oil prices reached around  per barrel in late february the highest level in  months however the situation is drastically different now with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks by june  crude had cratered more than  from its february highs and officially plunged into bear territory in fact prices ended down  for the first half of the year – the worst performance since  apparently there was one small thing that the bullish speculators didn’t account for – the spectacular boom in us shale production arguably the biggest development in global oil markets over the last few years the relentless increase in north american shale output has undermined efforts by opec and other major producers to ‘rebalance’ the market and prop up prices apart from the muchdiscussed shale production issue there are some other reasons as well why oil markets remain oversupplied at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of us shaledriven production now at a financial equilibrium the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work throughout the downturn producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock and they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques with these efforts many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  oil reality and even thrive at those prices in other words while opec’s moves to trim output and rebalance the demandsupply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more as per eia’s latest inventory release crude production over the last  weeks averaged about  million barrels per day up  from the same week period last year the extension of supply curbs by top producers led by opec also disappointed markets at a meeting in vienna in may the cartel plus nonmembers led by russia decided to roll over their output cuts of  million barrels per day bpd to reduce global oil inventories until mar  the move though widely expected spooked some oil market investors who hoped that the cuts would be deepenedlengthened further meanwhile the producer cartel pumped more oil last month than in may – the second successive monthly rise in  – on increasing output from nigeria and libya which are exempt from the deal the production boost offset improved compliance by other members it’s quite clearly evident that the outputcap agreement spearheaded by opec has failed to achieve its stated goal of bringing global crude stockpiles down to fiveyear averages even the various energymonitoring bodies – eia iea and opec – have of late projected that us crude production will continue to ramp up through  thereby leading to slowerthanexpected market rebalancing to sum it up oil’s future direction will depend on the battle between the opecled output cuts and the increase in us shale production but as of now it seems that the ‘lower for longer’ oil is there to stay well into next year a rebound for energy stocks in the cards some analysts believe that oil prices have bottomed out following the recent selloff while a significant rebound is out of question due to the lingering supplydemand imbalance one could expect some shortterm price gains investors have pinned hopes of crude recovery over the latest us energy department’s inventory release that showed a fall in domestic oil production and a reduction in the us rig count number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country for the first time in  months – both pointing to a slowdown in shale output yes production is still climbing but growth might have tempered according to the us energy information administration eia domestic crude volumes have declined thrice in the last  weeks per the most recent report us output decreased  barrels per day – the largest fall since july  as a proof crude inventories have tumbled over  million barrels during the past  months and with it the pace of new rig addition has slowed down as well even as we cannot run down the chances of the market moving sideways and seeing high volatility many analysts are not too bearish about oil in the remainder of  if investors are eager to lap up opportunities in this notoriously volatile market a prudent move would be to buy the beatendown stocks with encouraging
