package delivery quickly shipping items where they need to go is another convenience of modern life that is easy to take for granted playing a pivotal role in any of these innovations would mark a highly successful career and that makes james l barksdales achievements even more extraordinary he was deeply involved in all three when fedex corp created the business of overnight mail delivery he oversaw the development of the first computer system capable of tracking millions of packages worldwide years before everyone had cellphones he was the president of mccaw cellular communications inc the company that became att wireless where he was ceo and as the general public first learned to use the internet he oversaw the meteoric rise of webbrowsing pioneer netscape fortune magazine has
