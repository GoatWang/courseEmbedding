gained about  handily topping the  advance of the benchmark sp ® index the investment environment this quarter generally supported the fastergrowing best of breed companies we prefer continued synchronized expansion in global activity provided a steady backdrop for equities with flagging oil prices and muted inflation mitigating any concerns about potential overheating for a second consecutive quarter growthoriented and largecap stocks outpaced other us equity categories most us equity sectors posted a positive return this quarter several cyclical sectors outperformed – including industrials financials information technology and materials – but the best performer was the health care sector a typically defensive group energy stocks continued to struggle amid declining crude oil prices while price competition weighed on telecommunication services stocks against this backdrop the funds outperformance of the benchmark was primarily driven by stock picks and a considerable overweighting in technology where we had a sizable longterm commitment that represented  of assets at quarter end notable contributors from tech included google parent alphabet the funds largest holding combining its class a and class c shares the stock gained about  the past three months reaching a series of new highs after the internet search leaders april announcement of strong quarterly financial results that were driven by revenue from search ads display ads and advertising on youtube videos also within tech shares of gaming and entertainment company activision blizzard gained roughly  this quarter activision is best known for its video game franchises call of duty world of warcraft and candy crush saga among others in early may the firm announced that it topped its targets for quarterly sales and earnings and also raised its financial forecast for the full year activision blizzard specifically cited the success of its new franchise overwatch reporting that it has more than  million users globally it remained a sizable holding reflecting our view that the company has improved monetization of its franchises the funds top individual contributor was a nonbenchmark stake in tesla as the maker of electric cars saw its stock rise  the past three months the soontobereleased massmarket model  – with a starting price of  – enjoyed phenomenal attention and demand with a reported plus preorders well beyond comparable models from bmw or mercedesbenz indeed some investors worried whether the model  electric vehicle was too good with potential to cannibalize sales from teslas moreexpensive models also teslas auto business continued to suffer production delays related to batteryproduction bottlenecks elsewhere online retailer amazoncom was a notable contributor while the firm is categorized as a retailer it too is exactly the type of tech company we seek and was a sizable holding the stock gained  this quarter rising steadily until cooling off beginning in early june as part of a broader selloff among technology stocks conversely our largest detractor was tjx companies shares of the owneroperator of discount chains tj maxx and marshalls returned about  this quarter the stock began to fall in anticipation of the firms midmay quarterly earnings report – which disappointed overall including comparablestore sales – and trended lower through june  in industrials the funds nonbenchmark stake in hd supply holdings returned about  this quarter the construction and industrial equipment provider missed profits estimates for the first quarter and announced earnings guidance for the second quarter that fell considerably below some analysts estimates which hurt the stock price and prompted us to reduce our position lastly untimely ownership of fastfood retailer mcdonalds hurt as we decided to establish an underweighted position in april serving breakfast all day has been good for the firm apparently as this change

even compared with the relatively calm levels of the past five years the steady economic backdrop combined with ample global monetary accommodation supported a relatively tranquil environment the us economy remains in mature expansion but it has continued to exhibit some healthy flavors of midcycle growth on the back of the synchronized global expansion manufacturing activity has reaccelerated and become more broadbased over the past year boosted by strengthening global demand and improved sales activity in the foreign sector corporate earnings are still inflecting positively in  as the continued global expansion supports manufacturing sectors and higher yearoveryear oil prices drive renewed energy sector profitability firming inflation and global growth have given the us federal reserve confidence to continue gradually hiking its shortterm policy rate although the environment remains weaker than during prior periods of fed tightening in this environment we plan to continue to focus on firms with improving growth prospects that seem overlooked by the market we prefer faster growers and the portfolio is positioned for an environment in which earnings growth is a prominent driver of stock performance our exposure to tech was largely unchanged this quarter and it remained by far the funds largest sector allocation in both absolute and relative terms we continue to believe many top companies here have the potential for significant growth the fund emphasizes what we consider to be franchise companies in technology these include alphabet and amazon both mentioned earlier along with consumer electronics maker apple and socialmedia company facebook the latter of which was a top contributor the past three months we believe these firms could continue to grow revenues from online advertising as consumers search the web more often from their smartphones if economic growth continues under a probusiness trump administration interest rates should continue to
