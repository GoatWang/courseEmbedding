call during today’s presentation all parties will be in a listen only mode following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions operator instructions now i’d like to turn the conference over to mr lasse glassen of the financial relations board lasse glassen thanks for joining us to discuss aehr test systems’ results for the third quarter of fiscal  by now you should have all received a copy of today’s press release if not you can call my office at area code  and we’ll get you a copy right away with us today from aehr test are rhea posedel chairman and chief executive officer and gary larson vice president of finance and chief financial officer management will review its operating performance for the quarter before opening the call to your questions now i’d like to turn the call over to gary larson gary l larson before we begin i’d like to make a few comments about forwardlooking statements please be advised that during the course of our discussion today we may make forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to projections regarding industry growth and customer demand for aehr test product as well as projections regarding aehr test’s future financial performance actual results may differ materially from projected results and should not be considered as an indication of future performance these risks and uncertainties include without limitation world economic conditions the timing of the recovery of the semiconductor equipment market acceptance by customer of aehr test’s technologies acceptance by customers of the systems shipped upon receipt of a purchase order the ability of new products to meet customer needs or performance described the company’s development manufacture and marketing of a commercially successful wafer level test and burn in system and the potential emergency of alternative technologies each of which could adversely affect demand for aehr test’s products in calendar year  we refer you to our most recent k and q reports and other reports from timetotime filed with the us securities  exchange commission for a more detailed description of the risks facing our business and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results the company disclaims any obligation to update our information contained in any forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this conference call now i’d like to introduce our chairman and ceo rhea posedel rhea j posedel welcome to our conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year  before i start i just wanted to mention that in case the quality of the call is bad i’m calling from texas i’m down here visiting on some potential customers i hope i’m pleased to report that pro forma revenue for the third quarter was  million up  on a sequential quarter basis on a gaap basis our revenue for the third quarter was  million with a net profit of  million the gaap numbers includes the sale of the remainder of our spansion us bankruptcy claim primarily related to the cancelation of wafer pack orders that were mostly built i would like to point out that our  million in revenues do not include the acceptance of the fox system we shipped to micronas in our second quarter even though the system is running production wafers the customer has not completed the formal acceptance process we are now planning to receive customer acceptance and recognize revenue for the fox during our fiscal fourth quarter there are several highlights from this past quarter that i’d like to bring to your attention we are most excited about winning a production order for abts burnin system from a major japanese integrated device manufacturer this customer ordered a specially configured abts optimized for burnin and testing of their high end micro controllers in addition the abts will be designed to include a burnin board automation which integrates in to their factory automation the first order was for a single system however we hope to receive follow on production orders starting in our next fiscal year this is an important order for aehr test for a couple of reasons first it’s a major accomplishment to win a production burnin system order in a country where large ic manufacturers generally buy from local suppliers in addition we believe this order further validates the performance capabilities of the abts platform and is evidence that it can be a cost effective production tool for packaged part burnin test of logic devices another highlight was the announcement today of a maxi burnin system to a second major japanese integrated device manufacturer for burnin of logic devices with individual temperature control per device if our first installation goes successfully we think we could receive follow on production orders in a few quarters this is another major account win for us and lays the foundation for growing our business over the next few quarters also during the third quarter we shipped over  million in fox system upgrades to spansion we believe these fox shipments are significant because they indicated that spansion is investing in our fox solution for full wafer test in a single touch down for their austin fab we are hopeful that we will receive additional wafer pack orders as their business expands over the next few quarters we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see for the abts product family this coming year the quoting activity the past few months has been high for burnin of low to high power logic ics including those requiring individual temperature control per device we believe the abts system offers cost savings and performance advantages that will allow us to penetrate and expanding share in this growing market segment for medium to high power logic burnin above  watts per device while we continue to aggressively market our fox full wafer parallel tester and fox wafer level burnin systems we do not have new orders to report at this time however we are making inroads in to a number of accounts where we’re seeing interest levels for a variety of applications such as sensors automotive ics mims just to name a few capital is still tight particularly in the automotive sector but we are hopeful to convert some of these prospects to orders we believe that over time over the long term more multi chip module stack dye and d packaging producers will need known good dye solutions to produce high yielding modules our strategy continues to be focused on penetrating as many production accounts as possible with our new abts and fox products this will allow us to expand our customer base and grow market share since our last conference call we’ve penetrated two japanese idms and we’re confident in our ability to expand our customer base and achieve our growth objectives because we have the strongest competitive product portfolio in our history with our fox and abts platforms we will be increasing our rd over the next few quarters to accelerate new product development initiatives which we expect will help the company win additional new accounts as business returns to more normal levels in closing we believe aehr test is in a favorable position to grow market share during this recovery period enabling us to return to a growth trajectory over the next few years we have exciting technology with our fox full wafer test and burnin systems and wafer pack contactors we feel confident that we can continue to win additional new accounts with our abts products which address growing market segments for high power logic burnin and memory applications in asia now i’d like to turn the call over to gary and he’ll discuss the third quarter financials in more detail gary l larson as rhea mentioned net sales were  million in the third quarter of fiscal  this compares to  million in the same quarter last year in the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold the remainder of its spansion us bankruptcy claim for net proceeds of approximately  million which resulted in the recording of  million as revenue related to cancellation chares  million as deferred revenue and  million as a reduction of operating expenses excluding the impact of the sale of the spansion claim fiscal  third quarter product sales were  million this compares to net sales of  million in the same quarter last year the increase was the result of the high level of net sales of the company’s wafer level products gross profit was  million for the third quarter of fiscal  or  of net sales this included  million in gross profit related to the spansion bankruptcy claim in the third quarter last year the company recorded a gross loss of  million which included a  million provision for excess and obsolete inventory reserves that were primarily taken as a result of spansion’s bankruptcy sga was  million for the third quarter of fiscal  this compares to  million in the prior year period which included a  million provision for bad debt due to the spansion bankruptcy third quarter  rd expense was  million compared with  million in the third quarter of last year rd spending varies from quartertoquarter depending on the level of development of new product as i noted earlier fiscal  third quarter operating expense was also reduced by ths of  million as a result of the sale of the remainder of the spansion claim net income in the third quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared with a net loss of  million or  per diluted share a year ago pro forma net loss in the third quarter of fiscal  was  million or  per diluted share compared with a pro forma net loss of  million or  per diluted share in the same period of the prior year in determining the pro forma or nongaap net loss in the third quarter of  we’ve excluded the gain on the sale of the spansion bankruptcy claim of  million and noncash stock compensation expenses of  million turning to the balance sheet our cash and cash equivalent increased to  million at february   from  million at november   the increase was primarily due to the  million in cash received in january  from the sale of the remainder of the spansion bankruptcy claim to a third party we continue to remain debt free this concludes our prepared remarks we are now ready to answer your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from jeffrey scott – scott asset management jeffrey scott – scott asset management gary can you break down the  million in sales you said  million was spansion upgrades typically  or so is service and spares what was the rest gary l larson we don’t generally give a detailed breakdown of our sales but we thought it was important to mention the spansion upgrades because all of those were written off materials so basically those items has full  margin on them jeffrey scott – scott asset management was the rest the max equipment gary l larson again we don’t generally give the full breakdown of the revenue rhea j posedel there were spares i believe we did sell a max to a local us company jeffrey scott – scott asset management what will it take for micronas to accept the fox what further demonstration do they need rhea j posedel they’re running it in production it’s one of these things where they need to take the system down to let us do some things and it’s basically just a timing they don’t want to give up the system it’s more of that than anything so it’s very little that has to be done so it’s just a matter of fitting in to their production schedule hopefully we’re going to do that this quarter jeffrey scott – scott asset management do they owe you any more cash for it gary l larson yes they owe  of the selling price jeffrey scott – scott asset management so you have received  in cash already gary l larson that’s correct jeffrey scott – scott asset management what are you hearing about spansion japan rhea j posedel i know it’s an excellent question and we’re always staying on top of that and as far as we’re hearing they’re not running wafers it looks like they’re trying to sell off their equipment jeffrey scott – scott asset management how many fox machines are at spansion japan rhea j posedel  jeffrey scott – scott asset management and what will happen to them rhea j posedel we don’t know we actually would look forward to them being sold and purchased by another company besides spansion but i don’t know it’s very complicated so we just get second hand information from them jeffrey scott – scott asset management do you have any idea when that spansion japan will get resolved rhea j posedel i don’t gary do you have any information on that gary l larson no i don’t as i’ve mentioned in the past the status of the spansion japan bankruptcy is very difficult to assess there’s little information that is publically shared it is not at all like the us side where we have filings every day that we can review and go through it really is a matter of just listening as well as we can and trying to get some insight but we haven’t heard anything as far as what might happen any equipment sale obviously would have to be approved by the bankruptcy court in japan we have heard that ge credit has the task of trying to locate buyers so again as rhea said we’d be anxious to see a third party come in and buy that equipment and use it productively jeffrey scott – scott asset management would you expect ge credit to go to both spansion austin and yourselves as a potential buyer of that fox equipment gary l larson if i were ge credit i would go to any entities that i think i could sell it to the difficulty in the past has been since spansion us is also in bankruptcy is getting the two different bankruptcy courts to agree on anything they haven’t been very successful in that so far jeffrey scott – scott asset management what are you hearing about the spansion us bankruptcy gary l larson spansion us bankruptcy they had previously announced that they expected to exit bankruptcy in the first calendar quarter jeffrey scott – scott asset management that was today gary l larson very good i was going to point that out if nobody else did i’ve noticed on their docket filings that they’re scheduling continuation hearings in to april and may so it would obviously be possible at any point in time for them to exit but since i’m still seeing substantive meetings out there i’m guess that we’re at least talking about the later part of the second quarter jeffrey scott – scott asset management is that delaying their ordering pattern any gary l larson the impression that we’ve gotten on that is that they’re only allowed to order on a hand to mouth basis so if they have current order activity that they would have to walk away from if they didn’t order equipment then they’re allowed to order it but they’re not really allowed to anticipate business that might come down the pipe six months out or nine months out most semiconductor manufacturers due that kind of anticipative ordering so we would hope when they exit bankruptcy that could benefit us jeffrey scott – scott asset management so they can order spares and things like that they can’t order a new wafer pack rhea j posedel no they can if they have a production need for it and they can prove they have a production need for it to ship product in the current quarter they can order it but they can’t forecast and say “we think the next two quarters we’re going to need additional systems or additional wafer packs” maybe the product is not ready or the customer hasn’t given them the firm orders yet they can’t buy that type of equipment but if they can prove they need systems or wafer packs to meet shipments to make shipment requirements then they can order it jeffrey scott – scott asset management there was  million worth of deliveries in the february quarter can you be more specific about their ordering pattern subsequent to the february th quarter rhea j posedel i think what we’re looking at now again the visibility from them is very short but it would probably be this quarter if they order anything it would be wafer packs not system upgrades we’ve upgraded four or five system from  to  millimeter and we’d expect maybe to get some wafer pack orders to fill up those systems jeffrey scott – scott asset management on the website the aehr test website there are no jobs posted what has you headcount been over the past quarter rhea j posedel we haven’t added any bodies over the last quarter i did say we would increase rd but probably won’t increase headcount so we have variable labor opportunities that we could either hire temporary people we have a number of software people in india and various places that we can add and expand it would probably be our engineering expenses will go up because of some consulting but also some materials that we have to buy for some of the new developments that we’re doing for our japanese customer jeffrey scott – scott asset management what kind of additional features do you need to put on to your machines in order to make them saleable what i’m trying to get at is inaudible rhea j posedel one large customer for example they wanted to change minor things like changing the board to board spacing or we need to reconfigure the abts for higher power applications so as we said all along it’s a very configurable system so the electronics can be plugged in to different back planes so in some way we’re creating a new back plane or new interface for the burnin board it’s more development type engineering as opposed to rd it’s not doing advanced work in that sense it’s maybe repackaging our abts technology for different applications jeffrey scott – scott asset management it’s really reconfiguring rhea j posedel correct reconfiguring might be a back plane or interface board or something of that sort or racks in one case we’re putting in burnin board automation so we can automatically load the burnin boards in and out of the system things of that sort jeffrey scott – scott asset management is this an existing customer that has asked you to do this rhea j posedel no these would be new customers for abts jeffrey scott – scott asset management is it kind of your understanding that if you can get the abts configured that way that they will buy it rhea j posedel that’s correct if it meets their qualifications jeffrey scott – scott asset management so you’re well down the sales cycle with them rhea j posedel correct so hopefully the next quarter or two we’ll have another announcement of another major account win for the abts jeffrey scott – scott asset management how many abts systems have you now delivered rhea j posedel somewhere between five to  i’m not sure it’s mostly with different customers gary l larson probably on the lower end of that range jeffrey scott – scott asset management what are you finding in terms of your cost of goods sold as you manufacturer more systems is the cost coming down gary l larson because of the very low volume level that we’ve had during the past year it’s a little bit hard to give any good cost of goods information on the abts our max and mtx products when we were at more traditional volume levels were typically in the high  range our fox products were generally in the low  range and we would expect the abts on an ongoing basis to be probably in the low  range jeffrey scott – scott asset management that’s where you are or what you want to get to gary l larson again there have been so few abts’ right now that it’s hard to generalize on our costs particularly with the volume levels that we’ve been seeing we’ll have to hold off on what it will look like i was just giving you my guess rhea j posedel certainly we’re not there now as gary mentioned it’s where we want to get to basically jeffrey scott – scott asset management the maxi that you talked about what was new and different about that particular inaudible rhea j posedel what was exciting for us was that we penetrated a major japanese manufacturer what was unique about it for him was that they were using traditional japanese burnin systems but our max could deliver higher kern the oven could provide higher power dissipation than the current system they’re using it’s a proven solution we had  channels and it could also do this independent temperature control per duct so we had that feature in the max and it’s the i feature there’s additional power supplies and reconfiguring the driver boards to provide the extra current so that’s why they bought the max they couldn’t burnin these high powered devices under existing systems without a huge amount of modification jeffrey scott – scott asset management these were micro controllers rhea j posedel micro controllers for high end consumer products maybe like d tvs things like that sort so the volume of systems they’ll buy in the future could be a lot or a few depending on how well their product succeeds in the marketplace jeffrey scott – scott asset management this was a new customer rhea j posedel a new customer this is a new customer i don’t think we’ve sold to this customer ever the first abts customer we had sold products  years ago to or  years ago jeffrey scott – scott asset management the second one the maxi this is for production rhea j posedel it’s for production the plan is for production jeffrey scott – scott asset management so there is large hope for more orders from that particular customer rhea j posedel that’s the plan and that’s the hope if we’re successful with our first system we’d expect to see follow on orders within the first half of fiscal  operator your next question comes from john evans – edmunds white partners john evans – edmunds white partners can you talk a little bit about i guess with the increases you’re going to have in rd kind of where you estimate you guys will be from a breakeven point or where you have to get to from a revenue standpoint then i don’t know if you talk about this but can you give us kind of a sense of book to build was your bookings stronger than kind of your deliveries or can you give us any kind of insight gary l larson we don’t generally talk about our book to build we do declare our backlog at the end of the fiscal year but we don’t give interim bookings or backlog information generally if we have what we consider to be important orders either from the standpoint of size or if we consider them to be critical new customer opportunities then we will put those orders out on press releases so it’s somewhat easy to at least keep track of the big ones that have come through that way with regard to the rd rhea did mention that we anticipate some additional rd spending but what we also see is rd often times in our business is quite variable from one quarter to the next so there isn’t a set number that we’re putting out there we just wanted to put out an early warning that rd might start to climb somewhat as far as a breakeven point in the past what we’ve said is everything is very much dependent upon mix because as we’ve discussed some of our products right now written off materials end up having  margin and then there are more standard products that are less and we’re also at quite a low level right now so it’s hard to really access the breakeven what we’ve said in the past at our current expense level probably we’d be in the  to  million range to see breakeven john evans – edmunds white partners several of your big customers i think texas is your biggest customer they’ve all talked about having capacity constraints on the test side i guess if you look at a lot of the back end companies they’ve started to see that i guess can you help us understand maybe why you potentially are a lager in that or why you haven’t seen as much ramp yet rhea j posedel that’s a good question in particular speaking about texas instruments where they certainly had bottlenecks in testers so i think we’re kind of at the end of that chain for them first they need fab capacity then it becomes assembly then test capacity and then i think after that hopefully it’s going to be they need more burnin capacity jon evans – edmunds white partners but you don’t believe that you’ve lost share at texas rhea j posedel no no no i don’t think so i’ll find out more tomorrow then austin i’m going to go to dallas tomorrow it’s my mission jon evans – edmunds white partners so what we should believe is they’re saying on their conference call that they’re saying they’re getting more in line from the test side hopefully   or  days from that you should see that in on the burnin side rhea j posedel at least some of it it depends on where they are capacity wide in our systems and product mix some of their devices maybe don’t need burnin or they don’t do as much burnin on them and other ones do so different devices at different times require more or less they’re automotive devices require  hour burnin they’re dsps maybe require less or just early life type burnin so it does depend on their product mix somewhat but if general if they’re seeing a push in all areas then i think that’s going to be to our advantage they had a number of our test systems turned off in  when they’re volumes were low now i think pretty much all of them are turned back on so if they see any increase in capacity they’ll have to add burnin systems but we haven’t lost share with them jon evans – edmunds white partners i know you didn’t want to answer this before and it’s difficult because of the different products and mixes but i guess can you help us understand maybe why you feel comfortable with kicking rd up with sales at such low levels what i guess i’m trying to get to is can you help us understand from a cash basis will you not burn cash then over the next couple of quarters can you give us any insight in to that rhea j posedel basically i looked at it as a positive in the sense that and maybe jeff kind of alluded he was prying me on that what is it for it’s not major new developments but it’s doing some customization or specialization and modification of these system for a few customers to get qualified and get some production orders it’s just spending money on materials to win some new accounts that’s all it’s not going to be  higher or whatever but maybe  or  higher than what we’re normally running it’s things that we need to do to win orders and it means that we’re fairly far along the sales cycle to win these orders jon evans – edmunds white partners may i just ask you then relative to that can you give us any kind of sense of size of those if you’re successful in basically redoing the system to those specifications how much business potentially is there to win here rhea j posedel that’s a good question it could be  to  systems over a few years jon evans – edmunds white partners the last question i had for you is when you think about test capacity the test companies kind of talk about utilization capacity utilization is there any way for you to talk to your customers or give us a sense of kind of utilization of your systems and kind of what’s the breaking point before they have to start to add significant capacity rhea j posedel it really depends on which ones we have service contracts in for example at texas instruments we have service contracts so we know what systems are turned on and turned off and are utilized but other accounts we don’t have that visibility and there are a lot of accounts that we’re not in so it’s hard for us to figure that out there’s no research that’s done in our sector the only way you can do it is go around and call on customers and try and find out that way and how they’re doing but our objective is to penetrate more new accounts with our products that’s our major goal this year so we can spread our customer base rather than just have spansion and texas instructions we want to have multiple production customers operator your next question comes from joy muckergee – unidentified joy muckergee – unidentified most of the questions have been answered but will you talk a little bit about the nor market and what the outlook is for nor flash rhea j posedel well i think certainly the growth that you read about is in the nan flash obviously spansion is bullish about their business going forward although they’ve shrunk it kind of jettison the mobile market but we feel there’s still growth at spansion because right now they just have a few foxs and wafer packs so most of the systems that we sold them are in japan in the bankrupt part of their company i think that nor flash is still going to be there there’s still a market for it and i don’t see it going away any time soon a nan flash if you need high density memory cheap memory that’s flash memory that’s the way to go but there’s a lot of applications where you don’t need that much memory that you need the reliability of the nor flash so there is this strong segment for nor flash i don’t see anything that is going to change it as they grow in density the test times get longer so they need more test equipment joy muckergee – unidentified then on the competitive front has anything changed is form factor a bigger player against what you do rhea j posedel form factor makes the prob cards they can compete against us i guess on our wafer packs for the foxs if they can do full wafer up to that density maybe certainly they’re trying to joy muckergee – unidentified so other than that you haven’t seen much of change in the landscape rhea j posedel not on the system approach arena operator management i’m showing no further questions please continue with any further remarks rhea j posedel this is rhea and i’d like to thank you for joining us this afternoon and we look forward to next quarter’s conference call thanks and good evening operator ladies and gentlemen

projections regarding aehr test’s future financialperformance actual results may differmaterially from projected results and should not be considered as an indicationof future performance these risks anduncertainties include without limitation economic conditions in asia andelsewhere world events acceptance by customers or our fox mtx max anddiepak technologies end conversion of quote activity to purchase orders andacceptance by customers of products shipped upon receipt of a purchase orderthe ability of new products to meet customer needs or performance describedthe company’s development and manufacture of a commercially successful waferlevel test and burnin system and the potential emergence of alternativetechnology each of which could adversely affect demand for aehr test’s productsin calendar year  we refer you to our most recent k report and other reportsfiled from timetotime with the securities  exchange commission for amore detailed description of the risks facing our business and factors thatcould cause actual results to differ materially from projected results the company disclaims any obligation toupdate information contained in any forwardlooking statements reflected andfor circumstances occurring after the date of this conference call now i’d like to introduce you to ourchairman and ceo rhea posedel rhea j posedel welcome to our conference call for the second quarter offiscal  we are pleased to reportthat we had one of the best quarters we’ve had in a number of years net sales for the second quarter of fiscal were  million up  over the same quarter of the prior year and up sequentially importantly asignificant portion of our revenue increase flowed to operating income whichincreased by  million over the same quarter of the prior year we continued to be excited about the significant growth opportunities we seefor our fox testers and waferpaks earlier this quarter we announced a  million follow on order formultiple fox testers for a new mm fab our highly paralleled fox full wafer tester and its waferpakcontactors moves the company into the large growing market for wafer protesting this is a new market aehr testand it significantly expands our addressable markets industry experts estimate that the totalavailable market for wafer pro testing including the consumable probe cards isin excess of  billion per year withour fox product we are targeting the market segments for ics with long testtimes such as flash memories also orders for our waferpak contactors were solid during thequarter providing further evidence that this can bea potential strongrevenue stream and we expect additional orders as our installed based of mmfox testers increases our full wafercontactors are customdesigned for each wafer device type itis a keytechnology that enables our fox system to parallel test thousands of die ina singletouchdown designing and producingcustomer waferpak contactors that can contact thousand of die over amm wafer is a majortechnical challenge during thequarter we continued to invest inthe development ofdesign tools and manufacturing processes to increase our waferpak capacity andreduce our cycle times i’m pleased to saythat we made significant progress this past quarter but we still have aways to go another major event of the quarter was shipping our firstfox wafer level burnin and test system for a leading automotive icmanufacturer we are proud of the broadtechnical accomplishments of our engineering team that made this possible the fox system is a second generationwafer level burnin and test system itis our first system to utilize our newly designed configurable hardware andsoftware platform our major technicalchallenge was developing waferpak contactors that can work reliably andrepeatedly during the high temperature requirements of wafer level burnin andtest we believe shipping our fox systems helps validates thatour technology is a costeffective solution for processing wafers for automotive and known good dieapplications we arenow aggressively targeting these growing markets with our fox wafer levelburnin and test system we haveinstalled our fox system and our customer hasstarted to run qualification wafers weexpect the acceptancephase correlation studies to belengthy as our customer wants to domultiple burnin runs to ensure that thewafers processed by our fox system meets their automotive customer’sstringent quality and reliability specifications this acceptance could take up to sixmonths or more but we arehopefully that itcould happen in ourfourth quarter revenue for this multimillion dollar system will berecorded following customer acceptance our near term goal is to add one or two new customers forour fox products and grow market share in the rapidly expanded automotive testequipment or ate market segment for full wafer test and burnin we continue to see interest in both our foxproducts however it seemed to always take longer than you expect to penetrateproduction accounts with a new technology the balance of this fiscal year we will continue to investin rd to improve the performance of our core parallel test and burninsystems for packaged devices ourobjective is to roll out new products over the next six to  months using ournew configurable hardware and software platform developed for our foxproducts we believe that these new coreproducts will increase our competitiveness in the asian market and enable us toincrease market share in the rapidly growing segments for high power logicburnin and massively parallel test and burnin for drams in closing we continue to be encouraged by the bookings wepotentially see from our initial fox customer and the opportunities we haveto add additional customers for our fox products over the long term based on our strong backlog of orders for ourfox parallel testers and waferpak contactors we expect to grow both revenueand net profit in our third fiscal quarter when compared to the quarter justreported now i’d like to turn the call over the garyand he’ll add some color to the second quarter financials gary l larson net sales were  million in the second quarter of fiscal an increase of  from  million in the second quarter fiscal  andan increase of  from  million in the prior quarter in the second quarter of fiscal  foxsystems and contactors represented the majority of our net sales as rhea had mentioned earlier we shipped thefox system this quarter we expect torecord revenue for it upon completion of customer acceptance gross margin was  for the second quarter compared with in the year ago quarter grossmargin increased primarily because fox products with somewhat higher marginsrepresented a higher portion of net sales on a going forward basis we believe that the typical gross margin willbe about  sga was  million in the second quarter comparedwith  million in the prior year period the increase in sga dollars is primarily attributable to anincrease in headcount as we added support resources to address the expectedgrowth in our business second quarter  rd expense was  million down slightlyfrom  million in the second quarter of last year rd expense varies fromquartertoquarter depending on product development expenses and this quarter’slevel was lower than is typical weexpect rd expense to increase somewhat during the second half of thisfiscal year as we add engineering resources to grow our custom waferpakcontactor business income from operations for the second quarter of  was million compared to a loss from operations of  for the secondquarter of  comparing this quarterto the same quarter of the prior year operating income increased by nearly million while sales were up  million this demonstrates the leverage available to the company when sales aregrowing and product mix is shifting more towards fox products our net income for the second quarter was  million or per share compared with net income of  or  per share a yearago and compared to net income in the prior quarter of  or  pershare excluding stock compensationexpense in these periods pro forma net income in the second quarter of fiscal was  million or  per share compared with  or  pershare in the same period of the prior year and compared to  or inaudiblein the prior quarter net sales were  million in the first six months offiscal  compared with  million in the first six months of fiscal net income for the six monthsended november   was  million or  per diluted share comparedwith net income of  million or  per diluted share in the same periodof the prior fiscal year we continue to have a solid balance sheet our cash cash equivalent and short terminvestments stood at  million at november   this total is  million lower than at theprior quarter end and results from the increase in accounts receivable duringthe second quarter accounts receivablewas  million at the end of the second quarter a  million dollar increasefrom the end of the prior quarter theincrease is primarily attributable to the higher levels of sales as well as anincrease in the level of receivables in japanwhich typically has longer payment terms our inventory was  million at november  essentially flat with inventories at the end of the prior quarter shareholders’ equity was  million or per share outstanding at november   and we continue to have nooutstanding debt we’re now ready to answer your questions operator please go ahead questionandanswersession operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from ramesh misrafrom collins stewart please go ahead ramesh misra –collins steward llc my first question rhea was for you can you qualitatively talk about what thebook to build or backlog number was iknow you tend to report backlog normally at the end of the fiscal year but canyou at least give a directional indication rhea j posedel okay as you know wedon’t report bookings per quarter but we did announce  million worth of foxsystem orders early in the quarter gary l larson we announced itearly in thequarter rhea j posedel for the prior quarter and the quarter just finished in the second quarter we announced million worth of fox system bookings and we also talked about receivingadditional waferpak bookings for those systems obviously our book to build was higher than what we shipped but we don’treport bookings primarily because we have a very lumpy bookings per quarter andoften times a week or so can make a significant change in whether the bookingsis one and a half to one book to build or half depending on when the ordercomes in and often times our customer’sknow that and put pressure on us for discounts at the end of a quarter youknow book order so by not reportingbookings it actually saves trying to accelerate bookings and giving additionaldiscounts ramesh misra –collins steward llc you alluded to orders for the waferpak for these  systemsthat you received orders for typicallyhow many waferpaks are ordered for each of the fox systems rhea j posedel i would say somewhere from one and half to two ramesh misra –collins steward llc okay so have youreceived waferpaks for all of the systems that you received orders for rhea j posedel they tend to delay them somewhat but i don’t know wehaven’t tried to match them up ramesh misra –collins steward llc in terms of these systems the  million order that youreceived by when do you expect it to be shipped so i’m talking shipment not recognizingrevenues rhea j posedel i think we would actually ship during this fiscal year ramesh misra – collinssteward llc so by the end of may you should have it shipped if this is a repeat customer rhea would theacceptance cycle be shrunk rhea j posedel yes gary l larson basically on these repeat orders when the customer hasalready accepted the initial system then the revenue is recorded on shipmentfor the follow on unit ramesh misra –collins steward llc so basically it’s reasonable to expect that the revenues forthese  systems should be recognized also by the end of the current fiscalyear gary l larson yep ramesh misra –collins steward llc now shifting again to thewafer related to thecomplexity of theparts or asps they’re actually decline rhea j posedel that’s agood question i would saythe asps – let’s saythe selling price canvary anywhere from  to  i think a goodrule of thumb would bearound  conservatively ramesh misra –collins steward llc okay rhea j posedel and to answer your other question itis going up a littlebit as we see waferswith more die on them then weobviously have ahigher number of pins and theselling price increased because theselling prices is based on thenumber of contacts or thenumber of pins we provide ramesh misra –collins steward llc now clearly one of the issues you had previously rhea wasthe ability to supply enough waferpaks can you talk about how you resolved that or how far are you along in theprocess of resolving that rhea j posedel as i mentioned inthe conference callscript designing and producing waferpaks is amajor challenge i think initially whenwe started this project we were selling mm fox and mm waferpaks and ithink we’ve been able to overcome delivers on themm at least most ofthem and now we’re facing thechallenge of developing or designing mm waferpaks and as i mentioned we’ve invested alot in design tools inorder to reduce our cycle times soit’s a lengthy processbut we feel we’re making good progress on that ramesh misra – collinssteward llc related to the delivery of the fox systems obviously the customer wouldn’t want thesystem to be sitting there without waferpaks do you have the capability to supply the contactors as well by the timethese systems are delivered before the end of the fiscal year rhea j posedel i believe so ramesh misra –collins steward llc okay rhea j posedel i think historically they tend to buy more waferpaks thanthey have systems for ramesh misra –collins steward llc right rhea j posedel we will have enough waferpaks we believe for our installedbasis systems ramesh misra –collins steward llc and again this entire order was for mm tools soclearly all of thewaferpaks are mm rhea j posedel yes currently thenew waferpaks are mm ramesh misra –collins steward llc shifting gears a little but your rd expense i recognizethe fact that yearoveryear was down actually i think the lowest level thatits ever been in the last four quarters or so obviously there’s a lot ofvariation in it but does this reflect the conclusion of any particular projectyou might have been working on gary l larson well there are always projects that are ongoing and projects that are comingcloser to fruition what this shows isthat a number of expenses that would have more recently showed up in rdexpenses were showing up in inventory and costs of goods and that’s because aproduct has reached a point of maturity where we’re allowed to do that by theaccounting rules and that was mycomment about variations from quartertoquarter you will see ups and downs in particularly inthe rd expense arena we’ll have substantial material expenses that willshow up in rd expense and then in another quarter just as we saw this timearound those similar expenses may be counted as inventory or cost of goodsbased on the nature of that particular product ramesh misra –collins steward llc okay and just aclarification on that comment about second half rd expense are you suggesting that it just goes back tothe historical level that it has been or do you think the second half will actually be modestly high than arolling quarter average rd expenditure has been gary l larson well definitely higher than the quarter just ended that was the message we were trying tosend but as you point out since we aregearing up on the waferpak contactors in a way we haven’t before it wouldn’t besurprising if we saw the rd expense go higher than the recentaverages ramesh misra –collins steward llc that helps inregards to the tax rate this quarter’s tax rate was about  or so gary how should we think of tax rate goingforward i know its difficult to predictthat with a fine degree of precision but all the same its been running a lotlower than previously and i believe you might – some of your nols might becoming to an end so how should wethink of tax rate going forward gary l larson i would say that the best thing you can do at this point isto assume similar rates to what you’ve seen us booking in the first and secondquarter of this fiscal year you’reright we do have nols in the us andnols in japan some of those nols in japanare going to be completely consumed this year resulting in a higher effectivetax rate and that’s what we’re trying to reflect it will depend on how the business plays outbetween the us japanand our other subsidiaries what the ultimate rate may be but i would say looking at the rates webooked in q and q would be the best way to estimate it at this point ramesh misra –collins steward llc looking at these revenues rhea can you give us a sense ofhow much of it came from the fox systems and how much came from your legacy maxand mts systems gary l larson in the conference call i mentioned that the majority of ourbusiness did come from fox products this quarter ramesh misra –collins steward llc can you give us any indication of what’s happening on thelegacy side further down the line clearly there is a slowdown in overall cap ex spending in the industryso do you anticipate that your legacy business will remain subdued on accountof that rhea j posedel you’re correct in that we’re seeing certainly the capacitybias aren’t there for core products for burnin and parallel test and this is why we’re taking a proactiveapproach to enhance and roll out new products that allows us to compete in somenew market places for our max and mtx we believe we can – certainly we talked about rolling them out the nextsix to  months and we think these new products should start having revenueagain in the next fiscal year ramesh misra – collins steward llc so these are redesigned max and mtx systems rhea j posedel right they would bea next generation max or a next generation mtx using the core hardware softwarethat we developed for our fox products so we will migrate that technology to our max and mtx ramesh misra –collins steward llc okay again kind oftrying to look at it more finely do you anticipate the fox revenues to bealso up in the february quarter gary l larson on a quartertoquarter basis ramesh misra –collins steward llc yes gary l larson we haven’t given that guidance but we are expecting revenue to be up on aquartertoquarter basis but we’re not breaking that guidance down by product ramesh misra –collins steward llc i think that covers most of my questions for now thank you gentlemen operator our next question comes from brian wilkinson from lewisasset management please go ahead brian wilkinson –lewis asset management i think ramesh covered most of what i was thinkingabout i was just going to ask about theaddressable market in general how much of that  billion probe carb market rhea j posedel i’d say it was a wafer probe test market brian wilkinson –lewis asset management how much do you cover currently with products that you haveto market and the customers and perspective customers that you’re touchingright now what’s the addressable – yourpart of it rhea j posedel we provide in our financial picture a company estimate ofwhat we believe our segment for fox products is and we estimate it to be about million by the year  brian wilkinson –lewis asset management by the year  rhea j posedel calendar  brian wilkinson –lewis asset management and what are you right now for  rhea j posedel say it again brian wilkinson –lewis asset management what’s the current addressable market how much for  rhea j posedel what we’re saying for calendar  would be somewhere around million  million brian wilkinson –lewis asset management but double that by next year this time rhea j posedel correct operator our next question comes from jeffery scott from scott assetmanagement please go ahead jeffrey scott – scottasset management fox you said on the technology side you still have a wayto go can you explain what problemsneed to be resolved rhea j posedel i meant on the waferpak reducing the cycle time from whenwe get the order until when we deliver it jeffrey scott – scottasset management so the production technology is okay it’s just a questionof the turnaround time rhea j posedel correct when westarted developing waferpaks initially it took us months and months to designit which is too long and then we had to shorten that design phase where thecustomers expecting deliveries in say three months we need to get down to that level two to threemonths so our delivery lead times aretoo long jeffrey scott – scottasset management the fox customer is that a new customer to aehr test rhea j posedel no it’s a customer that we had sold max products to it’s a new customer for fox but it’s acustomer we had sold max jeffrey scott – scottasset management everything’s a new customer for fox rhea j posedel that’s correct jeffrey scott – scottasset management so they new you via the old legacy max product rhea j posedel that’s correct sothat’s how we had the relationship and that’s how we basically got in and wereable to sell them on our fox technology jeffrey scott – scottasset management and these have been delivered to a usdomestic location rhea j posedel no i didn’t say that jeffrey scott – scottasset management okay rhea j posedel i would say its an international location jeffrey scott – scottasset management okay how manysystems could this particular customer order rhea j posedel when we talked to them initially he was saying somewherebetween five and  over a number of years of course jeffrey scott – scottasset management somewhere between five and  you still have just the order for one right rhea j posedel correct jeffrey scott – scottasset management so five to  would be over some period of time rhea j posedel correct jeffrey scott – scottasset management what do you think you have to do to get the customer toorder more rhea j posedel as i highlighted in the conference call i think what he islooking for is a system that offers the reliability and the repeatability thathe needs to ensure that he meets his customer’s stringent requirements forwafer level burnin so he’s a verydetailed customer i mean certainly wecan do the job but he wants to see  of his wafers work every time andthat’s the challenge that we have to get towards we have to give him a high confidence that wecan get some high yields when he processes wafers the only way you’re going to do that is torun multiple wafers and see what the issues are and if there are any then fixthem jeffrey scott – scottasset management are you expecting significant issues rhea j posedel yeah i guess you always expect there to be issues but you’realways hoping for the best so you haveto be prepared to deal with some of these issues jeffrey scott – scottasset management okay the five to over time those will be delivered to the same location the first one went to rhea j posedel yes jeffrey scott – scottasset management are there other locations rhea j posedel no this customer just has one location jeffrey scott – scottasset management just one location rhea j posedel what would have to also happen is heprobably would need to – as headds more devices so this is onedevice type so thisone device type is maybe one or two systems and as headds more device types itcould be moresystems but again i think theleverage here could bethat the end customeris a leading carmanufacturer and if that carmanufacturer likes thewafer technology and if itprovides them with reliable quality die then our hope is that they require someof their ic suppliers to use our fox product so that’s where thebig leverage couldbe if we can besuccessful in thisproject jeffrey scott – scottasset management that would actually play out over some number of years wouldit not rhea j posedel that’s correct butthat would broaden our customer base instead of one customer it could bemultiple customers who would be interested in our fox product jeffrey scott – scottasset management all driven by the success rhea j posedel of this one large – as you know there’s only a few largeautomotive companies in the world jeffrey scott – scottasset management you talked about thefox having applications for other people that were inthe known good diebusiness what other other than autoswould you characterize this as being in rhea j posedel one customer that we’re talking with is adram customer and they’re looking atselling their dram chip into astack package that goes into handheld communication devices that’s avery broad application soit’s stack packages vertical stack packages for thehandheld consumer market jeffrey scott – scottasset management is that something that would play out over a shorter periodof time rhea j posedel if we’re successful with that customer that could happenwithin the next  months jeffrey scott – scottasset management you still have a goal of one new customer for fox and onenew customer for fox right rhea j posedel that is correct ormore jeffrey scott – scottasset management have you been able to – are you more hopeful now than youwere three months ago that you’ve found that particular new customer rhea j posedel i think shipping the fox certainly helps on the waferlevel burnin front because it really validates that our technology works andcertainly reduces barriers that prevent people from buying these kinds ofproducts and on the fox side i thinkwe’ve come closer to selling a few customers so yeah i think we’re further than three months ago operator operator instructions our next question is a follow up from ramesh misra please go ahead ramesh misra –collins steward llc just a quick clarification you previously talked about the burn in system has being fox is the fox just a slightly modifiedversion with one additional slot or are there some additional fundamentalchanges because i know you had shown the fox at the show in july last yearnot the fox rhea j posedel i think initially when we sold the order to our automotiveic manufacturer it was a fox system which was our first generation waferlevel burnin and test system and aswe got further into the project we decided to basically upgrade the technologyhardware software taking it from the fox and using that hardware softwareplatform and at the same time we also added one additional wafer slot but not only is it a  slot system butbasically it’s almost from a ground up everything is new and enhanced from ourfox system so it truly is a nextgeneration wafer level burnin and test system from the ground up operator our next question comes from larry brooks from maloneysecurities please go ahead larry brooks –maloney securities i’m wondering the approximate value for a sale on a foxwhat that would go for rhea j posedel if you looked at the system and the  wafer pack contactorsit would be in excess of  million larry brooks –maloney securities with the current products that you are manufacturing are youhaving any supply issues and problems getting the components that you need tomake the products rhea j posedel i don’t think any more than we would on the max or themtx i think we have hired a new vp ofoperations joel bustos and i think he’s certainly strengthened the supplychain so i think we see less issues onthe material side larry brooks –maloney securities you of course talked about your account receivables and itof course being a japanese company is this a new group that you’re dealingwith or is this someone that you’ve dealt with before gary l larson no we’ve dealt with this customer before larry brooks –maloney securities okay so logicallyyou don’t expect to see any problems gary l larson no larry brooks –maloney securities i guess the last thing is the seasonality of yourcompany are you seeing any issues whereone quarter is generally stronger than another rhea j posedel i can’t see over the  years that we’ve been in busy thatthere’s been any seasonality it variesmore i guess with the ups and downs of the semiconductor industry operator at this time we have no further questions in queue i would like to send the conference back tomanagement for any concluding comments please go ahead rhea j posedel i’d like to thank you for joining us this afternoon and welook forward to next quarter’s conference call thanks again operator ladies and gentlemen
