keeping the amount of buying and selling to a minimum the idea is to avoid the fees and the drag on performance that potentially occur from frequent trading passive investing is not aimed at making quick gains or at getting rich with one great bet but rather on building slow steady wealth over time breaking down passive investing also known as a buyandhold strategy passive investing involves buying a security with the intention of owning it for many years unlike active traders passive investors are not attempting to profit from shortterm price fluctuations or otherwise time the market the basic assumption that underpins a passive investment strategy is that the market generally posts positive returns given enough timepassive investing strategytraditionally passive investors attempt to

fully passive buffett is a big proponent of index investing in  to prove the superiority of passive management buffett challenged the hedge fund industry – the quintessential active investors – to a year contest he put a million dollars in vanguards sp  admiral fund the first index fund available to retail investors while protégé partners llc the hedge fund that took him up on his challenge
