options for its customers us important as alternatives to cable and satellite tv profilerate while twc carries competitors such as netflix and hulu via its isp such services could eat into twcs more profitable cable business another potential problem for twc is the federal communications commissions vote to regulate the internet like a utility that could prevent twc and its competitors or eventual partner comcast from finding sources of revenue in different tiers of service the company is focused on improving the quality and reliability of its residential products and offering distinguished customer service twc expects to see continued strong growth in its business services segment it predicts revenue of more than  billion from those offerings by  mergers and acquisitions
