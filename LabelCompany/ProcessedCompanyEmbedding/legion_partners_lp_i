other stockholders of rcm technologies inc nasdaq rcmt which has nominated two director nominees to the board of directors of rcm at the  annual meeting of stockholders today issued the following letter to all stockholders october   dear fellow rcm technologies inc stockholders interests of stockholder group led by legion partners are directly aligned with all rcm stockholders do not be misled by rcms recent cosmetic changes please sign and return the enclosed gold proxy card today to support truly independent directors committed to maximizing the value of your investment legion partners asset management llc legion partners together with irs partners no  lp irs partners and several others have formed a group which collectively is the largest stockholder of rcm technologies inc nasdaqgm rcmt referred to herein as rcm or the company  our group has combined ownership of approximately  of the outstanding shares of rcm  we have nominated two independent directors for election to the board of directors of rcm the board at the  annual meeting of stockholders scheduled to be held on december   the  annual meeting due to our serious concerns with the perennial financial deterioration of the company over the past decade  in addition to corporate profits in freefall we are alarmed by the companys abysmal capital allocation track record and poorly aligned compensation and corporate governance practices including among other things the granting of upwards of  million in severance to leon kopyt the companys chairman and ceo if even one of our nominees is elected to the board and he is terminated without cause or leaves for good reason  it is unfortunate to see rcms board and management resort to this level of entrenchment—effectively allowing them to hold the company hostage by curtailing stockholders right to democracy through the threat of mr kopyts platinum parachute      in an effort to look responsive to stockholders the board has recently adopted some corporate governance reforms based on the proposals we submitted to the company and intended to bring before the  annual meeting  as a result of our repeated calls to return capital to stockholders the company announced a special dividend and a stock buy  we urge stockholders not to be misled  the board has acted only when faced with the prospect of a proxy contest and pressure from its largest stockholder to make these changes  while we believe there is significant value to be unlocked at rcm we believe such value can only be unlocked with immediate change to the status quo starting with the election of our two highlyqualified independent director nominees roger h ballou and bradley s vizi operationsstrategy—roger h ballou is a retired executive with over 0 years of industry experience including almost a decade as the ceo of rcms closest public competitor cdi corp  mr ballou was also instrumental in turning around and building several businesses including alamo rentacar and american expresss travel services group stockholder valueaccountability—bradley s vizi a founder of legion partners is a public and private equity investor whose investment background encompasses capital allocation corporate governance and executive compensation  as a member of the stockholder group led by legion partners with a combined ownership of approximately  of the outstanding shares of rcm mr vizi has significant skin in the game to promote greater accountability and maximize stockholder value we are frustrated with the boards readiness to waste stockholder capital to engage in an election contest with us  despite the boards mischaracterization of our settlement discussions regarding the timing to declassify the board which was our initiative in the first place we were amenable to declassifying the board at the  annual meeting if the company in turn agreed that all directors would stand for reelection to serve oneyear terms at the 0 annual meeting of stockholders not just our two nominees  we note that while the company has agreed to declassify the board at the  annual meeting only two director seats are up for election at the  annual meeting and the other incumbent directors who were previously appointed to threeyear terms including one director who was appointed by the board mid and has never stood for election and a vote of stockholders will continue to serve until the end of their terms which expire in 0 and  we believe the continued decline in rcms profits to be cause for significant concern and immediate action the current board and management team have overseen a decline in sales from  million in  to  million in the last twelvemonth period ending june   a drop of approximately   over the same period ebitda operating earnings excluding depreciation and amortization has declined from  million to  million a drop of approximately   the companys longterm performance demonstrates an even more alarming trend of deteriorating financials and value destruction  from  through the last twelve months ending june   the companys sales have declined from 0 million to  million or approximately   over the same period ebitda has decreased from  million to  million or approximately   it is important to note that the decline in revenue and ebitda would be even more substantial if the additive impact of failed acquisitions were taken into account  we urge stockholders to support the election of our director nominees before the company falls into an irreversible state of disrepair click below to view graph photo httpphotosprnewswirecomprnh0sfa   rcm has consistently underperformed its peers when considering rcms financial results against its peer set the case for change is even more evident  on average peers have significantly improved their performance over the past five years vs rcm whose ebitda has declined by more than onethird  since  the peer set has grown its revenue and ebitda  and  respectively while rcms revenue and ebitda have declined  and  respectively  furthermore the companys average return on invested capital over the last five years of  is approximately  below its peer set at   this dismal absolute and relative financial performance serves as a clarion call for investors to take action by electing our nominees who are committed to maximizing the value of rcm for all stockholders click below to view graph photo httpphotosprnewswirecomprnh0sfb   we believe a disciplined approach to capital allocation is essential to stop the hemorrhaging of stockholder value in addition to the prolific value destruction reflected in rcms income statement the incumbent management team and members of the board have overseen an illadvised acquisition strategy that has resulted in nearly  million of writeoffs associated with goodwill and other intangibles from  to  despite spending approximately  million on acquisitions since   in other words the company has written off nearly three times x its current enterprise value and five times x the enterprise value from when we began accumulating shares and engaging in discussions with the company in 0 with nothing to show for it but a  decline in ebitda  furthermore when taking into account these writeoffs the company has failed to earn its cost of capital in any single year going back to  as demonstrated by disappointing historical returns on invested capital click below to view graph photo httpphotosprnewswirecomprnh0sfc   when we first met with the company in april 0 we raised the concept of a special dividend in light of the free cash flow the business was generating its overcapitalized balance sheet and the recurring absence of total return for investors  at the time approximately 0 of the companys market cap was in cash and the board and management had no history of returning cash to stockholders in the form of a dividend  we explained that cash on the balance sheet of companies with questionable capital allocation track records is often valued at or near zero by the market and in some instances may actually demonstrate a negative value  only after several such discussions with us over an month period did the company finally pay its first cash dividend to stockholders in december   with the prospect of an election contest in roughly five weeks the board has now announced on october   a  million stock buyback program as a means to return capital to stockholders  once again we see evidence of a board slow to act unless pressured by a significant stockholder advocating for change   the current board has proven incapable of delivering returns to stockholders  we believe a reconstituted board committed to a disciplined wellvetted approach to capital allocation is an essential remedial step to prevent repeating past woes and to maximize the value of rcm going forward  however a commitment toward driving roic to higher levels and enhancing stockholder value must go beyond the regular evaluation of alternative uses of capital and serve as the cornerstone of a welldesigned compensation program misguided compensation practices demonstrate asymmetric potential payoff to management at the cost of stockholders we believe rcms compensation practices are a hallmark of a company where the interests of stockholders take a back seat to those of the board and management team  despite poor operating performance on december   the company adopted executive severance agreements for rocco campanelli the companys executive vice president and kevin miller the companys chief financial officer  these agreements provide for among other things severance upon termination related to a change in control and a change in control payment in each case equal to two  times each executives respective annual base salary and bonus  these agreements are in addition to the companys termination benefits agreement with leon kopyt the chairman president and chief executive officer of the company which provides for among other things a severance package consisting of five years of annual base salary and bonus in addition to however many years are remaining on his employment agreement if he is terminated without cause or if he resigns for good reason following a change in control  if mr kopyt were terminated in  he would be entitled to a payment representing approximately eight years of salary and bonus including tax gross up and other benefits under his termination benefits agreement    the definition of change in control under kopyts termination benefits agreement as well as mr kopyts severance agreement discussed below includes the appointment of just one nominee to the board in connection with a proxy contest  in other words if stockholders choose to exercise their right of democratic process which results in the election of just one stockholdernominated director to the board and mr kopyt is thereafter terminated without cause or leaves the company for good reason he is entitled to receive a windfall payout of more than  million or roughly  of the current enterprise value of rcm 0 at the beginning of our accumulation of shares and engagement in discussions with the company  in addition to this termination benefits agreement the board has also adopted a separate severance agreement for mr kopyt if he is terminated without cause or leaves for good reason  under his severance agreement good reason includes the right of mr kopyt to resign at his discretion during the onemonth period commencing twelve  months following a change in control  as a result if we are successful in electing just one of our director nominees to the board mr kopyt would have the ability to wait one year abandon his position as president and ceo for any or no reason whatsoever and collect  million under his severance agreement calculated as of december    it is deeply disturbing that the board would approve executive severance arrangements for messrs campanelli and miller when the projected cash payment calculated as of december   under the kopyts termination benefits agreement alone is approximately  of the companys net income for fiscal   we do not believe these pay packages are reasonable or warranted given the companys poor financial performance and dismal return on capital to stockholders and we are not alone in our belief  in 0 institutional shareholder services iss a leading proxy advisory firm recommended withhold votes from the companys current director nominee robert b kerr for serving on the companys compensation committee that has maintained executive agreements that contain overly generous severance payments  iss considers outsized changeincontrol provisions problematic as they can potentially lead to packages that are so generous that they fail to hold executives accountable for poor performance  noting the companys problematic pay practices policy iss stated it finds these outsized severance packages to be concerning and recommended withhold votes for mr kerr and also existing board member lawrence needleman who the board recently announced would not be standing for reelection at the  annual meeting    recent board actions set disturbing precedent to disenfranchise stockholders in a desperate attempt to insulate itself from change the board has undertaken a disturbing set of actions to disenfranchise stockholders  the current board delayed the  annual meeting by six months in response to our nomination of two director candidates and three business proposals  by delaying the  annual meeting by six months and scheduling it in the middle of the  holiday season we believe the board is attempting to impede stockholders right to a democratic process  when coupled with the fact that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by stockholders holding at least 0 entitled to vote at such meeting and stockholders can only act by unanimous written consent the board has made it particularly difficult for stockholders to hold the board accountable in a timely manner   within just weeks of receiving our nominations and business proposals the current board adopted a shareholder rights plan or poison pill with a  ownership limitation just above our groups then current ownership in the company of  of the outstanding shares and without stockholder approval  notwithstanding its prior announcement that it would submit the rights plan for ratification at the  annual meeting an announcement prompted by our public criticism of the rights plan the board is once again disenfranchising stockholders by not allowing stockholders to vote on the plan  with a termination date in january 0 just one month after the  annual meeting we hope that the board will not act unilaterally to extend the rights plan when it currently has the opportunity to let stockholders approve the plan and any extension thereto at the  annual meeting     moreover the board maintained a classified board for the past  years and only recently agreed to destagger the board after we in private and public communications advocated for the board to be declassified  do not be misled by the companys mischaracterizations of our settlement discussions alleging that we sought to delay the implementation of our very own proposal to declassify the board  to set the record straight  we were amenable to the implementation of the declassification proposal at the  annual meeting if the company in turn agreed that all directors would stand for reelection to serve oneyear terms at next years annual meeting of stockholders not just our  director nominees  ironically the board not only failed to disclose the settlement discussions surrounding our alternative proposal but also failed to disclose its blatant rejection thereof  the board also failed to disclose that it requested a covenant not to sue and a release of all claims as a condition to its settlement proposal  what could the board be so worried about to demand these conditions  do they have something to hide that they need to request not only a covenant not to sue but also a release of all claims the boards efforts to now paint a different picture is a sad attempt to divert stockholders attention from the real issues at hand – that being the historical underperformance of this company and the boards lack of accountability to stockholders the board needs an independent chairman to hold management accountable given this boards recent actions to disenfranchise stockholders its approval of outrageous compensation packages for senior management and the companys significant underperformance all led under chairman and ceo leon kopyt we find it even more crucial than ever that the board adopt a policy that the boards chairman be an independent director according to the definition set forth in the nasdaq listing standards  the companys proposal to appoint a lead independent director does not go far enough particularly since its choice to serve in such role is robert b kerr a director for over  years and the second longest serving director on the board behind mr kopyt himself  how independent can mr kerr be given his long tenure with the company  we urge stockholders to approve our nonbinding proposal to separate the roles of chairman and ceo at the  annual meeting  if approved our director nominees if elected will remain committed to further corporate governance reforms promoting greater stockholder accountability at the company the boards cosmetic changes do not go far enough while the board may have made some cosmetic changes to its corporate governance by declassifying the board and providing that directors be elected by a majority vote standard in each case based on our proposals that we intended to bring before the  annual meeting we caution stockholders that given the reactionary nature and long history of poor corporate governance practices the companys move appears to be an attempt to merely whitewash its dismal corporate governance structure  the company still maintains a number of unfriendly stockholder policies including the inability of stockholders to effectively call a special meeting of stockholders given the 0 threshold or act by written consent given the unanimous threshold the inability of stockholders to remove directors without a supermajority vote of rds of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to fill director vacancies even upon removal by stockholders  consider further that not until this year did the company establish a formal nominating and corporate governance committee despite iss recommending withhold votes from directors in each of the last two annual meetings of stockholders for lack of a nominating committee and with respect to richard d machon in  for serving as a nonindependent member of key board committees  iss has noted that the presence of nonindependent directors on key committees may diminish a committees ability to oversee management objectively  clearly this has been the case  we note that if the company had adopted a majority vote standard for the election of directors back in 0 leon kopyt would not have been reelected to the board as  of stockholder withheld their votes from him  furthermore we question the companys last minute appointment of michael es frankel to the board given the long standing track record of its handpicked nominees  no independent director holds meaningful share ownership in the company we believe a culture focused on longterm value creation and stockholder accountability requires placing stockholder representatives on the board who have a significant financial commitment to the company along with relevant experience this requirement ensures the proper alignment of interests between the board and stockholders  based upon our review of the companys public filings we believe as a group the independent members of the board own just over  of the outstanding shares of the company excluding shares underlying stock option grants and similar awards  in fact only one director maier fein has reported open market purchases of the companys shares  we are concerned that the lack of significant actual equity ownership by the independent directors and the minimal real investment dollars they have at risk may contribute to a lack of commitment to maximizing stockholder value  by contrast legion partners and its constituents have invested approximately  million to accumulate approximately  of the companys common stock making it rcms largest investor  we believe our substantial ownership not only results in optimal longterm alignment of interests with stockholders but also demonstrates our motivation to maximize the value of rcm for its stockholders our nominees are truly independent and will act in your best interest roger ballou is an independent nominee with no commercial relationship with the company or legion partners and its constituents bradley vizi has no affiliation with rcm other than his groups  ownership interest our nominees have strong relevant backgrounds are highly regarded in their industries and have the right mix of operating and financial experience to deliver value to all stockholders  both bring unique perspectives and ideas that we believe will aid directly in the realization of value at rcm  both of our nominees are independent directors as defined by the rules of the nasdaq stock market we have no preconceived agenda or aspiration to acquire or otherwise control rcm despite claims made by the board and rcms management team whose iron grip on the company is in jeopardy  not only does the companys claim lack foundation but it also lacks any semblance of precedent  we ask stockholders to disregard the companys distorted chronology and outlandish conspiracy claims as nothing more than a hail mary pass on behalf of the board and management team meant to divert attention away from the serious issues facing the company and the boards long undeniable track record of stockholder neglect and value destruction  we are seeking minority representation on the board in an effort to protect the economic interest of all stockholders which includes our own  million investment in rcm  if our nominees are elected to the board rest assured that they fully understand their fiduciary duties and will represent the interests of all stockholders  if you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares please call our proxy solicitor okapi partners llc whose contact information is
