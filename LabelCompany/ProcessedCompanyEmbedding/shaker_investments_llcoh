investment management shaker investments investment characteristics having identified industries of interest we identify companies of interest within those target industries we evaluate the companies to determine which ones we believe are superior to their competitors and most importantly which ones we believe are superior growth investment candidates in making this evaluation we use a variety of information sources and criteria information sources may include filings by the company meetings with company management contacts with professionals in the same industries meetings and presentations at investment and trade conferences business publications online databases and research obtained from brokerage firms among the evaluation criteria is a group of eleven characteristics developed by shaker that helps determine what we call “fundamental superiority” our eleven characteristics of superior growth companies  demonstrable growth we look for companies in robust industries that have proven their ability to grow faster than similar companies  sustainable competitive advantage it’s not enough for a company to be growing we have to be convinced that it possesses a sufficient competitive advantage which will allow it to continue to excel  dominant market leadership more often than not strong companies get stronger at the expense of the weak we want a company to rank in the top three in market share in its industry segment and to dominate a product or service niche  strong management we spend considerable time talking to management we seek to be convinced that senior managers have formed a coherent team and are collectively prepared to respond to marketplace challenges in a timely and creative manner  a single mission we are most comfortable when management is focused on a single welldefined business  many customers and many different products we prefer a diversified customer base and a multiproduct line so that a company is not left excessively vulnerable to several key buyers or to a limited number of product offerings  consistent development of new products and services we’re attracted to companies that place a significant emphasis on research and development and are consistently bringing innovative products and feature refinements to market  companies that are praised by customers and competitors over time those companies that are recognized by customers as being “the best at meeting their needs” generally prosper far more than companies with less customer focus  positive earnings or cash flow we’re hesitant to invest in a company that depends heavily upon external equity capital to remain in business we seek management teams that are extremely focused on creating a level of earnings andor cash flow that can support ambitious growth plans  conservative financial statements we’re attracted to growth companies that maintain a conservative balance sheet with significant cash positions  significant insider ownership we’re pleased when management owns a significant portion of a company this virtually assures that management’s interests are closely aligned with shareholders’ goals products  expert investment management shaker investments products shaker investments acts as an investment manager for individuals and institutions through custodial accounts with brokers or banks typical accounts include taxable accounts traditional iras roth iras profit sharing of defined benefit plans and trusts we currently offer two longonly model portfolio investment strategies our all cap growth portfolio strategy invests in growth companies over a wide range of market capitalization that includes large more than  billion in market value medium  billion to  billion in market value and small  billion or less in market value capitalization stocks our small cap growth portfolio strategy also invests in growth companies and is focused on the small capitalization end of the equity markets all stocks purchased for our clients trade on us stock exchanges or over the counter although a number of them may be companies headquartered outside of the united states  form adv part iia we start our analysis by considering and analyzing economic and demographic trends because changes in economic conditions and populations strongly influence the prospects of industries and individual companies sasha kostadinov portfolio manager  research analyst all cap growth small cap growth five step approach  expert investment management shaker investments five step approach our ultimate goal is to select for our portfolios companies that we believe have superior businesses are capable of sustaining above market growth rates and whose potential value is not already fully reflected in the company’s stock price our approach combines bottomup fundamental research with macroeconomic and demographic trend analysis to evaluate and choose investments while we do not try to anticipate short term market movements we do consider the trading and investment trends of the market prior to making investment decisions we employ a fivestep strategy when constructing portfolios buying and selling investments evaluating our historical performance and assessing the risks inherent to equity investing our five step approach step  we identify investment themes of potential interest this entails a thorough analysis of short and longterm macroeconomic trends including a topdown economic review demographic factors and industry influences affecting sector growth rates it also involves frequent visits with senior management as well as attendance at trade and brokerage research conferences step  we find superior companies to achieve this we perform further research that measures potential companies for investment against  specified characteristics the criteria for a company to be included in our portfolios are extremely stringent out of the thousands of potential companies for investment in the united states we are looking for only  to  to be in our portfolio at any given time  to  in the small cap step  the third step is to construct a portfolio we continually track  midsized and small us companies that meet our criteria indepth detailed research helps to prevent mistakes and as a result our portfolio turnover is relatively low step  the fourth step is to rebalance the portfolio periodically judicious adjustments can help to manage portfolio risk by limiting overexposure to any one sector or issue step  the fifth step is to give considerable attention to our sell discipline because often the sale of a stock is as important to portfolio performance as the original purchase shaker investments llc  cleveland oh  company information products resources my account talk to a db advisor  business
