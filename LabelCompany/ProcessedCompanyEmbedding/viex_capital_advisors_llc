halt further destruction of stockholder valueurges stockholders to vote gold proxy card to elect richard bloom brian j kelley bradley l radoff joshua e schechter and eric singer news provided by viex capital advisors llc may    et share this article new york may   prnewswire  viex capital advisors llc together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation collectively viex or we collectively the largest stockholder of supportcom inc supportcom or the company nasdaq sprt with ownership of approximately  of the companys outstanding shares announced today that it has issued a letter to supportcom stockholders in connection with its campaign to elect five highlyqualified directors at the companys upcoming annual meeting of stockholders on june   long term destruction of shareholder value under chairman stephens the full text of the letter follows may   dear fellow supportcom stockholder the persistent destruction of stockholder value at supportcom warrants a complete overhaul of the board vote the gold proxy card today to reconstitute supportcoms board with directors committed to representing your best interests viex capital advisors llc together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation collectively viex or we collectively the largest stockholder of supportcom inc supportcom or the company with ownership of approximately  of the companys outstanding shares is dedicated to maximizing value for supportcoms stockholders the true owners of the company as the companys largest stockholder our interests are directly aligned with those of all supportcom stockholders  to maximize the value of the companys stock  since we initiated our campaign to create value for stockholders we have stated both publicly and privately to supportcoms senior management and board of directors the board our concerns with the companys poor stock price performance negative enterprise value and seemingly flawed business strategy despite our efforts to engage constructively with management and the board to tackle these fundamental problems the board and management team have been largely unresponsive and appear more focused on selfpreservation than increasing their accountability to stockholders  in an effort to end the erosion of stockholder value we are therefore seeking your support to reconstitute the board and elect our five highlyqualified independent nominees at the companys annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for june   given the significant destruction of stockholder value that has persisted over the near and long term under the leadership of the incumbent board which now includes three recent additions who were unilaterally appointed without stockholder input it is evident to us that the board must be immediately reconstituted to ensure that the interests of supportcoms stockholders are appropriately represented in the boardroom and that the board takes the necessary steps to help the companys stockholders realize the true value of their investment why change is needed  abysmal total shareholder returns over any relevant measurable period and accumulation of substantial operating losses supportcoms total shareholder returns have been negative over the past one three five and tenyear periods supportcoms stock price declined over  and the company generated approximately  million in operating losses in  yet its ceo and cfo still received substantial cash bonuses over the past ten years supportcom has accumulated over  million of operating losses  boards commitment to a strategy that has been rejected by the market supportcoms stock is down approximately  since the announcement of beta testing of its next generation cloudbased software as a service saas offering nexus supportcom generated over  million in operating income in the fiscal year prior to the announcement of the next generation of nexus – the company has generated cumulative operating losses of more than  million in the two fiscal years since supportcom management projects that the losses will continue in  and   boards defensive  reactionary approach to governance and lack of alignment with stockholders the board has unilaterally taken the following actions that limit stockholders rights since viex sought to maximize stockholder value  adopted a poison pill effectively preventing stockholders from acquiring  or more of the companys outstanding common stock  adopted bylaw amendments making it more difficult and costly for stockholders to nominate directors and bring business before meetings  replaced three incumbent directors without stockholder input the board collectively owns outright less than  of the companys outstanding shares – a minimal vested financial interest in the companys stock price performance  our nominees can restore investor confidence and unlock value for supportcom stockholders our nominees are committed to fully and fairly exploring all strategic alternatives available to the company our nominees interests are aligned with those of all supportcom stockholders and will bring a much needed stockholders perspective to the board the boards failure to engage meaningfully with us in our quest to restore value for supportcom stockholders has left us no choice but to run a proxy contest seeking control of the board to ensure that the company is being operated in a manner consistent with stockholders best interests incessant destruction of stockholder value at supportcom the companys total shareholder returns have been negative over the past one three five and tenyear periods over each such period supportcom has significantly trailed the nasdaq composite index and the nasdaq computer index     supportcom nasdaq composite index nasdaq computer index ytd    year    year    year    year    source bloomberg calculated as of may   rounded to the nearest whole percent in  alone supportcoms stock price declined over  and the company generated approximately  million in operating losses at the same time president and chief executive officer elizabeth cholawsky and chief financial officer roop lakkaraju received cash bonuses of  and  respectively representing approximately  and  of their respective annual base salaries how can the compensation committee chaired by chairman of the board jim stephens justify the payment of such cash bonuses given the companys abysmal performance over the same period in addition over the past ten years supportcom has accumulated over  million of operating losses troublingly supportcom generated operating income in only one fiscal year  during the past decade it is evident to us that the significant destruction of stockholder value that has persisted over the near and long term under the leadership of the incumbent board which now includes three recent additions who were unilaterally appointed without stockholder input warrants a complete overhaul in the boardroom stockholders cannot afford to standby idly as the value of their investment further deteriorates under the current leadership team the board is committed to a strategy that has been rejected by the market since the companys q  earnings call during which chairman stephens who was also interim ceo at the time announced the beta testing of the companys next generation cloudbased software as a service saas offering nexus the companys stock price has declined approximately  indicating that the market has rejected the nexus strategy prior to the companys q  earnings call management had projected that the company would not achieve a breakeven runrate until the end of  under its existing strategy which we did not find particularly encouraging especially considering nexus had already fallen behind projections for example in the companys q  earnings release the company disclosed nexus is on a path to meet the companys  yearend goals of  to  seats and  million in annual recurring revenue the actual results for  were  seats and  in annual recurring revenue given the companys failure to hit projections in the past we question whether the companys revised guidance of expected profitability on a nongaap basis for the full year  represents a sincere belief of management or a hollow promise in the midst of a proxy contest at the same time supportcoms cash balances are being depleted in furtherance of the strategy declining from approximately  million at the end of q  to a newly estimated  million to  million at year end  even based on the companys revised guidance stockholders can expect the cashburn to continue at least until  will there be anything left stockholders deserve representatives who will take action now to seek to restore the value of the company chairman stephens who has served on the board for nearly a decades worth of value destruction is also the chairman of the strategy committee and appears to be the architect of the companys failing nexus strategy we do not believe that a director who has experienced negative total shareholder returns over every relevant measurable period during his tenure should remain on the board let alone be the one shaping the companys strategic direction since mr stephens first became chairman of the board on july   supportcoms stock price has declined   as demonstrated in the chart below over the same time period supportcoms total shareholder returns have significantly trailed the nasdaq composite index and the nasdaq computer index source bloomberg calculated as of may   the board has taken defensive measures to entrench itself and lacks alignment with stockholders during the first week of october viex filed its initial schedule d and publicly stated an intention to engage in discussions with the board regarding means to maximize stockholder value less than ten days later the board unilaterally adopted a poison pill generally preventing stockholders from acquiring  or more of the companys outstanding common stock which has since been terminated and replaced with a section  tax benefits preservation plan effectively preventing stockholders from acquiring  or more of the companys outstanding common stock without board approval the board also subsequently unilaterally adopted numerous amendments to the bylaws including stringent advance notice provisions for valid director nominations and business proposals by stockholders – a thinlyveiled attempt to make it more difficult and costly for stockholders to bring business before meetings we find the boards actions to be selfserving and an improper use of the companys corporate machinery to insulate itself in addition we find it troubling that the board unilaterally replaced three incumbent directors representing half of the members of the board without stockholder input following our repeated efforts to upgrade the board and maximize value for stockholders it is evident to us that the current board has not been interested in proactively and continually adding new talent to the board absent stockholder intervention and we question the ability of the incumbent board to properly identify and select candidates who will contribute to the maximization of stockholder value given the significant value destruction that has occurred under the incumbent boards watch we do note the irony of chairman stephens who we believe is most responsible for the persistent value destruction at supportcom being one of the three directors who were not replaced on the board we are giving stockholders the opportunity to do so now further we believe the boards ineffectiveness at tackling the persistent destruction of stockholder value is in large part a function of a troubling misalignment of interests between the directors and supportcoms stockholders collectively even including the recent purchase made by ceo elizabeth cholawsky on may   the members of the board own outright less than  of the companys outstanding shares even when including all unexercised options and awards that vest within  days the members of the board collectively beneficially own just approximately  of the outstanding shares we believe that the low level of stock ownership by the incumbent board evidences a lack of alignment between their interests and the interests of the companys current stockholders since the board has little skin in the game viex on the other hand owns approximately  of the companys outstanding stock  it seems apparent to us that with so little at personal stake the board does not have the same commitment to stockholder value as we do our nominees are committed to restoring value for supportcoms stockholders our five nominees richard bloom brian j kelley bradley l radoff joshua e schechter and eric singer represent a fresh start for supportcoms stockholders and will bring a much needed stockholders perspective into the boardroom our nominees bring a blend of operating turnaround capital allocation and corporate governance experience and are committed to representing the best interests of the companys stockholders in the boardroom our nominees are committed to establishing a culture of accountability and will fully and fairly evaluate all opportunities to maximize stockholder value viexs nominees are richard bloom has served as a director of nexcore group

“supportcom strives to maintain constructive ongoing communications with all of its stockholders and welcomes and values their input we have been engaged in an ongoing dialogue with viex and other

its investor group since last october we are disappointed they have abandoned our private conversation and are now publicly threatening a costly and distracting proxy contest to replace five out of the six members of our board we believe this is a counterproductive tactic that risks destabilizing the execution of our ongoing initiatives for creating value for all supportcom stockholders “our board is comprised of six highly qualified and very experienced directors five of whom are independent and all of whom are actively engaged in overseeing the execution of supportcom’s strategic plan to drive increased stockholder value creation reflective of our continuing commitment to ensure our board has the right perspectives insights experiences and competencies the nominating and governance committee recently undertook a thorough search process to find additional independent directors who would expand the depth and breadth of the board as a result of that process earlier this year we added elizabeth fetter lowell robinson and tim stanley each of whom replaced a director who resigned from the board ms fetter and messrs robinson and stanley have extensive senior management technology and governance experience and their fresh perspectives and insights will be extremely valuable to the company” the supportcom board will present its formal recommendation regarding director
