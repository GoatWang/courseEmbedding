phosphorylation in the s atp was known to be the energy currency of life but the mechanism by which atp was created in the mitochondria was assumed to be by substratelevel phosphorylation mitchells chemiosmotic hypothesis was the basis for understanding the actual process of oxidative phosphorylation at the time the biochemical mechanism of atp synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation was unknown mitchell realised that the movement of ions across an electrochemical potential difference could provide the energy needed to produce atp his hypothesis was derived from information that was well known in the s he knew that living cells had a membrane potential interior negative to the environment the movement of charged ions across a membrane is thus affected by the electrical forces the attraction of positive to negative charges their movement is also affected by thermodynamic forces the tendency of substances to diffuse from regions of higher concentration he went on to show that atp synthesis was coupled to this electrochemical gradient his hypothesis was confirmed by the discovery of atp synthase a membranebound protein that uses the potential energy of the electrochemical gradient to make atp and by the discovery by andré jagendorf that a ph difference across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast results in atp synthesis protonmotive qcycleedit later peter mitchell

lifeedit mitchell was born in mitcham surrey on  september  his parents were christopher gibbs mitchell a civil servant and kate beatrice dorothy née taplin his uncle was sir godfrey way mitchell chairman of george wimpey he was educated at queens college taunton and jesus college cambridge where he studied the natural sciences tripos specialising in biochemistry he was appointed a research post in the department of biochemistry cambridge in  and was awarded a phd in early  for work on the mode of action of penicillin he was an atheist career and researchedit in  he was invited by professor michael swann to set up a biochemical research unit called the chemical biology unit in the department of zoology at the university of edinburgh where he was appointed a senior lecturer in  then reader in  although ill health led to his resignation in  from  to  he supervised the restoration of a regencyfronted mansion known as glynn house at cardinham near bodmin cornwall  adapting a major part of it for use as a research laboratory he and his former research colleague jennifer moyle founded a charitable company known as glynn research ltd to promote fundamental biological research at glynn house and they embarked on a programme of research on chemiosmotic reactions and reaction systems  chemiosmotic hypothesisedit oxidative phosphorylation in the s atp was known to be the energy currency of life but the mechanism by which atp was created in the mitochondria was assumed to be by substratelevel phosphorylation mitchells chemiosmotic hypothesis was the basis for understanding the actual process of oxidative phosphorylation at the time the biochemical mechanism of atp synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation was unknown mitchell realised that the movement of ions across an electrochemical potential difference could provide the energy needed to produce atp his hypothesis was derived from information that was well known in the s he knew that living cells had a membrane potential interior negative to the environment the movement of charged ions across a membrane is thus affected by the electrical forces the attraction of positive to negative charges their movement is also affected by thermodynamic forces the tendency of substances to diffuse from regions of higher concentration he went on to show that atp synthesis was coupled to this electrochemical gradient his hypothesis was confirmed by the discovery of atp synthase a membranebound protein that uses the potential energy of the electrochemical gradient to make atp and by the discovery by andré jagendorf that a ph difference across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast results in atp synthesis protonmotive qcycleedit later peter mitchell also hypothesized some of the complex details of electron transport chains he conceived of the coupling of proton pumping to quinonebased electron bifurcation which contributes to the proton motive force and thus atp synthesis awards and honoursedit in  he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for his contribution to the understanding of biological energy transfer through the formulation of the chemiosmotic theory he was
