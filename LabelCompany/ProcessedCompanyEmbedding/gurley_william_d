tomography ct scan mri also may show problems that cannot be seen with other imaging methodsultrasoundmagnetic resonance imaging mri is done for many reasons it is used to find problems such as tumors bleeding injury blood vessel diseases or infection mri also may be done to provide more information about a problem seen on an xray ultrasound scan or ct scan contrast material may be used during mri

muscles joints and ligamentsarthroscopyarthroscopy also called arthroscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure on a joint in which an examination and sometimes treatment of damage is performed using anarthroscope an endoscope that is inserted into the joint through a small incision arthroscopic procedures can be performed to evaluate or treat many orthopaedic conditions including torn cartilage known by doctors as meniscus torn surface articular cartilage acl reconstruction and trimming damaged cartilage the advantage over traditional open surgery is that the joint does not have tobe opened upfully for knee arthroscopy only two small incisions are made one for the arthroscope and one for the surgical instruments tobe used in the knee cavity this reduces recovery time and may increase the rate of success due to less trauma to the connective tissue itis especially useful for professional athletes who frequently injure knee joints and require fast healing time there isalso less scarring because of the smaller incisions irrigation fluid is used to distend the joint and make a surgical space sometimes this fluid leaks extravasates into the surrounding soft tissue causing edemawound careankle surgeryjoint replacementtotal joint replacement means replacing both sides of the surface of a joint in the knee it means replacing both the thin cartilage surface on the lower joint surface which is the tibia and the upper joint surface which is the femur also the joint surface under the kneecap is replaced this requires removing the thin cartilage surface and a thin surface of bone for replacement with a metal and plastic surface this allows all movement of the joint to occur between the metal and plastic parts rather than the raw bone left by arthritisorthopedic

joints such as hips knees or shoulders for arthritis or bursitis other problem areas such as tennis elbow trigger finger carpal tunnel syndrome or plantar fasciitis in the foot are common sites for
