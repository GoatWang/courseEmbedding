appraisal markets are constantly fluctuating or changing these fluctuations affect various properties differently because of this constant state of flux there is no allinclusive answer as to how long an appraisal may be considered uptodate whether an appraisal needs to be updated depends on any changes that have occurred in the assets that were already under appraisement and whether the value and premise of value at the time of that appraisal are still pertinent we recommend that an appraisal be reviewed and updated as required at least every year if the business asset or market conditions

of family limited partnership interests llc member interests discounts for lack of control and marketability dlom and dloc fractional equity interests home about us contact us sitemap a discount study is a form of valuation that is generally performed to determine the value of a noncontrolling equity interest minority interest the discount study will also address whether an absence of a market to sell the shares warrants additional discounts to the stocks value marketability lack of control and lack of marketability issues affecting valuation when compared with the value of a majority interest in a public company the value of a minority interest in a privately held company is negatively impacted by both marketability and control issues marketability is defined in the international glossary of business valuation terms as “the ability to quickly convert property to cash at minimal cost” a discount for lack of marketability dlom is “an amount or percentage deducted from the value of an ownership interest to reflect the relative absence of marketability given two identical business interests a higher price will be paid by investors in the market for the business interest that can be converted to cash most rapidly without risk of loss in value an example is publiclytraded stock on the new york stock exchange where the owner can order the sale and the proceeds are deposited in a bank account in three days in the alternative a lesser price is expected for the business interest that cannot be quickly sold and converted to cash a primary concern driving this price reduction is that over the uncertain time frame required to complete the sale the final sale price becomes less certain and with it a decline in value is quite possible accordingly a prudent buyer would want a discount for acquiring such an interest to protect against value loss in a future sale scenario the business valuation committee of the american society of appraisers states a discount for lack of control represents “an amount or percentage deducted from a prorata share of the value of  percent of an equity interest in a business to reflect the absence of some or all of the powers of control” the discount for lack of control is synonymous with the minority interest discount as cited in the third edition of valuing a business by pratt reilly and schweis the lack of control minority interest discount is attributable to the fact that a holder of a member interest generally does not have the power to appoint or change operational management or members of the board of directors determine management compensation and perquisites set operational and strategic policy and change the course of business acquire lease or liquidate assets including plant property and equipment select suppliers vendors and subcontractors with whom to do business and award contracts negotiate and consummate mergers and acquisitions select joint venturers and enter into joint venture and partnership agreements liquidate dissolve sell out or recapitalize the company sell or acquire treasury shares register the company’s equity or debt securities for initial or secondary public offering declare and pay cash andor stock dividends change the articles of incorporation or bylaws set one’s own compensation and perquisites and the compensation and perquisites of relatedparty employee decide what products andor services to offer and how to price those productsservices decide which customer categories to market to and which not to market to enter into inbound and outbound license or sharing agreements regarding intellectual properties block any or all of the above actions in the context of valuation of minority or fractional ownership interests in flp and llc partnerships does appraising family limited partnership interests differ from appraising a business yes because the stock of many businesses are owned by individuals who form partnerships the value of a majority or minority interest in the underlying partnership assets are affected among other variables that affect the partnerships value are size of the interest being appraised restrictions laid out in the family limited partnership or llc operating agreement the historical dividends paid and expected future dividend paying capacity of the entity the historical profitability of the partnership the future outlook of the enterprise the net asset value of the underlying assets etc cambridge partners appraises fractional ownership interests and partnership interests for a variety of purposes including trust and estate planning irs form  returns gifting divorce for buysell agreements joint venture contribution calculation of the minority interest for rollover equity etc   fair market value in performing a discount study valuation of an llc member interest or flp partnership interest a fair market value appraisal must consider the factors listed in internal revenue service rev rul  which specifically includes the nature of the business and the history of the enterprise the economic outlook in general and in particular the outlook for the specific industry of the business the book value of the stock and the financial condition of the business the earnings capacity of the business whether or not the business has goodwill or intangible value prior sales of stock and the size of the block of stock to be valued the market prices of corporations that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the company being appraised and whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market either

brawn intangible assets or intellectual property are the “brainpower that formulates the product or service to be produced whereas the tangible or physical assets are the strength that are actually involved in the product’s production intangible assets fall into four broad categories they are market related customer related contractual and technology related intangibles how to value intangibles assets and intellectual property three primary approaches apply to the valuation of intangible assets the income approach the market comparable approach and the cost approach numerous modifications of these approaches have been developed over the years the value of an intangible may be based on using one or various combinations of these approaches certain events trigger a need for the valuation of intangible assets and intellectual property for example an intangible asset and purchase price allocation appraisal should be performed when accounting for business combinations under asc  gaap and ifrs require the purchase price paid for a company be properly allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values for a transfer pricing study asset valuation irs

determination of intangible assets is required estimating the useful life is important in determining the value generally the longer the life the more valuable the intangible asset for irs federal income tax purposes the remaining useful life determination of intangible assets and intellectual property is as important as the appraisal the internal revenue service allows for the amortization of intangible assets only when the taxpayer establishes that the assets have an ascertainable value separate and distinct from goodwill and have a limited useful life whose duration can be ascertained

hedge funds  pensions  investments investor beware cambridge fraud case spotlights risks in monitoring hedge funds by chris clair · june   john c natales name will forever be linked with hedge fund fraud but in an ironic twist mr natales name also is mentioned when it comes to hedge fund securitymr natale  of long branch nj pleaded guilty in march  to defrauding investors in his red bank njbased cambridge partners lp and cambridge partners ii lp hedge funds of more than  million over eight yearshowever he had a third smaller hedge fund which had less than  million in institutional fundoffunds and wealthy individuals money in it although mr natale tried to transfer assets in that hedge fund to cover his losses in the two larger funds a legal agreement he signed when he listed the smaller hedge fund on plusfundscom ltd prevented him from transferring money out of the plusfunds account related coverage the new rate regime managing income and volatility glass box vs black box ftse russell sets minimum voting rights hurdle that excludes snap inc related the new rate regime managing income and volatility but the success mr natale had siphoning off money from his hedge funds points to weaknesses in hedge fund monitoring said christopher c sugrue chairman of plusfunds ltd which runs the website he said platforms such as plusfunds which list the net asset values and provide realtime risk reporting for various hedge funds are one way investors can protect themselvesbut of the thousands of hedge funds in existence plusfunds lists only  with a combined value of about  million mr sugrue said its really up to investors to protect themselvesstructure outgrownin an industry with very low barriers to participation and now  people providing product a certain number of those will be frauds mr sugrue said the hedge fund business in my opinion has outgrown the structures that were initially sufficient to help it run and organize itself efficientlyin all highprofile hedge fund fraud cost investors close to  billion in  according to published reportsa number of pension funds including the california public employees retirement system sacramento bellsouth corp atlanta the state board of administration of florida tallahassee and the oklahoma firefighters pension  retirement system oklahoma city all are either considering hedge fund investments or have hired hedge fund managersand when they look at hedge funds they and other institutional investors might do well to keep mr natales story in mindbetween 99 when he started the funds and 999 mr natale gathered close to  investors in his cambridge partners and cambridge partners ii hedge funds his investment philosophy was to short internet and technology stocks believing the bull market would soon end as stock prices fell he reasoned his fund  and its investors  would make big gainsbut internet and tech stocks continued to skyrocket and mr natales investors instead lost huge sums of money   within months of starting the funds according to charges filed against mr natale in new jersey superior court in newarkponzi schemerather than let on to his investors mr natale admitted in court to using a ponzi scheme to cover his tracks he used new capital to cash out investors who left the funds and created false audits tax documents and monthly statements to investorsmeanwhile the hedge fund mr natale had set up on the plusfunds platform which hedged largecap domestic stocks and avoided tech stocks was performing well aware of the success of the plusfunds hedge fund mr natale tried taking money from that account and moving it to spear leeds  kellogg new york the prime broker overseeing the cambridge hedge funds to cover his larger losses in those funds mr sugrue saidfor the plusfunds hedge fund mr natale used the bear stearns cos inc new york as prime brokerhedge funds listed on the plusfunds platform are separate but parallel funds mr sugrue said everything can be the same as in the original hedge fund but the manager agrees not to commingle the outside hedge fund money with the money in the plusfunds fund also any assets moved out of the plusfunds hedge fund except for client redemptions must be put into a new plusfunds account  barring mr natale from accessing the plusfunds hedge fund assets mr sugrue saidfinally in midfebruary  after eight years of hiding losses mr natale broke down and turned himself in to the new jersey attorney generals office on march   he pleaded guilty to securities fraud theft by deception and misapplication of entrusted property on feb  of this year new jersey superior court judge joseph falcone sentenced mr natale to  years in prison barred him from working in the securities industry ever again and ordered him to pay  million in restitution mr natale is broke however so investors are unlikely to get their money back said emily j hornaday spokeswoman for the new jersey division of criminal justicefraud like that perpetrated by mr natale and others is on the rise because more money is going into hedge funds and because hedge funds arent closely regulated said thomas fedorek a managing director at the new york
