llcs  corporations starting a business what kind of business should i start starting a restaurant business thinking about starting a restaurant start here for an overview of important legal and financial considerations by david m steingold contributing author share on google plus share on facebook opening a restaurant has its own set of legal considerations these include choosing the proper business entity obtaining licenses and permits dealing with health and safety getting adequate insurance reviewing franchising issues and dealing with employees choosing the business entity while you could operate your restaurant as a sole proprietorship or partnership you should probably consider using a legal form that protects you from personal liability such as a corporation or a limited liability company unlike some other types of business such as certain professional or consulting offices restaurants have a significant number of customers coming through every day and in many cases also a significant number of employees engaged in a lot of physical activity this increases the likelihood that a person could be injured or his or her property damaged on the premises—in which case you would want the business not you personally to be responsible for any liability learn more about choosing a type business structure licenses and permits you will need to obtain a variety of licenses and permits in order to operate your restaurant in some cases such as obtaining a permit for handling food you most likely will need to look to a local government office in other cases such as obtaining a liquor license you will probably need to work with a state agency such as a liquor control commission and if you are thinking of serving liquor in your restaurant keep in mind that the liquor licensing process can be complicated and may require outside legal assistance if your restaurant will be serving large numbers of people you may have crowd control issues and therefore need to obtain a license or permit from a fire or police department similarly you probably will also need a permit or license from a local building department relating to adequacy of exits from the restaurant and related emergency issues health and safety because restaurants are all about people eating food they are subject to significant regulations regarding food health and safety beyond needing to obtain a permit to handle and prepare food you can expect regular monitoring from your local health department local health authorities generally have a lot of latitude regarding what they can inspect and health department inspections can cover a wide array of items in your restaurant inspections may cover not only the food itself raw and prepared but also refrigeration systems cooking equipment and waste disposal among other areas the health and safety of restaurant workers is also an issue the occupational safety  health administration osha has a variety of regulations relating to among other things eye and face protection hand protection and walkingworking surfaces insurance there are particular risks associated with operating a restaurant such as customers or employees slipping and falling on the premises someone getting hurt from hot liquid or broken glass or someone becoming seriously ill from the food itself these are on top of more generic business risks such as fire theft or other sources of property damage or personal injury try to work with an insurance agent who has previous experience writing policies for restaurants for property coverage try to make sure that everything of importance from plates to stoves is fully covered for injuries to people make sure you have an excellent general liability policy this should cover not only a patron who slips at your restaurant’s front door but also one who becomes gravely ill from eating the restaurant’s food and if you do outside catering make sure you have proper vehicle insurance as well for more information see nolos article on obtaining business insurance franchising if you’re thinking of opening a restaurant that is part of a franchise keep in mind that you will have to operate under far more restrictions than if you opened your own independent restaurant you will be subject to a franchise contract which you should expect to favor the franchisor and which likely will give the franchisor rights to decide where other competing restaurants will be located block sale of your franchise to a particular prospective buyer choose the geographic location where any disputes will be resolved and require you to buy all of your goods and services from the franchisor along with the restrictions contained in the franchise contract you should keep in mind the additional financial costs of a franchise in exchange for being given a preexisting business plan getting certain help as needed when running the restaurant and benefitting from group marketing you will be required to pay out a substantial amount of your profit to the franchisor more specifically apart from a large initial franchise fee expect to be required to pay the franchisor a percentage of your profits as a royalty an abovemarket cost for equipment goods and supplies purchased from the franchisor finance charges on those same purchases training fees for you and your employees and contributions to a fund for group advertising if you are considering starting a restaurant as part of a franchise investigate the franchise as thoroughly as you can including reviewing closely the federallyrequired franchise disclosure statement to learn more see nolos article want to buy a franchise ten reasons not to do it employees most restaurants have employees and in many cases there can be relatively frequent turnover particularly among waitstaff bussers and similar positions you should inform yourself about basic employment law issues such as illegal discrimination workers compensation and how to handle the hiring process with regard to hiring in particular learn how to create a useful job application that does not include illegal questions check references or make other preemployment inquiries  again without violating privacy laws or otherwise seeking illegal information and ask interview questions that are both useful and legally permissible keep in mind that there are some employment laws that are specifically relevant to restaurants such as minimum wages for tipped employees a good resource for general employment issues is the employer’s legal handbook by fred steingold nolo also many key employment laws are administered through the department of labor and there are a variety of informative webpages within the department of labor website share on google plus share on facebook talk

morrow college professor how to start a business opening a restaurant by stephanie morrow march  from steakhouses to sub shops more and more restaurants are popping up in cities every day since restaurants are such a common business venture people must enjoy running them how do these benefits sound to you be your own boss have more flexibility and sincerely enjoy what you do not bad however all of those advantages come at a price  building a restaurant from scratch isnt easy its a hard and expensive process and the reality is that many restaurants fail in their first year of business but rest assured there are ways to reduce the risk of becoming another statistic follow some of these handy tips and you too can run a successful food establishment work in a restaurant one of the best ways to reduce the risk of owning a failed restaurant is to have some restaurant experience before you start many successful restaurateurs have said that the best way to prepare for owning a restaurant is by working in one hopefully in an eatery similar to one youd like to open youll learn more than just how to serve food with a smile you can learn restaurant marketing menu development payroll and other significant components of the restaurant world working in the restaurant industry and learning the basics is an important first step to becoming an owner know your target market who do you see eating at your restaurant are you targeting the family crowd teenagers or seniors knowing your target market before you start planning will not only help you solidify your menu it will help determine your location décor and the overall atmosphere of your restaurant a familystyle restaurant which caters to parents and their kids may not appeal to seniors on the other hand an upscale quiet restaurant offering a twohour dining experience wouldnt be appealing to teenagers or families with small children select a service style and food concept what type of restaurant do you see yourself owning one of the first things you must decide is what specific service style you are interested in if you are a morning person you may be more apt to owning a diner specializing in breakfast and brunch on the other hand if you consider yourself a night owl you may prefer an after  pm dinnerbar crowd typically you service style will either be fastfood which offers food types that range from burgers fries hot dogs and sandwiches midscale which has full course meals at value prices or upscale offering full service meals with highclass ambiance and in turn higher prices after narrowing your establishment to one of these three options you can narrow your style of food choices is there a particular type of cuisine that you see yourself serving do you prefer pizza or seafood sandwiches or chinese choosing your food concept goes handinhand with your choice in service style develop a business plan like any other type of company a restaurant will need a concise business plan this plan should include but is not limited to the overall concept and goal of your restaurant specific financial information and projections a description of your target market your menu and pricing equipment and employee details an advertising and marketing plan and a potential exit strategy create a menu the menu can make or break a restaurant and should be in accordance with the overall concept of the restaurant revisit your business plan to make sure the menu is attractive to your target market is affordable within your budget and complements your restaurants design concept for example if your restaurant is familyfriendly you will need a kids menu if you are an upscale establishment a lot of thought will have to go into your wine list choose a location and layout the old saying of location location location is vital in the restaurant world it is important to find a location that has a continuous stream of traffic convenient parking and is in proximity to other businesses especially if youre catering to the lunch crowd and dont forget to revisit your business plan to make sure you are close to your target market if you are opening a restaurantnight club it may not be the best idea to open it in the vicinity of retirement homes in addition make sure your monthly rent is inline with your business plans projected profit so that you do not become buildingpoor once you find your location the layout and design of the interior should be taken into account you should already have a concept of your restaurant in your business plan bring this concept into the design of the dining room when designing your kitchen area think about whats on your menu in order to determine what is needed for the food preparation area get funding your business plan will help you recognize how much money you will need to start your restaurant if you are unsure about how much money you will need upfront talking to other restaurant owners can help you project your expected startup costs there are numerous ways restaurateurs raise capital to start their business including taking advantage of government programs that cater to upstart small business owners liquidating assets or using them as collateral for a loan or encouraging a family or friend to become a partner be familiar with safety regulations restaurants are regulated and subject to inspection and failing to be up to speed with these regulations could be detrimental to your company most regulatory agencies will work with new restaurateurs to help them become familiar with what they must do to meet the necessary legal requirements hire employees one of the biggest challenges restaurants face is a lack of qualified labor in order to get and retain qualified employees make sure your employment ads specifically state what you are looking for in an employee and clearly outline the jobs duties and responsibilities in addition find out what other restaurants are paying their employees so that you can be competitive in the job market without spending too much on payroll     advertise and market as with any business build it and they will come wont have customers breaking down your door every business needs a

most states you start a sole proprietorship by filing an assumed name certificate also called a doing business as certificate with your county clerks office for under  filing a certificate of formation for an llc is done through the secretary of states office and most states do not charge more than  liabilities since a sole proprietorship is not a separate legal entity if your restaurant is not able to pay its debts your creditors can come after your personal property assets such as your car home and personal savings are at risk if your restaurant is run as an llc you are not personally responsible for business debt unless you sign a guarantee that says so this means creditors can only gain access to your business savings and assets but not your personal property in the

part of your personal income tax return other business forms such as corporations are taxed on profits as a business and then the owners are taxed on their share of the income from the business irs
