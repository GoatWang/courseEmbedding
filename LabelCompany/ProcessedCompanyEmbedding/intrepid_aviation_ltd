underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares assuming an initial public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us each  increase decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of  per share would increase decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately  million assuming the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us each increase decrease of  million in the number of shares we are offering would increase decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us by approximately  million assuming the assumed initial public offering price stays the same we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to continue to purchase aircraft and for general corporate purposes to support continued growth our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above we may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes accordingly our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering the leasing and remarketing of commercial passenger aircraft is highly competitive we face competition from airlines aircraft manufacturers other aircraft leasing companies financial institutions aircraft brokers special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring leasing and selling aircraft and public and private partnerships investors and funds including private equity firms and hedge funds competition for leasing transactions is based on a number of factors including delivery dates lease rates lease terms aircraft condition and the availability in the marketplace of the types of aircraft to meet the needs of the airline customers our publicly listed competitors include aercap holdings nv air lease corporation aircastle limited boc aviation ltd and fly leasing limited company description we are a global leasing company that acquires and leases primarily passenger aircraft to a diverse group of airlines throughout the world we lease primarily young modern fuelefficient twinengine widebody passenger aircraft and larger narrowbody passenger aircraft we intend to expand our fleet mix by acquiring aircraft that are currently in widespread use are indemand with airlines and that we expect will have long useful lives our strategy is to enter into longterm leases typically with initial terms ranging from ten to twelve years for widebody passenger aircraft and six to ten years for larger narrowbody passenger aircraft with wellestablished airlines while seeking to maximize longterm earnings growth and to generate attractive returns through the economic cycle all of our leases are denominated in us dollars and are “triplenet” operating leases which means that the lessee is required to pay for all maintenance and overhaul refurbishment insurance taxes and all other aircraft operating expenses during the lease term our owned and committed portfolio includes twinengine widebody passenger aircraft such as the airbus a airbus a boeing er and boeing  dreamliner as well as the airbus a narrowbody passenger aircraft and the boeing f freighter aircraft as of december   we owned  aircraft which had an aggregate book value of  billion our owned aircraft as of december   have an average age of  years and our aircraft on lease have an average remaining lease term of  years the average remaining lease term excludes six owned aircraft that are subject to fully executed leases with turkish airlines as of december   weighted by net book value metrics noted as “weighted by net book value” are an average resulting from the multiplication of each metric by the dollar book value of an aircraft to reflect its relative importance historically we relied predominantly on forwardorder aircraft from original equipment manufacturers “oems” to facilitate our growth as of december   we had commitments to purchase four new aircraft directly from boeing with an aggregate purchase value of  billion at list price subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions in addition our ability to acquire these aircraft will also depend on our ability to secure adequate financing our business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue earnings and cash flows we target lessees that we believe will attract better lease terms including higher lease rates longer lease durations and higher lease renewal rates which drive profitability and reduce residual value risk we fund the acquisition of our aircraft primarily with longterm secured credit facilities that are either fixed rate or synthetically fixed using interest rate swaps with maturities that generally match those of our leases to mitigate our interest rate and refinancing risk as of december   our owned aircraft have been placed on lease with a diverse group of  airline customers in  different countries our customers are wellestablished airlines or flag carriers some of which are majority owned by governments and our aircraft are typically used on what we believe are key international or longhaul routes for our customers we will continue to diversify our portfolio by asset type oem customer base and region we will continue to focus on markets with the greatest growth in demand for air travel

estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of common shares in this offering will be approximately  million or  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares assuming an initial public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and after deducting the estimated

net proceeds to us from this offering after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us by approximately  million assuming the assumed initial public offering price stays the same we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to continue to purchase aircraft and for general corporate purposes to support continued growth our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above we may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes accordingly our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering the leasing and remarketing of commercial passenger aircraft is highly competitive we face competition from airlines aircraft manufacturers other aircraft leasing companies financial institutions aircraft brokers special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring leasing and selling aircraft and public and private partnerships investors and funds including private equity firms and hedge funds competition for leasing transactions is based on a number of factors including delivery dates lease rates lease terms aircraft condition and the availability in the marketplace of the types of aircraft to meet the needs of the airline customers our publicly listed competitors include aercap holdings nv air lease corporation aircastle limited boc aviation ltd and fly leasing limited company description we are a global leasing company that acquires and leases primarily passenger aircraft to a diverse group of airlines throughout the world we lease primarily young modern fuelefficient twinengine widebody passenger aircraft and larger narrowbody passenger aircraft we intend to expand our fleet mix by acquiring aircraft that are currently in widespread use are indemand with airlines and that we expect will have long useful lives our strategy is to enter into longterm leases typically with initial terms ranging from ten to twelve years for widebody passenger aircraft and six to ten years for larger narrowbody passenger aircraft with wellestablished airlines while seeking to maximize longterm earnings growth and to generate attractive returns through the economic cycle all of our leases are denominated in us dollars and are “triplenet” operating leases which means that the lessee is required to pay for all maintenance and overhaul refurbishment insurance taxes and all other aircraft operating expenses during the lease term our owned and committed portfolio includes twinengine widebody passenger aircraft such as the airbus a airbus a boeing er and boeing  dreamliner as well as the airbus a narrowbody passenger aircraft and the boeing f freighter aircraft as of december   we owned  aircraft which had an aggregate book value of  billion our owned aircraft as of december   have an average age of  years and our aircraft on lease have an average remaining lease term of  years the average remaining lease term excludes six owned aircraft that are subject to fully executed leases with turkish airlines as of december   weighted by net book value metrics noted as “weighted by net book value” are an average resulting from the multiplication of each metric by the dollar book value of an aircraft to reflect its relative importance historically we relied predominantly on forwardorder aircraft from original equipment manufacturers “oems” to facilitate our growth as of december   we had commitments to purchase four new aircraft directly from boeing with an aggregate purchase value of  billion at list price subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions in addition our ability to acquire these aircraft will also depend on our ability to secure adequate financing our business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue earnings and cash flows we target lessees that we believe will attract better lease terms including higher lease rates longer lease durations and higher lease renewal rates which drive profitability and reduce residual value risk we fund the acquisition of our aircraft primarily with longterm secured credit facilities that are either fixed rate or synthetically fixed using interest rate swaps with maturities that generally match those of our leases to mitigate our interest rate and refinancing risk as of december   our owned aircraft have been placed on lease with a diverse group of  airline customers in  different countries our customers are wellestablished airlines or flag carriers some of which are majority owned by governments and our aircraft are typically used on what we believe are key international or longhaul routes for our customers we will continue to diversify our portfolio by asset type oem customer
