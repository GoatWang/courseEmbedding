jewelers new ceo has her work cut out by sarah halzack photographer scott eells consumer sarah halzack sarah halzack is a bloomberg gadfly columnist covering the consumer and retail industries she was previously a national retail reporter for the washington post follow sarahhalzack facebook twitter email print share july    pm edt signet jewelers ltd  as of  am edt  usd signet jewelers ltd the corporate parent of kay jewelers and zales has lost much of its sparkle in the past couple of yearsthe company on monday took an important step toward reclaiming it naming a new ceo virginia c drosos she will replace mark light who had held the top job since  but whose career at signet spanned more than  years the company said light is retiring due to health reasonsthe change is a potentially pivotal shakeup for a company that badly needs onelast year signet faced allegations it was systematically swapping diamonds from jewelry brought into its stores for repair sending customers home with cheaper stones than they had originally purchased though the company has strongly denied these claims the accusations still pingponged around social media and likely bruised its reputationand sworn statements in an arbitration case released earlier this year show light has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior toward female employees this claim was unearthed in a classaction case in which hundreds of former workers said there was a pattern of sexual misconduct at the company signet has denied wrongdoingreplacing light is an effective way for signet to show employees and investors it wants to move forward and is serious about fixing a troubling workplace cultureits also an opportunity to bring fresh eyes to a business that clearly needs new direction a notsoshiny object signets stock has tumbled in the past year source bloomberg signets stock has been slammed this year partly because investors are likely squeamish about its ability to ride out the scandals but distress in its core jewelry businesses has contributed too from bad to worse signets comparable sales have been declining source bloomberg signets sales have been battered by several problems it is saddled with a huge fleet of stores many of which are in malls where foot traffic is sliding and other tenants are failing or fleeing the company has said a steady stream of deep discounts by its competitors has put it in a tough spot signet can either watch customers flock to rivals offering eyepopping prices or it can join the fray and watch margins sufferand the company doesnt exactly have its foot on the gas in its digital business sales in that channel rose just  percent in the first quarter from a year earlier a paltry increase in what should be a highgrowth areasignets q online sales growthit is true jewelry is more insulated from the rise of online retailing than say clothing or electronics engagementring shoppers are typically making one of the most personal and highticket purchases theyll ever make it stands to reason many of them want to see the goods in personbut with blue nile inc aggressively pursuing the digital corner of the market it is still important for signet to do more to position itself as a serious player thereit remains to be seen whether drosos is the right choice to shine up the jewelry behemoth she has plenty of experience in the consumer sector having spent more than  years at the procter  gamble co but it is unclear how that résumé will translate into selling bling peddling pantry staples and personalcare items is more about edging out competition with attractive prices and finding ways to make a habit of buying a given productkay zales and signets other jewelry chains are a very different kind of business signet is not a retailing empire built on amassing a base of frequent regular shoppers but one that relies heavily on customer service and the creation of an aspirational instore experiencestill drosos has been on signets board of directors since  and she has served on its subcommittee focused on customer experience that should help her hit the ground running its a good thing too because signet needs help right away this column does not

follow sarahhalzack facebook twitter email print share july    pm edt signet jewelers ltd  as of  am edt  usd signet jewelers ltd the corporate parent of kay jewelers and zales has lost much of its sparkle in the past couple of yearsthe company on monday took an important step toward reclaiming it naming a new ceo virginia c drosos she will replace mark light who had held the top job since  but whose career at signet spanned more than  years the company said light is retiring due to health reasonsthe change is a potentially pivotal shakeup for a company that badly needs onelast year signet faced allegations it was systematically swapping diamonds from jewelry brought into its stores for repair sending customers home with cheaper stones than they had originally purchased though the company has strongly denied these claims the accusations still pingponged around social media and likely bruised its reputationand sworn statements in an arbitration case released earlier this year show light has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior toward female employees this claim was unearthed in a classaction case in which hundreds of former workers said there was a pattern of sexual misconduct at the company signet has denied wrongdoingreplacing light is an effective way for signet to show employees and investors it wants to move forward and is serious about fixing a troubling workplace cultureits also an opportunity to bring fresh eyes to a business that clearly needs new direction a notsoshiny object signets stock has tumbled in the past year source bloomberg signets stock has been slammed this year partly because investors are likely squeamish about its ability to ride out the scandals but distress in its core jewelry businesses has contributed too from bad to worse signets comparable sales have been declining source bloomberg signets sales have been battered by several problems it is saddled with a huge fleet of stores many of which are in malls where foot traffic is sliding and other tenants are failing or fleeing the company has said a steady stream of deep discounts by its competitors has put it in a tough spot signet can either watch customers flock to rivals offering eyepopping prices or it can join the fray and watch margins sufferand the company doesnt exactly have its foot on the gas in its digital business sales in that channel rose just  percent in the first quarter from a year earlier a paltry increase in what should be a highgrowth areasignets q online sales growthit is true jewelry is more insulated from the rise of online retailing than say clothing or electronics engagementring shoppers are typically making one of the most personal and highticket purchases theyll ever make it stands to reason many of them want to see the goods in personbut with blue nile inc aggressively pursuing the digital corner of the market it is still important for signet to do more to position itself as a serious player thereit remains to be seen whether drosos is the right choice to shine up the jewelry behemoth she has plenty of experience in the consumer sector having spent more than  years at the procter  gamble co but it is unclear how that résumé will translate into selling bling peddling pantry staples and personalcare items is more about edging out competition with attractive prices and finding ways to make a habit of buying a given productkay zales and signets other jewelry chains are a very different kind of business signet is not a retailing empire built on amassing a base of frequent regular shoppers but one that relies heavily on customer service and the creation of an aspirational instore experiencestill drosos has been on signets board of directors since  and she has served on its subcommittee focused on customer experience that should help her hit the ground running its a good thing too because signet needs help right away this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of bloomberg

on twitter share on facebook share on linkedin share on google virginia drosos takes over at signet which lags rivals online and is battling sales declines and reputation challenges bloomberg gadfly—signet jewelers ltd the corporate parent of kay jewelers and zales has lost much of its sparkle in the past couple of years virginia drosos ceo signet jewelers the company on monday took an important step toward reclaiming it naming a new ceo virginia drosos she will replace mark light who had held the top job since  but whose career at signet spanned more than  years the company said light is retiring july  “due to health reasons” the change is a potentially pivotal shakeup for a company that badly needs one last year signet faced allegations it was systematically swapping diamonds from jewelry brought into its stores for repair sending customers home with cheaper stones than they had originally purchased though the company has strongly denied these claims the accusations still pingponged around social media and likely bruised its reputation signet is no  in the internet retailer  top  advertisement   news technical problems cost signet in q matt lindner  mar   and sworn statements in an arbitration case released earlier this year show light has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior toward female employees this claim was unearthed in a classaction case in which hundreds of former workers said there was a pattern of sexual misconduct at the company signet has denied wrongdoing replacing light is an effective way for signet to show employees and investors it wants to move forward and is serious about fixing a troubling workplace culture news tiffany’s new ceo is tasked with putting the sparkle back in jewelry sales bloomberg news  jul   it’s also an opportunity to bring fresh eyes to a business that clearly needs new direction signet’s stock has been slammed this year partly because investors are likely squeamish about its ability to ride out the scandals but distress in its core jewelry businesses has contributed too advertisement signet’s sales have been battered by several problems it is saddled with a huge fleet of stores many of which are in malls where foot traffic is sliding and other tenants are failing or fleeing the company has said a steady stream of deep discounts by its competitors has put it in a tough spot signet can either watch customers flock to rivals offering eyepopping prices or it can join the fray and watch margins suffer and the company doesn’t exactly have its foot on the gas in its digital business sales in that channel rose just  in the first quarter from a year earlier a paltry increase in what should be a highgrowth area it is true jewelry is more insulated from the rise of online retailing than say clothing or electronics engagementring shoppers are typically making one of the most personal and highticket purchases they’ll ever make it stands to reason many of them want to see the goods in person but with blue nile inc no  aggressively pursuing the digital corner of the market it is still important for signet to do more to position itself as a serious player there it remains to be seen whether drosos is the right choice to shine up the jewelry behemoth she has plenty of experience in the consumer sector having spent more than  years at the procter  gamble co but it is unclear how that resume will translate into selling bling peddling pantry staples and personalcare items is more about edging out competition with attractive prices and finding ways to make a habit of buying a given product advertisement kay zales and signet’s other jewelry chains are a very different kind of business signet is not a retailing empire built on amassing a base of frequent regular shoppers but one that relies heavily on customer service and the creation of an aspirational instore experience still drosos has been on signet’s board of directors since  and she has served on its subcommittee focused on customer experience that should help her hit the ground running it’s a good thing too because signet needs help right away this column does not necessarily reflect the
