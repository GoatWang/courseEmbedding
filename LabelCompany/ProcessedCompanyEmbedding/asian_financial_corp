a major source of scientific innovations yet fails to be fully recognized as a developed nation asias developmenthistorically while the asian markets have had stock exchanges for more than  years they did not rise to prominence until after world war ii japan set the pace with protectionist policies and a strong centralgovernmentled development effort that turned the country into an exporting powerhouse in time its neighbors soon took notice of the trend a host of other nations including hong kong singapore south korea taiwan vietnam thailand india and china began a period of rapid industrialization in the early s that continued through the st century these nations entered the global marketplace by exporting massproduced products and then over time many of them evolved their efforts to enter the hightech arena with the injection of large amounts of foreign investment capital the asian tiger economies grew substantially between the late s and early to mids crossindustry growth continued until  when asia was struck with the financial crisis the main cause of the asian financial crisis was the collapse of the thai baht which was ineffectively pegged to the us dollar as thailand accumulated an excessive debt burden although many other regions such as china were less affected asias economic growth experienced major setbacks since the late s these economies have recovered korea is a prime example of a country that emerged from the turmoil to become a dominant player in international markets as the country has become a technology powerhouse with a high

markets particularly within developing economies are still generally less mature and less regulated than markets in america or europe bond markets in particular are often underdeveloped as bank financing is much more common than financing via the issuance of corporate debt on the equity side asian markets are less likely to do the same type of capital restructuring that is common in america with leveraged buyouts and similar maneuvers being exceptions rather than the rule the wide variety of financial products available through retail banks is also more common in developed countries outside asia regulatory reforms in asian financial markets also lag western markets and political factors can play a role particularly in less developed economies where government intervention can be heavy the operating differences and regulatory differences all serve as reminders of the need for investors to conduct research and give careful consideration to any investment before adding it to their portfolios asian flavor for your portfolio at the end of  the asian economies were still booming china south korea thailand indonesia and malaysia are exporting powerhouses gross domestic

through the tiger economies of se asian over the previous decade the se asian states of thailand malaysia singapore indonesia hong kong and south korea had registered some of the most impressive economic growth rates in the world their economies had expanded by  to  per annum compounded as measured by gross domestic product this asian miracle however appeared to come to an abrupt end in late  when in one country after another local stock markets and currency markets imploded when the dust started to settle in january  the stock markets in many of these states had lost over  of their value their currencies had depreciated against the us dollar by a similar amount and the once proud leaders of these nations had been forced to go cap in hand to the international monetary fund imf to beg for a massive financial assistance this section explains why this happen and explores the possible consequences both for the world economy and for international businesses background the seeds of the  asian financial crisis were sown during the previous decade when these countries were experiencing unprecedented economic growth although there were and remain important differences between the individual countries a number of elements were common too most exports had long been the engine of economic growth in these countries a combination of inexpensive and relatively well educated labor export oriented economies falling barriers to international trade and in some cases such as malaysia heavy inward investment by foreign companies had combined during the previous quarter of a century to transform many asian states into export powerhouses over the  period for example the value of exports from malaysia had grown by  per year thai exports had grown by  per year singapore�s by  per year hong kong�s by  per year and those of south korea and indonesia by  per year the nature of these exports had also shifted in recent years from basic materials and products such as textiles to complex and increasingly high technology products such as automobiles semiconductors and consumer electronics an investment boom the wealth created by export led growth helped to fuel an investment boom in commercial and residential property industrial assets and infrastructure the value of commercial and residential real estate in cities such as hong kong and bangkok started to soar in turn this fed a building boom the likes of which had never been seen before in asia office and apartment building were going up all over the region heavy borrowing from banks financed much of this construction but so long as the value of property continued to rise the banks were more than happy to lend as for industrial assets the continued success of asian exporters encouraged them to make ever bolder investments in industrial capacity this was exemplified most clearly by south korea�s giant diversified conglomerates or chaebol many of which had ambitions to build up a major position in the global automobile and semiconductor industries an added factor behind the investment boom in most se asian economies was the government in many cases the government had embarked upon huge infrastructure projects in malaysia for example a new government administrative center was been constructed in putrajaya for m billion us billion at the pre july  exchange rate the government was funding the development of a massive high technology communications corridor and the huge bakun dam which at a cost of m billion was to be the most expensive power generation scheme in the country throughout the region governments also encouraged private businesses to invest in certain sectors of the economy in accordance with national goals and industrialization strategy in south korea long a country where the government played a proactive role in private sector investments president kim youngsam urged the chaebol to invest in new factories mr kim a populist politician took office in  during a mild recession and promised to boost economic growth by encouraging investment in export oriented industries korea did enjoyed an investment led economic boom in the  period but at a cost the chaebol always reliant on heavy borrowings built up massive debts that were equivalent on average to four times their equity in malaysia the government had encouraged strategic investments in the semiconductor and automobile industries in accordance with the korean model one result of this was the national automobile manufacturer perusahaan otomobil nasional bhd which was established in  protected by a  import tariff and with few other competitors the proton as the car was dubbed sold well in its captive market by  perusahaan otomobil nasional bhd was selling  cars out of a total market of  by  it had a  share of a market which had grown to  cars annually whether this company could succeed in a competitive marketplace however was another question skeptical analysis note that in  an average cc proton cost about three times per capita income in malaysia by  a cc proton costs  times per capita income � hardly what one would expect from an efficient enterprise in indonesia president suharato has long supported investments in a network of an estimated  businesses that are owned by his family and friends in a system known as crony capitalism many of these businesses have been granted lucrative monopolies by the president for example in  one the president�s youngest son mr hutomo was granted a monopoly on the sale of cloves which are mixed with tobacco in the cigarettes preferred by  out of  smokers in indonesia in another example in  suharato announced that he had decided to build a national car and that the car would be built by a company owned by mr hutomo in association with kia motors of south korea to support the venture a consortium of indonesian banks was ordered by the government to offer almost  million in startup loans to the company in sum by the mid s se asia was in the grips of an unprecedented investment boom much of it financed with borrowed money between  and  gross domestic investment grew by  per annum in indonesia  per annum in malaysia  in thailand and  per annum in south korea by comparison investment grew by  per annum over the same period in the us and  per annum in all high income economies moreover the rate of investment accelerated in  in malaysia for example spending on investment accounted for a remarkable  of gdp in  excess capacity as might be expected as the volume of investments ballooned during the s often at the bequest of national governments so the quality of many of these investments declined significantly all too often the investments were made on the basis of projections about future demand conditions that were unrealistic the result was the emergence of significant excess capacity a case in point were investments made by korean chaebol in semiconductor factories investments in such facilities surged in  and  when a temporary global shortage of dynamic random access memory chips drams led to sharp price increases for this product however by  supply shortages had disappeared and excess capacity was beginning to make itself felt just as the koreans started to bring new dram factories on stream the results were predictable prices for drams plunged through the floor and the earnings of korean dram manufacturers fell by  which meant it was extremely difficult for them to make scheduled payments on the debt they had taken on to build the extra capacity in the first place in another example a building boom in thailand resulted in the emergence of excess capacity in residential and commercial property by early  it was estimated that there were  apartment units unoccupied in bangkok with another  units scheduled to be completed in  it was clear that years of excess demand in the thai property market had been replaced by excess supply by one estimate by  bangkok�s building boom had produced enough excess space to meet its residential and commercial need for at least five years the debt bomb by early  what was happening in the korean semiconductor industry and the bangkok property market was being played out elsewhere in the region massive investments in industrial assets and property had created a situation of excess capacity and plunging prices while leaving the companies that had made the investments groaning under huge debt burdens that they were now finding difficult to service to make matters worse much of the borrowing to fund these investments had been in us dollars as opposed to local currencies at the time this had seemed like a smart move throughout the region local currencies were pegged to the dollar and interest rates on dollar borrowings were generally lower than rates on borrowings in domestic currency thus it often made economic sense to borrow in dollars if the option was available however if the governments in the region could not maintain the dollar peg and their currencies started to depreciate against the dollar this would increase the size of the debt burden that local companies would have to service when measured in the local currency currency depreciation in other words would raise borrowing costs and could result in companies defaulting on their debt payments in this regard a final complicating factor was that by the mid s although exports were still expanding across the region so were imports the investments in infrastructure industrial capacity and commercial real estate were sucking in foreign goods at unprecedented rates to build infrastructure factories and office buildings se asian countries were purchasing capital equipment and materials from america europe and japan boeing and airbus were crowing about the number of commercial jet aircraft they were selling to asian airlines semiconductor equipment companies such as applied materials and lam materials were boasting about the huge orders they were receiving from asia motorola nokia and ericsson were falling over themselves to sell wireless telecommunications equipment to asian nations and companies selling electric power generation equipment such as abb and general electric were booking record orders across the region reflecting growing imports many se asian states saw the current account of their balance of payments shift strongly into the red during the mid s by  indonesia was running a current account deficit that was equivalent to  of its gross domestic product gdp malaysia�s was  and thailand�s was  with deficits like these starting to pile up it was becoming increasingly difficult for the governments of these countries to maintain the peg of their currencies against the us dollar if that peg could not be held the local currency value of dollar dominated debt would increase raising the specter of large scale default on debt service payments the scene was now set for a potentially rapid economic meltdown meltdown in thailand the asian meltdown began on february th  in thailand that was the date that somprasong land a thai property developer announced that it had failed to make a scheduled  million interest payment on an  billion eurobond loan effectively entering into defaulting somprasong land was the first victim of speculative overbuilding in the bangkok property market the thai stock market had already declined by  since its high in early  primarily on concerns that several property companies might be forced into bankruptcy now one had been the stock market fell another  on the news but it was only the beginning in the aftermath of somprasong�s default it became clear that not only were several other property developers teetering on the brink on default so where many of the country�s financial institutions including finance one the country�s largest financial institution finance one had pioneered a practice that had become widespread among thai institutions  issuing eurobonds denominated in us dollars and using the proceeds to finance lending to the country�s booming property developers in theory this practice made sense because finance one was able to exploit the interest rate differential between dollar denominated debt and thai debt ie finance one borrowed in us dollars at a low interest rate and leant in thai bhat at high interest rates the only problem with this financing strategy was that when the thai property market began to unravel in  and  the property developers could no longer payback the cash that they had borrowed from finance one in turn this made it difficult for finance one to pay back its creditors as the effects of overbuilding became evident in  finance one�s nonperforming loans doubled then doubled again in the first quarter of  in february  trading in the shares of finance one was suspended while the government tried to arrange for the troubled company to be acquired by a small thai bank in a deal sponsored by the thai central bank it didn�t work and when trading resumed in finance one shares in may they fell  in a single day by this time it was clear that bad loans in the thai property market were swelling daily and had risen to over  billion finance one was bankrupt and it was feared that others would follow it was at this point that currency traders began a concerted attack on the thai currency the baht for the previous  years the thai baht had been pegged to the us dollar at an exchange rate of around bt this peg however had become increasingly difficult to defend currency traders looking at thailand�s growing current account deficit and dollar denominated debt burden reasoned that demand for dollars in thailand would rise while demand for baht would fall businesses and financial institutions would be exchanging baht for dollars to service their debt payments and purchase imports there were several attempts to force a devaluation of the baht in late  and early  these speculative attacks typical involved traders selling baht short in order to profit from a future decline in the value of the baht against the dollar in this context short selling involves a currency trader borrowing baht from a financial institution and immediately reselling those baht in the foreign exchange market for dollars the theory here is that if the value of the baht subsequently falls against the dollar then when the trader has to buy the baht back to repay the financial institution it will cost her less dollars than she received from the initial sale of baht for example a trader might borrow bt from a bank for a period of six months the trader then exchanges the bt for  at an exchange rate of bt if the exchange rate subsequently declines to bt it will only cost the trader  to repurchase the bt in six months and pay back the bank leaving the trader with a  profit of course since short selling involves selling baht for dollars if enough traders engage in this practice it can become a selffulfilling prophecy in may  short sellers were swarming over the thai baht in an attempt to defend the peg the thai government used its foreign exchange reserves which were denominated in us dollars to purchase thai baht it cost the thai government  billion to defend the baht which reduced its officially reported foreign exchange reserves to a twoyear low of  billion in addition the thai government raised key interest rates from  to  to make holding baht more attractive but since this also raised corporate borrowing costs it only served to exacerbate the debt crisis what the world financial community did not know at this point was that with the blessing of his superiors a foreign exchange trader at the thai central bank had locked up most of thailand�s foreign exchange reserves in forward contracts the reality was that thailand only had  billion in available foreign exchange reserves left to defend the dollar peg defending the peg was clearly now impossible on july nd  the thai government bowed to the inevitable and announced that they would allow the baht to float freely against the dollar the baht immediately lost  of its value and started a slide that would bring the exchange rate down to bt by january  as the baht declined so the thai debt bomb exploded put simply a  decline in the value of the baht against the dollar doubled the amount of baht required to serve the dollar denominated debt commitments taken on by thai financial institutions and businesses this made more bankruptcies such as finance one all further pushed down the battered thai stock market the thailand set stock market index ultimately declined from  in january  to a low of  in december of that year and this on top of a  decline in  on july th the thai government took the next logical step and called in the international monetary fund imf with its foreign exchange reserves depleted thailand lacked the foreign currency needed to finance its international trade and service debt commitments and was in desperate need of the capital the imf could provide moreover it desperately needed to restore international confidence in its currency and needed the credibility associated with gaining access to imf funds without imf loans it was likely that the baht would increase its freefall against the us dollar and the whole country might go into default imf loans however come with tight strings attached the imf agreed to provide the thai government with  billion in loans but the conditions were restrictive the imf required the thai government to increase taxes cut public spending privatize several state owned businesses and raise interest rates � all steps designed to cool thailand�s overheated economy furthermore the imf required thailand to close illiquid financial institutions in the event in december  the government shut some  financial institutions laying off  people in the process and further deepening the recession that now gripped the country the domino effect following the devaluation of the thai baht wave after wave of speculation hit other asian currencies one after another in a period of weeks the malaysian ringgit indonesian rupiah and the singapore dollar were all marked sharply lower with its foreign exchange reserves down to  billion malaysia let its currency the ringgit float on july th  prior to the devaluation the ringgit was trading at  ringgit six months later it had declined to  ringgit singapore followed on july th and the singapore dollar s quickly dropped in value from s prior to the devaluation to s a few days later next up was indonesia whose currency the rupiah was allowed to float on august th for indonesia this was the beginning of a precipitous decline in the value of its currency which was to fall from  rupiah in august  to  on january th  a loss of  with the exception of singapore whose economy is probably the most stable in the region these devaluations were driven by similar factors to those that underlay the earlier devaluation of the thai baht a combination of excess investment high borrowings much of it in dollar denominated debt and a deteriorating balance of payments position the leaders of these countries however were not always quick to acknowledge the home grown nature of their problems malaysia as the ringgit declined against the us dollar the malaysia�s prime minister dr mahathir mohammed gave speeches asserting that the international financier george soros was the arch villain in a conspiracy to impoverish southeast asian nations by attacking their currencies according to dr mahathir foreign fund managers were selling malaysian shares because they were racists currency traders were ignoring malaysia�s sound economic fundamentals the west was gloating over the crisis in se asia rumor mongers who should be shot were spreading lies and a jewish agenda was at work against the country unfortunately for dr mahathir every time he gave free rein to his thoughts on the matter the malaysian currency and stock market declined even further he even tried to outlaw short selling on the malaysian stock market but this too had the opposite effect of that intended and the policy had to be pulled shortly after it was introduced by autumn malaysia�s government seems to have come around to the view that it needed to put its own house in order rather than blame others for its problems in early september the government deferred spending on several high profile infrastructure projects including its prestigious bakun dam project this was followed in december  by the release of plans to cut state spending by  the government also stated that it will not bail out any corporations that become insolvent as a result of excess borrowing then in january  imf managing director michel camdessus stated that malaysia was correct in asserting that it did not need an imf rescue package to get it through the regional financial crisis malaysia is not facing a crisis in the same way as some of the other countries in the region  he said noting the authorities have taken measures to deal with the difficulties particularly on the fiscal side on the other hand he did state that the government needed to raise interest rates to slow credit growth moderate inflationary pressures and support the weakening currency indonesia indonesia authorities also initially respond with something less than full commitment to that country�s financial crisis following speculative selling the indonesia currency the rupiah was uncoupled from its dollar peg and allowed to float on august th  the rupiah immediately started to decline as did the indonesian stock market by october the rupiah had dropped from rp in early august to rp and the jakarta stock market index had declined from just over  to under  at this point the now desperate indonesian government turned to the imf for financial assistance after several weeks of intense negotiations on october st the imf announced that in conjunction with the world bank and the asian development bank it had put together a  billion rescue deal for indonesia in return the indonesian government agreed to close a number of troubled banks to reduce public spending balance the budget and unravel the crony capitalism that was so widespread in indonesia the initial response to the imf deal was favorable with the rupiah strengthening to rp however the recovery was short lived as november lengthened so the rupiah resumed its decline in response to growing skepticism about president suharto�s willingness to take the tough steps required by the imf moreover currency traders wondered how indonesia was going to be able to deal with its dollar denominated private sector debt which stood at  billion with both the economy and exchange rate collapsing there was clearly no way that private sector enterprises would be able to generate the rupiah required to purchase the dollars needed to service the debt and so the decline feed on itself in december moody�s the us credit rating agency feed fuel to this fire when it downgraded indonesia�s credit rating to junk bond status on january th  president suharto seemed to confirm the skepticism of currency traders when he unveiled indonesia�s  budget the budget immediately came in for criticism because it made optimistic assumptions about indonesia�s economic growth rate in  it projected gdp growth at  inflation contained at single digit levels in  it was around  and assumed a rupiahus dollar exchange rate of rp the rupiah closed  at an exchange rate of rp moreover no plans were announced to abolish the lucrative state licensing monopolies that had benefited his family and friends an unnamed imf sokesman informed the washington post that the indonesia government did not seem to be following through on pledges to restructure the economy and warned that the imf might hold back funds international investors and currency traders responded by selling their rupiah holdings or selling the rupiah short and the exchange rate plunged through the floor hitting rp a few days later at this point imf officials together with us deputy treasury secretary lawrence summers made a second visit to jakarta to renegotiate the imf terms of agreement on january th they reached a revised agreement which committed indonesia to a tough budget among other things this pledged budget cuts including cuts in sensitive energy subsidies trade deregulation that would wipe out many of the business privileges enjoyed by suharto�s family and friends and accelerated structural reform of the banking sector whether suharto will follow through on these commitments however remains to be seen on january th the  year old president announced his intention to run for a seventh term as president the outcome does not seem to be in doubt since the election in undertaken by hand picked delegates and suharto faces no opponent the rupiah meanwhile which was trading at around rp just before the announcement dropped sharply reaching an all time low of rp on january nd  before clawing its way bask up to rp the sharp drop reflected two concerns first fear that suharto�s apparent unwillingness to step down in the face of an economic collapse may lead to social breakdown and political violence in indonesia second growing realization that hundreds of indonesian businesses were now technically insolvent and would not be able to pay back the estimated  billion of dollar denominated debt they owed without substantial debt restructuring and rescheduling of the debt payments the imf deal for all of its good points had not addressed this critical issue south korea initially south korea seemed to be insolated from the currency turmoil sweeping through the region as the world�s th largest economy and a member of the organization of economic cooperation and development korea was clearly in a different league from thailand indonesia and malaysia however underneath the surface korea too had serious problems during much of the s foreign banks had been eager to lend us dollars to korean banks and the chaebol a significant proportion of this was short term debt that had to be paid back within a year this money was used to fund investments in industrial capacity which as suggested earlier were often undertaken at the encouragement of the government by late  it was clear that the debt financed expansion was beginning to unravel economic growth had slowed excess capacity was emerging in a number of industries prices for critical industrial products such as semiconductors were falling and imports were on the rise korea ran a current account deficit of  billion in  the korean debt problem started to deteriorate in january  when one of the chaebol hanbo collapsed under a  billion debt load a  decision to build the worlds fifth largest steel mill proved to be hanbo�s undoing costs for the project escalated from won bn to won bn while steel demand proved sluggish following hanbo�s collapse there were widespread allegations in korea that the project had been funded only because of the government pressured korean banks to lend to hanbo moreover allegations soon surfaced that government officials had been bribed by hanbo to pressure the banks the situation deteriorated further in july  when kia korea�s third largest car company ran out of cash and asked for an emergency bank loan to avoid bankruptcy at about the same time jinaro korea�s largest liquor group filed for bankruptcy these events prompted international credit agencies to start downgrading the ratings of banks with heavy exposure to the chaebol this raised the borrowing costs of the banks and led them to tighten credit making it even more difficult for debt heavy chaebol to borrow additional funds by october  it was clear that additional funds for kia would not be forthcoming from private banks so the government took the company into public ownership in order to stave off bankruptcy and job losses this followed hard on the heels of a decision by the korean government to invest an equity stake in korea first bank to stop that institution from collapsing due to a its bad loans the nationalization of kia transformed its private sector debt into public sector debt standard  poor�s the us credit rating agency immediately downgraded korea�s debt causing the korean stock market to plunge  and the currency the korean won to fall to krw according to sp the downgrade of�ratings reflects the escalating cost to the government of supporting the countrys ailing corporate and financial sectors the sp downgrade was the trigger that precipitated a sharp selloff of the korean won in an attempt to protect the won the korean central bank raised short term interest rates to over  more than double the inflation rate the bank also intervened in the currency exchange markets selling dollars and purchasing won in an attempt to keep the dollarwon exchange rate above krw the main effect of this action however was to rapidly deplete its foreign exchange reserves these stood at  billion on november st but fell to only  billion two weeks later to make matters worse the wave of bankruptcies continued among the chaebol haitai koreas th largest business filed for bankruptcy protection at the beginning of november and rumors suggests that new core another chaebol would soon follow this meant that onefifth of the country�s thirty largest businesses had now filed for bankruptcy protection moreover there was speculation that as many as half of the top  chaebol might ultimately have to file for bankruptcy international lenders fearing that korea was about to become a financial black whole refused to roll over shortterm loans to the country an action made all the more serious by revelations that korea had about  billion in short term debt obligations that had to be paid within  months with korea facing imminent financial meltdown the prospect of an imf led bailout of the country was being openly discussed on november th the korean government declared that it did not need help from the imf apparently believing that it would be able to arrange bilateral loans from the us and japan they were not forthcoming and on november th with the nation�s foreign exchange reserves almost exhausted the korean central bank gave up its defense of the won the won immediately fell below the psychologically important krw exchange rate and it kept going south on november st the now humiliated korean government was forced to reverse course and formally requested  billion in standby loans from the imf the process was complicated considerably at this point by the fact that korea was facing a presidential election campaign on december th the imf therefore had to negotiate terms with a lame duck president kim youngsam who has required to step down by the constitution while the three main candidates criticized the process from the sidelines as the negotiations progressed it soon became apparent that korea was going to need far more than  billion among other problems korea�s short term foreign debt was found to be twice as large as previously thought at close to  billion while the country�s foreign exchange reserves were down to under  billion on december rd the imf and korean government reached a deal to lend  billion to the country the imf had tried to insist that all three presidential candidates promise in writing to obey the agreement however kim daejung the centreleft opposition leader said he would refuse to sign any guarantee with the imf because it violated national pride although he did signal general compliance with the measures the agreement with the imf called for the koreans to open up their economy and banking system to foreign investors prior to the deal foreigners could only own  of a korean companys shares this was lifted to  south korea also pledged to restrain the chaebol by reducing their share of bank financing and requiring them to publish consolidated financial statements and undergo annual independent external audits on trade liberalization the imf said south korea will comply with its commitments to the world trade organization to eliminate traderelated subsidies and restrictive import licensing and streamline its import certification procedures all of which should open up the korean economy to greater foreign competition initial reaction in the stock and currency markets was very favorable with the korean stock marketing registering a  gain its biggest one day advance ever however the package started to unravel on december th when the korean government said that it would take two trouble banks into public ownership rather than closing them on the same day daewoo one of the chaebol announced that it would purchase debt laden ssangyong motor under a deal that forced ssangyong�s creditor banks to share much of the burden foreign investors saw these moves as an attempt to get around the harsh measures imposed by the imf further compounding matters were criticisms from presidential candidate kim daejung kim argued that the imf agreement represented a loss of national sovereignty and he promised that if elected he would renegotiate the deal to avoid job losses in response to these developments foreign banks refused to roll over short term loans investors sold out of the korean stock market and won and both dropped like stones the won began a precipitous fall that was to take it down to the  level in two short weeks a decline that effectively doubled the amount of won korean companies would have to earn to finance their dollar denominated debt by mid december foreign banks were only rolling over  of korean short term debt as it matured requiring that the rest be paid in full despite the imf funds foreign currency was leaving the country at the rate of  billion a day following pressure from the other presidential candidates kim daejung reversed his position and sent a letter to michael camdessus the head of the imf stating that if elected he would comply with the imf�s terms on december th kim daejung was elected president of south korea by a narrow margin he immediately turned his attention to the debt crisis his attention was heightened by the uncomfortable fact that korea was on the verge of default his first priority was to rebuild confidence and persuade foreign banks to roll over korean short term debt thereby staving off an immediate default the international community was also concerned by the possibility that a korean default would trigger a banking crisis in japan which held  billion of korean debt an event that would send economic shock waves surging around the world in the event a second agreement was reached between korea the imf and a number of major american and british banks with large exposure to korea singed on christmas eve the agreement called for the imf and eight major banks to accelerate a loan of  billion to korea to prevent a debt default for his part kim daejung spelled out in clear language that korean businesses and jobs could no longer be protected from foreign competition korea also agreed to an accelerated timetable for opening up its financial markets to foreign investors permitting foreign takeovers and allowing foreign companies to establish subsidiaries in korea the government also agreed to raise interest rates in order to attract foreign capital force the chaebol to restructure their operations sellingoff loss making units and demanding clearer accounting if the government follows through with these reforms the effect could be to transform korea�s economy from one in which the government plaid a major role in regulating and directing investment activity into one of the most marketoriented economies in asia in response for now korean stock and currency markets have stabilized but it would be naive to expect anything approaching a full recovery until the country has put its house in order the situation in south korea improved still further on january th  when a consortium of  international banks with exposure to korea agreed to reschedule their short term debt to korea according to the bank for international settlements in early  south korea was sitting on  billion in debt that was coming due for repayment in the next two years this added up to a cash flow squeeze of major proportions that the earlier imf deal had fully come to grips with under the plan south korean banks will exchange short term debt valued at  billion for new loans with maturities of one two and three years bearing interest rates of   and  percentage points higher than the six month london interbank rate by effectively rescheduling so much of its short term debt the deal gave south korea some breathing room in which it could begin to rebuild confidence in its shattered economy japan as the crisis unfolded most japanese felt that it had little to do with them at worst there was some concerns that the turmoil might harm some of the nation�s exporters indeed the main issue for debate was whether japan should take a leadership role in handling the crisis this sense of insulation was always rather myopic given that japanese banks had major exposure throughout asia for example more than half of the total foreign lending to thailand was by japanese banks the possibility always existed therefore that a collapse in many of the se asian economies could have serious repercussions for japan the confidence of the japanese was finally shaken on november the rd  when sanyo securities the nation�s seventh largest stock brokerage firm announced that it would file for bankruptcy this was followed on november th by the collapse of hokkaido takushoku japan�s th largest bank and on november nd by the announcement that yamaichi securities the fourth largest stockbroker in japan would close its doors the japanese stock market fell on the news to its lowest level in years and for a moment it looked like the asian financial crisis might spill over into japan the closure of these three institutions dated back to events almost a decade earlier in the late s when japan�s stock market and property bubble was at its peak japan�s financial institutions went on a lending binge in  the nikki stock market index briefly rose to within striking distance of  before the bubble burst and the market fell to  three years later following the collapse of stock and property prices in japan many of the loans made in the bubble years became nonperforming they were however kept on the books for years as performing loans often with the tacit support of the bank of japan in hopes that the companies involved would work their way out of financial difficulties moreover many financial institutions held a good portion of their asset in stock with the collapse in the value of the japanese stock market the value of these assets had also plummeted leaving the institutions with a diminished asset base and an increased portfolio of nonperforming loans to compound matters even further security houses such as yamaichi frequently guaranteed major customers a certain minimum rate of return on and investments they managed for the customer and would make up the difference from their own pocket if they failed to exceed that minimum in the years that followed the  collapse this meant that yamaichi and its kin had to absorb losses associated with business taken on at the height of the boom the securities houses also indulged in the questionable practice of tobashi in which brokerages temporarily shift investment losses from one client to another to prevent a favored customer from having to report losses there is only so long that a bank or security house can continue to undertake such practices without an improvement in their underlying fundamentals after eight years of recession in late  that time had arrived for sanyo securities hokkaido takushoku and yamaichi securities all three were sinking under the burden of excessive debt and nonperforming loans that all three had survived this long was a testament to the willingness of japan�s powerful ministry of finance mof to guarantee support for the country�s shaky financial institutions that all three collapsed in late  signaled a clear change of course by the ministry of finance exactly why the mof decided to change course is not completely clear some speculate that the mof wanted a shock of this sort to persuade politicians and the public to use public funds to help bail out japan�s troubled financial sector up until this point there had been widespread resistance to using public funds for this purpose another factor in the yamaichi case was that fuji bank the traditional ally of the securities firm finally withdrew its support in any event the result was to send the japanese stock market into a steep fall with investors fearing that more bankruptcies might follow the nikki index declined from  to close to  the  level is particularly significant in japan where financial institutions hold assets in the form of stock if the nikki falls below  many financial institutions will not have enough assets on their books to cover their liabilities and they will have to sell stock to reduce the ratio once this happens the japanese market could implode transforming the country�s long running recession into a full blown economic depression a depression in the world�s second largest economy would have disastrous implications for the health of the global economic system it was at this point that japanese government stepped in with the announcement that it planned to use public funds to guarantee yamaichi�s debts this was followed by a commitment to use public finds to recapitalize japan�s troubled financial institutions by january  the amount of public funds earmarked for this task had reached y billion around  billion this commitment helped to stabilize japan�s stock market and the country pulled back from the brink of financial meltdown the commitment of public funds also illustrate the difference between japan and the other asian countries afflicted by financial crises unlike the troubled tiger economies japan had amassed a huge amount of reserves that could be used shore up its trouble financial system although japan did not suffer the fate of other asian countries the problems in japan did have an impact on the situation for it considerably weakened japan�s ability to step in and take a lead roll in solving the wider asian debacle instead of japan its was left to the imf in conjunction with the united states to step in and stop the free fall in asian stock markets and currencies the credibility of japan both as a source of stability within the region and as the defacto economic leader of the asia pacific economies has been severely and perhaps permanently damaged by its inability to take a leadership role in solving the crisis aftermath implications of the crisis although the economic storm that swept through asian in  has now abated the wreckage left in its wake will undoubtedly take years to repair by indulging in a debt binge that ultimately bought its high flying economies crashing to the ground asia may have lost a decade of economic progress beyond this however the crisis has raised a series of fundamental policy questions about the sustainability of the so called asian economic model the role of the imf and the virtues of floating and fixed exchange rates the crisis also has important implications for international businesses for a decade the asian pacific region has been promoted by many as the future economic engine of the world economy businesses have invested billions of dollars in the region on the assumption that the rapid growth of the last decade would continue now it has come grinding to a halt what does this mean for international businesses with a stake in the region and for those that compete against asian companies below we discuss each of these questions in turn the asian economic model back in the late s and early s a number of authors were penning articles about the superiority of the asian economic model or asian capitalism according to its advocates the countries of the asian pacific region as exemplified by japan and south korea had put together the institutions of capitalism in a more effective way than either the united states or western european nations the so called asian model of state directed capitalism seemed to combine the dynamism of a market economy with the advantages of centralized government planning see chapter  for details it was argued that close cooperation between government and business to formulate industrial policy led to the kind of longterm planning and investment that was not possible in the west informal lending practices were credited with giving asian firms more flexibility than allowed for by the rigorous disclosure rules imposed on similar transactions in the united states and western admirers praised government policies designed to encourage exports and protect domestic producers from imports however economists have argued for some time that the asian economic miracle had nothing to do with cooperation between government and business instead it was the result of high savings rates good education systems and rapid growth in the labor force many warned that the asian proclivity for government directed investment and poorly regulated financial systems was a dangerous mix that could lead to over investment excessive debt and financial crises despite the occurrence of just such a crisis in japan in  advocates of the asian way including many leading politicians in asia steadfastly ignored the risks inherent in an interventionist economic model instead they continued to sing the praises of businessgovernment cooperation and confucian values right up to the explosion of the debt bomb and the collapse of their stock markets and currencies in late  now that the crash has occurred momentum in asia is starting to shift away from the asian way and towards the western economic model pushed in part by the imf but also by shifting opinion among some politicians and business leaders within the region asia�s troubled economies seem to be embarking on a long overdue restructuring governments are pulling back from close cooperation with businesses financial disclosure regulations are being tightened troubled banks and companies have been allowed to fail and markets are being deregulated to allow for greater competition and foreign direct investment as a consequence it seems reasonable predict that many asian economies will come to resemble more closely the free market system championed by the united states than the asian model exemplified by the japan of the s the international monetary fund the asian financial crisis has been the biggest test for the imf since the latin american debt crisis of the s and perhaps the biggest test since the institution was founded in  see chapter  for details the original charge of the imf was to lend money to member countries that were experiencing balance of payments problems and could not maintain the value of their currencies the idea was that the imf would provide short term financial loans to troubled countries giving them time to put their economies in order imf loans have always came with strings attached in the past most recipients of imf aid have suffered from excessive government spending lax monetary policy and high inflation consequently conditions attached to imf loans have normally required the borrowing country to slash government spending and raise interest rates to slow monetary growth and inflation as a result of the asian crisis in late  the imf found itself committing over  billion in short term loans to three countries south korea indonesia and thailand to put this in perspective the largest loan prior to this was the  billion package that the imf gave to mexico in  following the collapse of the mexican peso as with other aid packages the imf loans come with conditions attached the imf is insisting on a combination of tight macroeconomic policies including cuts in public spending and higher interest rates the deregulation of sectors formally protected from domestic and foreign competition and better financial reporting from the banking sector although politicians in each country initially resisted these conditions they ultimately accepted them and so far at least seem to be pursuing them despite the acquiescence of local politicians the imf policies towards asian countries have come in for unusually tough criticisms from many western observers one criticism is that tight macroeconomic policies are inappropriate for countries that are suffering not from excessive government spending and inflation but from a private sector debt crisis with deflationary undertones in korea for example the government has been running a budget surplus for years it was  of korea�s gdp in the  period and inflation is low at around  indeed korea has the second strongest financial position of any country in the organization for economic cooperation and development despite this say critics the imf is insisting on applying the same policies that it applies to countries suffering from high inflation the imf is requiring korea to maintain an inflation rate of  however given the collapse in the value of its currency and the subsequent rise in price for imports such as oil inflationary pressures will inevitably increase in korea so to hit a  inflation rate the koreans are being forced to apply an unnecessarily tight monetary policy short term interest rates in korea jumped from  to  immediately after korea signed its initial deal with the imf the essential problem here is that increasing interest rates make it even more difficult for korean companies to service their already excessive short term debt obligations that is the cure prescribed by the imf may actually increase the probability of widespread corporate defaults in korea not reduce them for its part the imf rejects this criticism according to the imf the critical task is to rebuild confidence in the korean currency the won once this has been achieved the won will recover from its extremely oversold levels this will reduce the size of korea�s dollar denominate debt burden when expressed in won in turn making it easier for korean companies to service their dollar denominated debt the imf also argues that by requiring korea to remove restrictions on foreign direct investment foreign capital will flow into korea to take advantage of cheap assets this too will increase demand for the korean currency and help to improve the dollarwon exchange rate a second criticism of the imf is that its rescue efforts are exacerbating a problem know to economists as moral hazard moral hazard arises when people behave recklessly because they know they will be saved if things go wrong in the case of asia critics point out that many japanese and western banks were far too willing to lend large amounts of capital to overleveraged asian companies during the boom years of the s these critics argue that the banks should now be forced to pay the price for their rash lending policies even if that means some banks must shut down only by taking such drastic action so the argument goes will banks learn the error of their ways and not engage in rash lending in the future by providing support to these countries the imf is reducing the probability of debt default and in effect bailing out the very banks whose loans gave rise to this situation in the first place the problem with this argument is that it ignores two critical points first if some japanese or western banks with heavy exposure to the troubled asian economies were forced to write off their loans due to widespread debt default this would have an impact that would be difficult to contain the failure of large japanese banks for example could trigger a meltdown in the japanese financial markets in turn this would almost inevitably lead to a serious decline in stock markets around the world that is the very risk that the imf was trying to avoid in the first place by stepping in with financial support second it is incorrect to imply that some banks have not had to pay the price for rash lending policies in fact the imf has insisted on the closure of banks in korea thailand and indonesia moreover foreign banks with short termloans outstanding to korean enterprises have been essentially forced by circumstances to reschedule those loans at interest rates that do not compensate for the extension of the loan maturity the final criticism of the imf is that is has become too powerful for an institution that lacks any real mechanism for accountability by the end of  the imf was engaged in loan programs in  developing countries that collectively contain  billion people the imf was determining macroeconomic policies in those countries yet according to critics such as noted harvard economist jeffery sachs with a staff of under  the imf lacks the indepth expertise required to do a good job evidence of this according to sachs can be found in the fact that the imf was singing the praises of the thai and south korean governments only months before both countries lurched into crisis then the imf put together a draconian program for korea without having deep knowledge of the country sachs solution to this problem is to reform the imf so that it makes greater use of outside experts and so that its operations are open to great outside review and scrutiny implications for exchange rate policy as outlined in chapter  of this book there is a long running debate in international business and economics between those who favor fixed exchange rate mechanisms and those who favor a floating system since the collapse of the bretton woods� fixed exchange rate system in  the world has functioned with a floating exchange rate system see chapter  however there are variations to this theme most asian countries tried to peg the value of their currency against the us dollar intervening selectively in the foreign exchange markets to support the value of their currency this practice know as a managed float is an attempt to achieve some of the benefits associated with a fixed exchange rate regime in a world of that lacks such a regime critics argue that such a policy is vulnerable to speculative pressure the events that unfolded in the fall of  have given the critics additional ammunition the value of the korean indonesia thai and malaysian currencies did not just decline against the dollar they collapsed in spectacular fashion illustrating the sometimes extreme results of speculative attacks on a currency in a world of floating exchange rates the experience of hong kong during the crisis however has added a new dimension to the debate hong kong was able to maintain the value of its currency against the us dollar at around hk despite several concerted speculative attacks how did it manage to do this one answer that has been offered is that hong kong operates with a currency board a country that introduces a currency board commits itself to converting its domestic currency on demand into another currency at a fixed exchange rate to make this commitment credible the currency board holds reserves of foreign currency equal at the fixed exchange rate to at least  of the domestic currency issued so for example the system used in hong kong means that its currency must be fully backed by the us dollar at the specified exchange rate of course this is not a true fixed exchange rate regime since the us dollar and by extension the hong kong dollar floats against other currencies but it does has some of the features of a fixed exchange rate regime under this arrangement the currency board can only issue additional domestic notes and coins when there are foreign exchange reserves to back it this limits the ability of the government to print money and thereby create inflationary pressures under a strict currency board system interest rates adjust automatically if investors want to switch out of domestic currency into for example us dollars the supply of domestic currency will shrink this will cause interest rates to rise until it eventually becomes attractive for investors to hold the local currency again in the case of hong kong the interest rate on  month depots climbed as high as  in late  as investors switched out of hong kong dollars and into us dollars the dollar peg however held and interest rates declined again since its establishment in  the hong kong currency board has weathered several storms including the latest this success seems to be persuading other countries in the developing world to consider a similar system argentina introduced a currency board in  and bulgaria estonia and lithuania have all gone down this road in recent years despite growing interest in the arrangement however critics are quick to point out that currency boards have their drawbacks if local inflation rates remain higher than the inflation rate in the country to which the currency is pegged the currencies of countries with currency boards can become uncompetitive and overvalued moreover under a currency board system government lacks the ability to set interest rates interest rates in hong kong for example are effectively set by the american federal reserve despite these drawbacks however hong kong�s success in avoiding the currency collapse that afflicted its asian neighbors suggests that other developing countries may adopt a similar system in the future implications for business the asian financial crisis throws the risks associated with doing business in developing countries into sharp focus for most of the s multinational companies have viewed asia as a future economic powerhouse and invested accordingly this view was not without foundation the region is home to  of the world�s people and a number of dynamic economies that have been growing by nearly  per year for most of the past decade this euphoric view was rudely shattered by the events of late  it would be wrong to conclude however that the impact upon companies doing business in the region will be purely negative on closer examination there is a silver lining to many of the storm clouds hanging over asia on the negative side on the equation the asian crisis will undoubtedly have some painful effects on companies with major activities and investments in the region�s troubled economies for example when the malaysian government cancelled its  billion bakun hydroelectric damn project this hurt abb the large european based engineering firm that was a prime contractor on the project abb took a  million charge and the asian slowdown helped to trigger job cuts totaling  in many of its european facilities similarly boeing expressed concern that the asian crisis may result in as many as  orders for large jet aircraft being postponed or cancelled to make matters worse many asian companies will now be looking to export their way out of recessionary conditions in their home markets this may lead to a flood of low priced exports from troubled asia economies to other countries united states and european steel companies for example are bracing themselves to deal with the adverse impact on demand and prices in their home market of an increased in the supply of low cost steel from south korea the fall in the value of the korean won against the dollar has given korean steel companies a competitive edge in global markets that they lacked just six months ago on the other hand firms that source components from asia have seen a steep drop in the price of those inputs which has a beneficial impact on profit margins for example dell computer the large us based manufacturer of personal computers has seen a  drop in the price of certain components such as memory chips that it buys from asian manufacturers similarly even though abb took a hit when it lost the bakun dam project the company argues that this will be more than offset over the next few years by increases in exports from its own factories based in that region furthermore several firms are reportedly taking advantage of the changing circumstances in asia to increase their rate of investment in the region plunging stock markets across the region have left many asian companies trading at prices that are less than their breakup value while the imf�s rescue packages have required korea indonesia and thailand to relax restrictions on inward foreign direct investment as a result of these factors it is reasonable to expect firms from outside of these countries to start buying the assets of troubled companies while they can be purchased for cents on the dollar indeed there are signs that that is starting to happen in december  for example citicorp was reported to be examining the books of thailand�s seventh largest bank first bangkok city bank with a view to making an acquisition citicorp was also reported to be looking for acquisitions in south korea finally it is worth emphasizing that despite its dramatic impact the long run effects of the crisis may be good not bad to the extent that the crisis gives asian countries an incentive to reform their economic systems and to initiate some much need restructuring they may emerge from the experience not weaker but stronger institutions and a greater ability to attain sustainable economic growth   asian financial corp private company information  bloomberg july    am et banks company overview of asian financial corp snapshot people company

locatedgenerally speaking most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business andor a physical presence in that state if you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign out of state company with your home state which will subject you to all of the fees

employees of the corporation note the c in c corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code c corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations c corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to passthrough to the personal income tax statements of the owners as such c corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities c corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business if desired and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income c corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends but this can also lead to double taxation what is stock par value par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares it doesnt necessarily reflect their real value and is typically set at a low value ie one dollar or one cent the par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class the shares can be sold to the initial shareholders at par value or more but the price must be the same for each share not all states require a par value unless you specify otherwise incfile will authorize  shares this is due to the fact that  is easily divisible by      with a par value of one cent or at no par value if not required by your state what are bylaws the

independent attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
