anousheh’s space blog мой блог на русском deutsche tagebuch ترجمه فارسی بلاگ anousheh thoughts frequently asked questions there have been many questions about anousheh her life her success and her space adventures below are several of the commonly asked questions along with pictures for your enjoyment when did you become interested in space anousheh as a young child in iran since i was a young girl in iran space has always fascinated me  i would lie on my balcony at night and just look up at the stars i was fascinated by the sheer mystery of space what’s out there what’s it like and how i could get there when i was young i made the decision i wanted to be an astronautastrophysicist and travel into space you arrived in the united states at the age of  not speaking a word of english how challenging was it for you to progress to where you are today anousheh as a teenager education has always been emphasized in my family so when i came to the united states as a teenager i was already in the mindset that i must work hard to learn english as well as my chosen field of study there is so much opportunity in the united states and i have worked hard to take advantage of those opportunities to achieve my dreams it’s been challenging but following your dreams is always a challenge i wouldn’t want to live any other way what afforded you the opportunity to take this trip my husband and i started our own company telecom technologies inc using all our money out of our savings in  and we worked very hard for many years  this company eventually developed a softswitch which enabled voice communications over the internet in  we merged with sonus networks inc nasdaq sons a provider of ipbased voice infrastructure products in a deal worth approximately  million how did you get into the telecommunications business i first developed an interest in telecommunications while in college i earned a bachelor’s degree in electronics and computer engineering from george mason university in  followed by a master’s degree in electrical engineering from george washington university in   my husband and i both launched our careers at mci where we gained incredible handson experience in the telecommunications industry then we saw a great opportunity to launch our own telecommunications venture  why was telecom technologies inc so successful anousheh in the sept  issue of forbes magazine telecom technologies inc had fast success in part because of a groundbreaking business strategy rather than pursuing noholdsbarred competition with closed proprietary technologies we followed a strategy of cooperation and open standards our company actually worked with – instead of against – its competitors’ products we invited all telecom product manufacturers to participate in an interoperability lab that our company launched and funded despite the extra cost this lab was a breakthrough for the entire telecommunications industry it encouraged the development of products and services that could work together in voice networks instead of being incompatible why did you sell your company while it was still an expanding and lucrative company in our hearts my family and i are entrepreneurs we embrace the challenges of developing and launching technologies that will literally change industries by  telecom technologies owned three key us patents and had  employees the time was right for a merger with sonus networks inc which offered the opportunity to grow the capabilities of the technology what convinced you to undertake such an unusual adventure to space as i’ve mentioned before i’ve had a passion for space since i was very young i never lost that passion even as i grew older and continued on into my business life  once dennis tito started talking about buying a trip to space on the russian soyuz space craft in the s i decided to work really hard at my business and if all else failed i could buy a ticket what prompted you to set up the ansari x prize and was it worth paying such a large prize hamid ansari erik lindbergh anousheh ansari peter diamandis and amir ansari at x prize   x prize spaceship one celebration my family worked with the x prize foundation to provide title sponsorship for the ansari x prize together we awarded  million for the first nongovernmental organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into space twice within two weeks in  aerospace designer burt rutan won the prize space is a very important part of the future of human race and space travel is something everyone should eventually have access to my family is working toward helping the industry and making space travel more affordable and accessible to more people the ansari x prize was an important step in that process and it was well worth the investment you were not originally planned to travel on this expedition weren’t you just training as a backup dice k and anousheh training in a zero gravity plane in february  i was asked to serve as the backup for daisuke enomoto dicek a private space explorer from japan who had been slated for the trip in september i agreed and shortly after that i started my sixmonth training course in star city russia as well as crosstraining at johnson space center in houston  in august  just a few weeks before the scheduled flight dicek was medically disqualified i then became a primary crew of the soyuz tma as a replacement did you perform the same training as the dicek dice k anousheh and hamid weightless in a zero gravity flight yes dicek and i had the exact same training during the six months prior to the trip did you have to undergo full astronaut training for your trip zero g training learning to dress in zero gravity forest survival training         water survival training classroom training   i started a sixmonth preparation for the trip in february  at star city in russia this included classroom training simulator training zerog and survival techniques – the same training received by astronauts but while my training was at ‘user’ level they undergo around two years’ more indepth training to a ‘repair systems’ level however i had to take an active role as crew member what was your least favorite training experience   video  of anousheh in the spinning chair   anousheh in the spinning chair the spinning chair was my least favourite training experience did you ever think about quitting anousheh’s personalized space gloves never why don’t you call your self a space “tourist” as i described above i was part of a sixmonth training program along side the other crew members and i took an active role as a crew member i think the term ‘space tourist’ undermines what you have to do on the mission can you describe your feelings as you boarded the spacecraft and prepared for lift off september   tma soyuz launch the day of the flight i thought i would be really nervous so i was surprised to see that i wasn’t we spent two and a half hours in the capsule preparing launch procedures after that they put some music on and we had a chance to relax – it was actually very ‘zenlike’ waiting for the moment when my dream would come true i had watched the international space station iss expedition  launch during my training so i was prepared for a lot of noise and explosions but as the soyuz lifted off at g from inside the capsule the launch felt surprisingly smooth my american fellow crew member who had also flown the shuttle remarked that the soyuz was very smooth in comparison who were your crew members september   tma soyuz launch i was part of expedition  which included a total of three crew members commander michael lopezalegria flight engineer mikhail tyurin and myself our mission was to relieve expedition  commander pavel vingradov and nasa science officer jeff williams after their sixmonth mission on the iss how long were you up in space it took two days to travel to the international space station then i spent eight days on the iss before returning to earth with vinogradov and williams the members of the iss expedition  crew who had spent the previous six months on board the iss  the trip back to earth took about four hours why did it take you two days to reach the iss tma soyuz docking to the iss it doesn’t take very long to get out of the earth’s atmosphere however our journey required circling the earth to get to the appropriate orbit for docking to the international space station what is the international space station the iss and a view of earth   animated view of the iss the international space station iss is a collaboration of  countries who have come together cooperatively and peacefully to work in space  the iss rotates  miles above the earth and has about  cubic feet of space which is the same square footage as a three bedroom house  the iss ways about   pounds which is approximately the weight of  elephants  it moves at the speed of  miles per hour and makes a full rotation around the earth once every  minutes  so each day i was able to see  sunsets and  sunrises what was the most awesome thing about being in space anousheh weightless in the iss the feeling of weightlessness was the most incredible thing about the trip nothing compares to the absolute freedom i felt when i could literally fly across the room and propel myself with the gentle push of a single finger did you at any point pinch yourself and say i cant believe im here anousheh experiencing the fun of weightlessness yes  every morning when i woke up i had to remind myself that i was not dreaming is this the craziest thing you ever did yes  i’m not a thrill seeker  ridding rockets is not what interests me  the destination is what i love and the only way to get here now is through the soyuz how did you prepare yourself for this journey besides the intensive training i have been mentally preparing for it all my life imagining this moment and my entire trip how was your iss and soyuz experience from the perspective of habitability graphical picture of the soyuz photo of soyuz modules     photo of soyuz inside the iss habitability comprises human factor issues including but not limited to food sleep hygiene noise temperature odours movement orientation safety ergonomics provision for exercise recreation habitat configuration the soyuz is comprised of two habitable areas the descent module and the habitation module  both are fairly small the descend module is where the three crew stay during launch and landing  each crew member has a seat liner that has been moulded to their body  the space is cramped and you have to sit in a fetal position  the habitation module is where you eat sleep and go to toilet  it is also fairly small  with all the cargo you have enough room for three people to stand next to each other  the iss is a much roomier place considering you are living  mile above earth it is fairly nice and has all the necessities for leaving comfortably  although the noise level is high and the space is not designed optimally  there is enough variety of exercise equipment available to give everyone a chance to exercise do you have any suggestions for design improvements that can enhance the habitability of future space habitats  i think adding a shower would be nice  auto electronic wireless inventory scanners and management system would save a lot of time for the astronauts  another consideration could be to have a low noise area that would serve as sleeping quarters for all crew members how would you rate the experience a beautiful view of our earth the whole experience was absolutely great from the preparation in star city where i could immerse myself in the space world meeting and getting to know cosmonauts and astronauts and hearing their stories and experiences to the trip itself that was out of this world being in space was absolutely amazing especially experiencing weightlessness seeing the earth from the space station changed my perception of the planet and made me feel much more protective of this precious gift that we have to look after i didn’t want to go back and even considered hiding on board the iss although i did miss my husband and family very much by then how would you compare the experience of actually going into space with what you thought it might be like preliftoff did it meet or exceed your expectations after years of anticipation and six months of intensive training my expectations were extremely high even so my trip into space exceeded those expectations it was the most thrilling experience of my life what was the general reaction of your family when they found out about your plans of traveling to space and when was that exactly anousheh and her  husband hamid i told my family soon after i was notified on august   they were all very excited and told me that they will be praying for my safe return they’ve always known this was my lifelong dream i’ve always said that even if it was a oneway ticket i would have taken it was it difficult being away from your family during your training and flight anousheh with her family the day of the launch i spent more than six months in intensive training to prepare for my journey to space during that time i stayed almost full time in star city moscow  i was able to talk to my husband and the rest of my family on the phone  being away from them especially my husband was one of the most difficult parts of this journey but it was the only way i could realize my dream was this experience worth the financial investment you made to take the trip it is hard to put a price on your dream  i was ready to risk my life for this dream  the experience and the satisfaction you get from knowing that you have been able to realize your childhood dream through a lot of hard work perseverance  and sacrifice made it all worth it as well as the months spent in preparation were well worth it  seeing the earth from the space station changed my perception of the planet and made me feel much more protective of this precious gift that we have to look after how did you purchase this trip i purchased this trip with the russian space agency through a company called space adventures  space adventures has purchased several seats on russia soyuz expeditions why do you think space is so important to society and young people today there are many reasons that we need space exploration  we can investigate many problems on earth in microgravity that will help us to ensure the longevity of the human race and every science can be applied to space from biology to new research in engines materials and fuels do you think your trip has increased people’s interest in space especially among women i think my trip put a more public face on space especially for women  people look at me and see that i’m a regular person that allows them to understand that flying to space is also possible for them   we live in an exciting time where the doors to the “final frontiers” have been kicked open to the public  there are many new developments in the space industry right now  just two years ago the successful flight of the ansari x prize vehicle provided the first glimpse into commercial space possibilities  recently nasa announced that it would pursue development of a moon base which could have potential commercial applications in future  the possibilities are endless for people who are interested in space and you don’t have to just be a pilot or rocket scientist to pursue your interest in space what advice would you give to a young person considering science engineering or space there is so much going on in the space industry right now government agencies are still doing a lot of work while private space exploration is really growing companies like space adventures and virgin galactic are helping to find new ways so that even more private citizens can experience space and there will be many exciting projects to work on   in your professional life did you or do you ever feel you had to prove yourself because you’re a woman all the time but i did not let this make me bitter  it was just an extra step and i took it to get to my destination being a successful female entrepreneur do you see it as a challenge to balance work and family life creating balance is a challenge for every business person especially women i think perhaps the best way to accomplish this balance is to focus on your goals that way you can ensure that your time is being focused in a way that furthers those goals and objectives both in your personal and professional life why is space important to you i feel space is a very important part of the future of human race and space travel is something everyone should eventually have access to  my family and i are working to raise interest in private investment into space travel which i believe is critical to the future of the human race we also hope to help make space travel more affordable and accessible to more people you’re going to be in world history  how do you feel about that fortunately by going into space i have gained a media platform to deliver my message to more and more people around the world first i’m working to inspire all people – especially women and girls – to chase their own dreams no matter how lofty their goals may seem i feel that as long as my trip brings a positive inspiration for our youth it is a good event to be recorded in history  how do you think your iranian background has shaped the person you are today i’m a us citizen who was born in iran both countries are part of who i am my roots are in iran and america has given me the opportunities that i would have never had in iran and made it possible for me to realize my dream in particular my iranian heritage instilled a focus on education and a strong work ethic into my everyday life both countries are part of who i am    while on the international space station i was thrilled to see people from all over the middle east post messages on my blog saying how excited they were to see the first iranian astronaut blast into space it showed how people of all backgrounds share a common bond – the longing to accomplish their dreams are you a political person i am non political person and do not like controversy youve set several firstsnew benchmarks in the world  was this an exercise in showmanship or a genuine desire to fulfil a lifelong hobby ever since i was young i have had a passion for space and space exploration i was fascinated by the sheer mystery of space what’s out there what’s it like and how i could get there the fact that i set different benchmarks means very little in my journey the good thing about this is that it has provided me the media platform to deliver my message to more and more people around the world would you recommend it to those with a strong interest in travelflightexploration to endeavour to follow in your footsteps i would definitely recommend this to whoever has a passion for space for flight for natural beauty for exploration and for having an out of this world experience  i hope that someday everyone has the opportunity to go into space this is certainly a life altering experience  this experience opens your mind to a bigger perspective on our home planet the universe and the role we play in this equation do you think being a woman matters in space i don’t think it should make any difference  it should just be proof that both women and men can equally enjoy a trip to space do you consider yourself an example for all women i hope to be  i want to inspire all children especially girls and women around the world to dream big and to go after their dream what are you doing now that you are back from space i am very busy with many projects but my main focus is our technology company prodea systems which was launched the same day i launched into space september    i’m also writing my memoirs with homer hickam the  best selling author of rocket boys which was produced into the movie october sky i am a member of the board of trustees of the x prize foundation as well as a member of the x prize foundation’s vision circle  i’m working on an educational program to help inspire our youth’s interest in learning and going into math and science especially girls and to renew their interest and understanding of space  i also work with two philanthropic organizations ashoka and parsa can you tell us more about prodea systems my family and i are running our new technology company called prodea systems inc  this has been another dream of ours for some time  this company will dramatically alter a consumer’s digital living experience and unleash the power of the internet to all consumers technical and nontechnical we haven’t launched our product to the market at this time but you can read more about our company on our web site wwwprodeasystemscom can you tell us more about your book and homer hickam and how you chose him to help with your book anousheh with homer hickam homer actually contacted one of my employees when he found out i was going to space  he said that he read my blog while i was in space  we met in alabama in december  after i returned from space  homer and i share the same passion and interest in space which was what i hoped to find in a coauthor plus we get along great you can find out more details about homer at wwwhomerhickamcom what is ashoka ashoka is a nonprofit organization that supports social entrepreneurship around the world including the middle east and central asia you can read more about this organization at wwwashokaorg what is parsa parsa community foundation is a nonprofit organization that promotes strategic philanthropy and social entrepreneurship among the global iranian community  you can read more about this organization at wwwparsacforg do you have your own song well yes actually “be the change” is a composition by deep dish who is grammy winning duo of sharam tayebi and ali “dubfire” shirazinia  i was very flattered when i found out they dedicated this song to me you can find out more details about deep dish at on their site  wwwdeepdishcom any other dreams or adventures that you hope to accomplish in the near future my dream is to see space travel become like a normal option for family vacations in the future do you have a message for other people that want to be in your shoes my message to them is not to give up and to be part of a positive force to bring space travel to the general public  the more interest sparked in this area and the more innovation is generated the more affordable this trip will become and they will be one step closer to realize their dream copyright   anousheh ansari  all

companies she currently works to enable social entrepreneurs to bring about radical change globally with organizations such as x prize ashoka and the parsa community foundation lucy sanders hi this is lucy sanders im the ceo of the national center for women and information technology or ncwit and this is one of a series of interviews we are doing with women who have started it companies weve heard some wonderful stories from some very fabulous women and we have another great interview in this series today with me is larry nelson from wwcom larry why dont you tell us a little bit about ww larry nelson my wife pat and i started the internet radio show wwcom in  we archive everything from photos to articles and all of the interviews and this ncwit hero series i tell you is one of the most exciting projects ‑‑ period ‑‑ that weve ever worked on and its getting a great deal of response from both business and government as well as education lucy well and were really happy to have you here today and were also very grateful that you are syndicating this series on your site as well also with us is lee kennedy ncwit board director and serial entrepreneur herself having just started a new company called tricalyx  helping all of us use the web better for our businesses so welcome lee lee kennedy thanks lucy these are really fun to participate in lucy well today we have a great interview with anousheh ansari the chairman and cofounder of prodea systems i took a look at the website of prodea systems and its just got the coolest mission its a new company its focused on the home on the digital environment within the home everything from voice services and networking services in the home to parental control and maybe child control that would be all right too and home automation anousheh has the coolest title larry and lee i have to tell you because not only is she chairman and cofounder of prodea systems but she also has the title of first private female space explorer larry all right lucy so anousheh we are really happy to have you here welcome anousheh thank you im happy to be on the show lucy with that well just get right to the interview we have a lot of questions to ask you about entrepreneurship and technology lee so anuosheh one of my favorite questions is to hear how you first got into technology was it something through your childhood or there was a moment in time that it all started being so interesting and then wed also love to know what do you think are cool today as far as the technologies that are out anousheh i always loved science and math growing up i was born in iran i grew up there and then came to the united states when i was about  years old and i thought that this was my opportunity to get involved with something really cool and great and thats why when i graduated from high school at that time the field of telecommunication and electrical engineering was the hottest field and it was growing and a lot of technology was being developed back then and thats why i chose electrical engineering as my career and ended up getting a bachelor degree and a masters degree in electrical engineering  and basically built a career in telecommunication dealing with planning and developing the future networks that would allow communication technologies to be enhanced this is what we see today and i think thats one of the coolest things today with the internet the use of internet by the entire population ‑ as part of education and just on a daily basis for communication i think that has been one of the coolest technologies that has been developed and it has in the past decade lucy anousheh you cofounded telecom technologies in the early s when you were doing some of the early work on voice over ip and soft switches anousheh exactly yes lucy that was a pretty exciting time we were working on that in bell labs and so we followed your company so it was a great effort and very entrepreneurial anousheh yes one of the things that really gets me excited and makes me start up companies is the fact that you can basically build something new try to introduce a change in a way that people are used to doing certain activities and basically create something out of scratch that doesnt exist and would revolutionize whatever it is that you are trying to do with it so thats part of the reason i love being able to be a technologist and being in this field and also being able to start up companies that introduce these types of new gadgets into the market larry thats a great segue into a question ive got here you are anousheh youre the first female private space explorer all kinds of opportunities a wonderful background and theres always the risk as well as the adrenaline rush about being an entrepreneur what is it you were just beginning to talk about some of the reasons why you are an entrepreneur and what about being an entrepreneur makes you tick anousheh well being an entrepreneur means that you are sort of inventing something new youre giving birth to a company youre giving birth to a new product a new service and thats always exciting and to me i dont like to just have a repetitive life where i do the same thing over and over i love to be able to learn something new explore something new im an explorer by nature and being an entrepreneur allows me to explore new opportunities and technologies and thats the best part of it but also being an entrepreneur i love to help people and i think through the products that we develop in my company we will be able to help a lot of people whether its help them to get over the difficulties of a technology and use it this is what we do with my new company at prodea or helping employees creating new jobs new opportunities for people that work in my company so all along whether its creating something or just building a company and giving others the opportunity to build a career i think its exciting to be at the helm of these types of activities and thats what makes being an entrepreneur really exciting for me lucy well and your new company is in a great niche i have to say were shopping for a new washer and dryer now and we can actually put it on the network in our house larry oh wow lucy im not sure what im going to say to the washer and dryer but anousheh maybe you can help me out with that anousheh the technology were developing is geared toward taking advantage of all these new smart devices that are being built for the home but one thing we realized was that we wanted everyone to be able to take advantage of this new technology and use it but it is sometimes complicated a lot of things are based on pc and some of our parents for example are not really excited about using pcs and its a drag for them so it doesnt have to be that way technology doesnt have to be difficult to use or complicated we feel technology is something thats there to make your life easier not more difficult so what weve done is weve decided to make all these technologies very simple and easy to use and as much as possible let you use your tv and your remote control to interface with everything smart in your house and manage everything versus having to deal with a computer lucy well it really does sound like a great company and like i said it really does fill a great niche for people especially some of the things like data backup and other things that people put a lot of time and effort into their computers and then they lose it all for example if it crashes so its a great value proposition in this series we are very interested in asking people about their role models or people who really encouraged them on this path toward entrepreneurship can you tell us a bit about who influenced you anousheh i have to say the biggest influence in my life has been by husband who is also my partner in the business we started our companies together and hes always been there encouraging me to take on new challenges in my life and when i do take them on hes right beside me supporting and helping me through all the difficult time so having a really good partner whether its a good friend someone in your family or a spouse is always the greatest thing to have when you have a new challenge that youre facing lucy thats great theres not many of us that have a partner thats right along in our career anousheh thats true ive been very fortunate because sometimes its difficult to work with your spouse but in our case its a great working relationship and we have complementary skills which makes it easy to work together so ive been very fortunate in that regard lucy so on the flip side of that when you think about your career whats been the toughest thing youve had to do anousheh being an entrepreneur and starting new companies require a lot of sacrifice sacrifice that you have to make because in order to be really successful your company becomes your life and then you have to really dedicate your time and energy fully to this endeavor that you start and doing anything less than that means that youre doing yourself and your employees a disservice so it does require a lot of sacrifice of your personal time and personal hobbies and things that you enjoy at least for the period of high growth that you experience at the beginning of a companys life cycle you have to be ready to make a lot of time sacrifices and personal sacrifice lucy i think that that is really good advice that you would give to a young person who is considering entrepreneuship that you be prepared for those type of time sacrifices and be prepared for the amount of dedication it takes to be an entrepreneur if you were sitting with a room of young people and giving them any further advice about entrepreneurship what else would you tell them anousheh maybe just continue on i dont want to make it sound like its really bad or difficult to be an entrepreneur it does require commitment it is hard work but it is also highly rewarding so when you can look back and see yourself building a successful company when you see your employees happy and excited about the success of the company when you introduce something new a product in the world that gets really high marks and everyone loves using it and raves about it it is very rewarding and you will feel very good about it so my advice to everyone is find something that you love to do and you are passionate about ‑ you enjoy because if youre not passionate about something its very difficult to be dedicated to it so find something you enjoy and love and youre passionate about and then dedicate all youve got to make it a success and if you have those two things i think with your passion and dedication there is nothing that you cannot accomplish lucy so when you think about yourself and your personal characteristics what do you think has given you the advantage to be an entrepreneur anousheh i think one thing that has helped me maybe is being an immigrant and coming to the united states i had to basically build a new life for myself and adjust very quickly to a new environment new culture learn a new language so i think a lot of the fears and risk averseness that people may have develop living in a comfortable lifestyle and having everything be provided to them as they grow up that sort of went away from me and made me sort of a person that would be willing to take risks and face the challenges and not be afraid of failure because being an immigrant and staring life over you learn to be a survivor and how to face your challenges and basically overcome them and that has been a great skill set that ive developed and has helped me in my career larry i have a lot of empathy ‑‑ pat and i both do ‑‑ for you moving into a new country i understand you did not know english before you moved here is that true anousheh yes thats true larry and weve owned businesses and lived in five different countries and other than australia the other countries didnt speak english so i really had quite a learning lesson to go through pat and i weve owned our own business together for ‑plus years so i just want to let you know theres hope down the road larry so with that this is my litte segue into how do you balance your busy busy professional life along with your personal life and your family and everything else anousheh its difficult to balance it but you find little things that basically take the stress away and help you refocus and get energy you need to face your new challenges on a daily basis of course spending time with family is always good i love the outdoors so if i get a chance to go out and hike or bike around thats always great if i dont have time to leave just listening to some music that i love reenergizes me and gives me that break i need to go back to whatever it is im doing you have to find things that are accessible and doable in your busy life and try to fit some time in your schedule to just have time to yourself and be able to recoup and refocus larry its amazing some of the things that you pointed out remind me of lucys favorite way of calling it ‑‑ not balance but integrating anousheh absolutely you have to find ways of integrating what you like into your business life and its difficult at times but i think over time with experience you learn how to do it lucy i want to maybe inject a ninth question even though we promised wed only have eight i think our listeners would probably love to hear a few comments from you about your insights from your space travel especially since its very relevant to the topic of adventure and entrepreneurship and technology anousheh just to give you a little bit of background even though my career was in telecommunications one of my greatest passions since i was a little girl was to fly to space and when i came to the united states there were difficulties that i was facing because i was an immigrant didnt have citizenship so i couldnt become an astronaut but i never gave up on that dream and i told myself and i believed that one day i would be able to fulfill that dream and my career in electrical engineering and being an entrepreneur is what ultimately helped me realize that dream and it was a wonderful thing to be able to realize it while i had just celebrated my th birthday it was a great sense of accomplishment and an experience that has changed my life and will be with me forever its given me a new perspective on life and it helps me every day for me one of the things i do ‑‑ when you were talking about balancing your personal life and doing things you love ‑‑ when im very stressed out and i cant get out and i need to do something i just close my eyes and try to remember what it was like to be in space and to float around and that sort of brings back all of those good sensations and good memories and it helps me to get through the day lucy well i know for one ill be watching you probably in your next company doing something with space anousheh i hope so too because its one of those things that when you do it once its sort of like an addiction you want to be able to fly again and i hope that ill get a chance to fly again to space someday and ill let you know maybe the next company lucy maybe then they could take a  year old woman with her anousheh theres no age limit as long as youre young at heart you can fly to space lucy that would be so cool well anousheh youve really achieved a lot in your career whats next for you we know space travel is next anything else anousheh theres a lot of things happening in my life of course our company is in the very early stages and growing very rapidly so that takes up a lot of my time but i have also a personal passion for space and making sure that the space industry ‑ or the private side of the space industry ‑ grows and provides opportunity for people like myself who love to fly to space to do it thats why im involved with the x prize foundation and creating opportunities to expand the whole private sector in the space industry also global education is something that is important for me because i believe that our future is going to be built by our young generation and being able to give them the best opportunity to gain all the knowledge they need and to be able to use their imagination and be able to maintain that imaginative mind they have when theyre four or five years old and carry that imagination throughout their life and be able to use the knowledge they gain from their environment and create something better ‑ something new and a world thats really peaceful and safe thats something that i dream of and im trying to do my part in making sure that environment is available to our young generation larry anousheh i would like to just personally thank you and im sure this is from all of us the inspiration that came along with not only you being the first female private space explorer but the idea of what you had to all go through behind it from not understanding english and working in a new country and really exploring your passions between math and it and its just been a great story that we will continue to carry that flag for youre super anousheh thank you it was a pleasure to talk to you guys today larry by the way you listeners out there first of all this will be on the ncwitorg website thats wwwncwitorg and of course well also have it on our blog and our podcast at wwcom where you can download it  and lee and lucy and larry ‑ the three ls ‑ we want to thank you so much anousheh for joining us today anousheh
