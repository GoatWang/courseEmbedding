therapeutics inc ceo issues letter to shareholders highlighting significant progress jan    et from immune therapeutics inc orlando fla jan   prnewswire  immune therapeutics inc otcbb imun a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted immune  therapies announced today that its chief executive officer noreen griffin issued a letter to shareholders highlighting the significant progress the company has made toward its vision of becoming a leading developer of immune therapies  as we come to the end of  i want to provide an overview of the accomplishments and the significant strides that immune therapeutics inc is making toward our vision of becoming a leading developer of targeted immunotherapies like you i have been disappointed as our stock price has continued to decline  we are getting calls from shareholders and it is clear that there is a lot of concern and confusion as some shareholders are only watching the stock price and consider no other information it is easy to listen to rumors or to assume the worst  as you read the following overview you can see why we believe that our stock does not at all reflect the underlying value of the company among other things i will discuss the significant potential of our lead product candidate lodonal in emerging nations which we believe is one of the primary value drivers for immune therapeutics  in addition i will discuss the current status of the clinical trial process for cytocom incs product candidates irt ldn and irt menk   highlights immune therapeutics developed an oral adult low dose mg mg mgday formulation and pediatric oral liquid formulation  mgkgday of low dose naltrexone ldn  formulations are required for phase iii trials and this work took most of    this drug will be used in all trials both in the us and overseas in december  the national agency for food and drug administration and control nafdac in nigeria granted us permission with dr afonja as principal investigator to begin a day bridging trial for hivaids the objective of this bridging trial is to assure safety and tolerability as well as efficacy with the local population  the estimated completion date of this bridging trial is april  in december  we finalized the spin off of cytocom to our shareholders as part of the transaction we retained exclusive rights to all international patents incountry approvals formulations trademarks manufacturing marketing sales and distributions rights in emerging nations including africa central america south america russia india china far east and the commonwealth of independent states former soviet union  immune therapeutics will continue to have access to existing clinical data as well as any new data generated by cytocom during drug development in december of  we finalized the issuance of  shares of cytocom common stock to our shareholders of record that provided evidence of share ownership by december     in addition cytocom issued  shares of its common stock to immune therapeutics which has allowed us to retain a  stake in cytocom until such time as the funding for cytocom closes    in july  the republic of malawi approved lodonal as an adjunct for the treatment of cancer the brewer group inc a strategic partner paid for the first shipment of lodonal for malawi but was unable to ship the drugs due to issues with the importation of lodonal into malawi  those issues have been resolved and the brewer group and panam global logistics inc a company that will purchase and distribute lodonal will be able to ship lodonal in january of  in may of  we presented to audiences of doctors and scientists at the panafrican medical doctors  healthcare conference immunotherapy solutions that enhance immune health such as low dose naltrexone and ldn was accepted and endorsed by the healthcare professionals at the conference  the endorsement by leading doctors is an important part of our overall strategy  strategic goals new management team  negotiations with members of an experienced management team are virtually complete the new management is expected to begin by the middle of january of  conference attendance we intend to participate in a number of conferences both domestically and internationally about the value of lodonal as an immunomodulator for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer  these conferences include vi annual world congress on antiaging medicine am in mexico city february   and  the th international conference and exhibition on immunology in september in houston texas the complementary  alternative cancer therapies conference february  in west palm beach florida the academy of integrative health  medicine in san diego california october    and the rd annual world congress on antiaging medicine may  in hollywood florida  we believe attendance at these conferences will help generate sales    international regulatory approval for lodonal in  we expect to obtain regulatory approval for lodonal in some of the following countries in  south africa angola niger gabon egypt sri lanka and china we believe the process will take between  to  months depending on the local authorities establish partnerships in africa  our goal is to establish partnerships in africa with large employers that maintain onsite clinics there is increasing recognition that health creates wealth and advances gdp  hiv and aids have had an enormous negative impact on labor and productivity the vast majority of people living with hiv in africa are of working age  years old  we believe that lodonal can be used as a prophylactic to avoid many of the standard opportunistic infections accompanied with hiv and cancer funding cytocom clinical trials  if sales are sufficient our  goal in  is to commit financial resources to help fund cytocoms clinical trials in the us to validate the use of ldn in a number of various indications  clinical studies we have spent the last  months obtaining approval from nigeria and malawi to begin our clinical development program for lodonal as indicated above nafdac in nigeria granted us permission to begin a day bridging trial for hivaids and we expect to commence a day bridging trial for cancer in the first quarter of  in the republic of malawi on the regulatory front cytocom has held constructive dialogue with the fda with respect to appropriate trial designs and study protocols for irt and irt cytocoms immediate focus will be on crohns disease both in children and adults and we expect recruitment in both pharmacokinetic pk and dosing trials for irt ldn to begin this year in addition to the trial design we recently initiated a toxicologist and pk study in china for irt for the purpose of furthering our understanding of the effect of the pharmacokinetics of irt this will allow us to better understand the potential for drug interactions to further optimize treatment for phase  development of irt for cancer in both the us and china in addition the company expects to begin a bridging trial for cancer in malawi within the first quarter of  our strategy for growth over the past several months we have worked aggressively to build the business both upward and outward we have worked to build immune therapeutics into a multifaceted leader in immuno therapies by exploring opportunities beyond hivaids and cancer in emerging nations our goal and strategic vision is to build a diverse pipeline and to develop and commercialize novel drug treatments to improve the lives of patients suffering from chronic often lifethreating disease to fulfill these nearterm and longterm goals we are happy to report that we have obtained a loan commitment for up to two million dollars of which the first half a milliondollar tranche closed in december  and we expect the remaining funds to close by the end of january of  the loan is straight debt and does not convert into equity and will be repaid from revenue over the next three years this loan is transformational for the company it has allowed us to move ahead with our strategic goals to obtain international regulatory approval throughout africa and other emerging nations   we anticipate revenues in  from a number of sources including revenues from fees from the use of our formulation and patents and the sale of lodonal in nigeria malawi and equatorial guinea while we continue to execute this strategy in a capital efficient manner we plan to fuel the growth of our company by evaluating strategic financing options as well as licensing opportunities that will increase shareholder value the growth of immune therapeutics finally we have made an effort to build visibility and positive awareness of immune therapeutics by presenting at key investor and industry conferences internationally as a complement to our ongoing partnering efforts we are committed to enhancing communications with key investor groups in an effort to increase shareholder value by building appreciation for the immune therapeutics story upon the completion of the bridging trial in nigeria we will be able to fast track the approval process in a number of african nations that will accept nafdac approval of lodonal for the treatment of hivaids why hivaids hivaids still remains one of the three global public health threats this disease results in substantial morbidity mortality negative socioeconomic consequences and human suffering despite the significant increase in financial support and recent progress in addressing hivaids many obstacles and unmet priorities remain diseasespecific interventions must be developed to ensure successful treatments of this disease  apart from human suffering the associated high adult mortality caused by hivaids negatively impacts the socioeconomic development in some countries especially in nigeria and south africa adopting a treatment regimen for life that involves taking daily medication with potential side effects presents many challenges that must be overcome if patients are to successfully remain on treatment if drug resistance occurs through failure to adhere to antiretroviral treatments arvs far more expensive second line therapy may be necessary in some cases drugresistant strains of hiv are transmitted which can impact national treatment programs drug resistance has been found to be more prevalent the longer a country has provided antiretroviral therapies  we believe lodonal can provide an alternative in areas where patients have stopped taking their therapies due to side effects or cost lodonal has been shown in trials to lessen the toxic side effects of arvs  in those areas of the country where people must travel monthly for a medical check up and lose a days pay lodonal can costeffectively provide the ability to slow the progression of the disease without any toxic side effects  nigeria  in nigeria over  million people are living with hivaids with the annual number of new infections for adults at  and  for children currently only  people receive hiv treatment  the number of people living with hiv is only an estimate as very few nigerians know their hiv status  south africa  based on a wide range of data including the household and antenatal studies unaids estimated that hiv prevalence was  among  year olds at the end of  the high and low estimates were  and  respectively this implies that around  million south africans were living with hiv at the end of  including  children under  years old  by october  only two million people were receiving arvs  again the biggest problem is compliance as people are required to take pills  to  times a day at specific times and many times with food with considerable toxic side effects lodonal in contrast is taken only once per day does not have to be taken with food and has no toxic side effects why an adjunct to cancer treatment cancer is now one of the leading causes of death in developing countries already there are more deaths in the world from cancer than from aids tb and malaria combined specifically in africa facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer are minimal and in most cases there arent any cancer control programs in place it is estimated that subsaharan africa will see approximately a million new cancer cases this year and it is predicted that the number of new cases will double within the next decade additionally due to low cancer awareness in africa it is estimated  of all patients with cancer will not be seen until the cancer is in the advanced stage of the disease  even if the cancers were detected in the early stages there is inadequate access to effective treatment  therefore there is an urgent need of safe effect low cost treatments especially when you have to consider that anyone on chemotherapy must have a healthy immune system in conclusion as we continue to execute on our corporate strategy i would like to thank you personally for your

a number of different types of cancer the immune system is the bodies defensive system against infectious organisms such as bacteria viruses fungi parasites and most important – tumor cells the immune system includes many different defense cells such as macrophages t cells natural killer “nk” cells b cells and neutrophils cytokines are produced by the macrophages and the t cells and communicate with all of the cells in the immune system t cells include a group of cells that are described as killer cells that destroy viruses and tumor cells metenkephalin some times referred to as opioid growth factor ogf have been studied by a number of scientists but the most published of these are dr ian zagon and his team from pennsylvania state medical center at hershey extensively in relationship to growth – especially in cancer and dr nicholas plotnikoff in conjunction with bihari and dr ronald herberman and robert good in the treatment of hivaids and cancer much of this research has been carried out in the usa belgium croatia and germany professor ian s zagon and a research team a discovered that endogenous opioid peptides served as growth factors in subsequent studies these researchers found that one native opioid peptide – metenkephalin ogfmenk has been shown to regulate the growth of cancer cells the effect of ogfmenk is to delay the replication of cells the retarding of cell multiplication is often referred to as cytostatic cyto  cellular growth static  halt unlike chemotherapy ogfmenk does not directly destroy cancer cells and is not cytotoxic ogfmenk has been shown to halt the growth of the cells and is thought to allow immunological mechanisms eg macrophages natural killer cells to accomplish the task of destroying the cancerous cells ogfmenk also appears to work as an adjunct to chemotherapy when combined with traditional chemotherapy it shown to work in a more effective and less toxic manner immunoregulating properities phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of hivaids and cancer have shown that menkofg provided evidence for the treatment of hivaids as well as anticancer activity in kaposi sarcoma lung melanoma ovarian cervical head and neck pancreatic liver and renal cancer menkofg has been found to have immunostimulating and immunoregulating effects menkofg has been used to treat several autoimmune conditions in human subjects including multiple sclerosis uveitis behcet’s syndrome and optic neuritis boosting nk cell levels is essential in helping to beat cancer studies have demonstrated that ogf significantly raises nk natural killer cell levels although the mechanism by which this happens has not yet been fully clarified all the studies that have been carried out to date have consistently demonstrated the existence of ogf receptors in every type of malignancy that has been examined furthermore in addition to the clinical trials there is anecdotal evidence of a variety of cancers which respond to an ogfmenk boosting drug studies in animals have clearly determined that the mechanism for this response is through ogfogfr interaction it is therefore reasonable to assume that the responses to this ogfincreasing drug which have been anecdotally reported in humans are similarly mediated via ogf receptors the following cancers have either been shown to have ogf receptors andor have been anecdotally reported to respond to ogf andor ogf boosting mechanisms breast cancer cervical cancer colon rectal cancer gastric cancer glioblastoma head and neck kaposi’s sarcoma leukemia lymphocytic liver cancer lymphoma – b cell and t cell malignant melanoma neuroblastoma ovarian cancer pancreatic cancer prostate cancer renal cell carcinoma small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer throat cancer tongue cancer uterine cancer pancreatic cancer in laboratory studies zagon and his team discovered that ogfmenk which is involved in suppression of pain in the nervous system also controls the production of some cells both healthy and abnormal pancreatic cancer cells have ogf receptors that when bound with ogf inhibit additional cancer cell growth because cancer cells reproduce so quickly the body cannot produce enough ogfmenk to bind all of the receptors so cancer cell growth continues unimpeded zagon’s laboratory work suggested that providing enough ogfmenk in the body could bind the ogf receptors inhibit cancer cell proliferation and give the body’s own defenses time to battle the disease in phase i and phase ii clinical study sponsored by the national institutes of health zagon’s collaborator jill smith md professor of medicine penn state college of medicine enrolled  patients with advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer in one group ogf was administered intravenously in a saline solution over  minutes once per week in a second part of the study  patients were treated with  ugkg intravenous infusions of ogfmenl this time delivered over  minutes because the timing of drug delivery was extended there were no incidents of toxicity six other patients were treated with  ugkg ogf injections twice per day results showed that unlike the chemotherapeutic agents often used to treat pancreatic cancer ogfmenk did not cause white blood cell platelet or iron counts to drop and did not cause gastrointestinal problems nor were there side effects such as hair loss nausea or loss of appetite quality of life surveys administered before and during the study showed that patients had improved social interaction and alertness behavior improved sleep and rest mobility and communication pain and depression surveys showed a diminishment in pain scores at certain points during the therapy and that ogfmenk did not induce depression but may have actually prevented the development of depression in the terminally ill patients “although this study was not intended to examine tumor response or survival our preliminary results showed two patients with spread of the cancer to the liver responded with loss of metastases and survival was increased from  months under the typical treatment with gemcitabine to  months with ogf” zagon said “some patients survived from  to  months” the combination of ogf and gemcitabine also repressed the growth of another pancreatic cancer cell line panc mia paca cells transplanted into athymic mice received  mgkg ogf daily  mgkg gemcitabine every  days  mgkg ogf daily and  mgkg gemcitabine every rd day or  ml of sterile saline daily tumor incidence and latency times to tumor appearance of mice receiving combined therapy with ogf and gemcitabine was significantly decreased from those of the control ogf and gemcitabine groups tumor volumes in the ogf gemcitabine and ogfgemcitabine groups were markedly decreased from controls beginning on days   and  respectively after tumor cell inoculation tumor weight and tumor volume were reduced from control levels by – in the ogf andor gemcitabine groups on day  date of termination and the group of mice exposed to a combination of ogf and gemcitabine had decreases in tumor size of  and  from the ogf or the gemcitabine alone groups respectively this preclinical evidence shows that combined chemotherapy eg gemcitabine and biotherapy ogf provides an enhanced therapeutic benefit for pancreatic cancer cwswidgetcolcwsrowcwsrow colscol spancwswidget typetext title”therapeutic applications” upregulation of ogfr and consequent stimulation of the ogfogfr system are important for the antiproliferative effects of imidazoquinoline drugs like imiquimod and resiquimod which are immune response
