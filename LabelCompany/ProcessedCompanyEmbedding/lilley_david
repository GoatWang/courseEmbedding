politics of collapse and rebirth sku  your price  quantity would you like a signed copy by yuen davis  lilley  no thank youyes   overview we live in catastrophic times the world is reeling from the deepest economic crisis since the great depression with the threat of further meltdowns everlooming global warming and myriad dire ecological disasters worsen—with little if any action to halt them—their effects rippling across the planet in the shape of almost biblical floods fires droughts and hurricanes governments warn that there is no alternative to the bitter medicine they prescribe—or risk devastating financial or social collapse the right whether religious or secular views the present as catastrophic and wants to turn the clock back the left fears for the worst but hopes some good will emerge from the rubble visions of the apocalypse and predictions of impending doom abound across the political spectrum a culture of fear reigns  catastrophism explores the politics of apocalypse—on the left and right in the environmental movement—and examines why the lens of catastrophe can distort our understanding of the dynamics at the heart of these numerous disasters—and fatally impede our ability to transform the world lilley mcnally yuen and davis probe the reasons why catastrophic thinking is so prevalent and challenge the belief that it is only out of the ashes that a better society may be born the authors argue that those who care about social justice and the environment should jettison doomsaying—even as it relates to indisputably apocalyptic climate change far from calling people to arms they suggest catastrophic fear often results in passivity and paralysis—and at worst reactionary politics  praise   “catastrophism comes at the right moment  the year of the end proclaimed across the political spectrum from deep ecologists to the mayan calendarists instead of concentrating on the merits of the claims of the various apocalypticians jim davis sasha lilley david mcnally and eddie yuen examine the political function of these claims and find them to be deeply reactionary this is a controversial book that challenges many of the unexamined assumptions on the left as well as on the right it is a warning not to abandon everyday anticapitalist politics for a politics of absolute fear that inevitably leads to inaction” —silvia federici author of revolution at point zero housework reproduction and feminist struggle bravo this is the book that has been sorely needed for so long to reveal the deadend that a politics founded on catastrophic predictions must lead to in terms of either preventing them or actually changing the world  essential reading for all those on the left who are concerned with the question of strategy today leo panitch coauthor of the making of global capitalism “i cannot overstate how critically important this volume is catastrophism captures a problem that few have seriously grappled with anyone who wishes as i do for a new kind of occupied politics will have to face this formidable array of theoreticallyinspired reflections on the politics of apocalypse” —andrej grubacic coauthor of wobblies and zapatistas conversations on anarchism marxism and radical history in an age when even mayan prophecies of the end of the long cycle are turned into prophecies of doom and destruction this book offers a reasoned and lucid alternative understanding definitive and momentous this book should be mandatory reading for everyone who wishes to comprehend the world we live in and change it for the better —george katsiaficas author of asia’s unknown uprisings “this important book aims to end the politics of the end the authors of catastrophism claim that apocalyptic politics though promising to motivate revolutionary transformation all too often leads to a fearinduced paralysis and cynicism this book provides a badly needed boost to our political immunity systems against the apocalyptic claims bombarding us in this purported terminal year for our planet” —george caffentzis author of in letters of blood and fire “this groundbreaking book examines a deep current—on both the left and right—of apocalyptical thought and action the authors explore the origins uses and consequences of the idea that collapse might usher in a better world catastrophism is a crucial guide to understanding our tumultuous times while steering us away from the pitfalls of the past” —barbara epstein author of political protest and cultural revolution nonviolent direct action in the s and s
