improve quality of life for patients with joint pain schwartz biomedical llc of fort wayne indiana has received a  million  year grant from the indiana st century research and technology fund to investigate a novel material for use in human total joint replacements schwartz biomedical has been named the principal investigator on this project and is partnering with colorado state university fort collins colorado depuy orthopaedics warsaw indiana and the northeast indiana innovation center fort wayne indiana to develop market and commercialize a new bearing material because of today’s active life style total joint replacements are needed in younger and younger patients doctors are reluctant to perform joint replacement surgeries on these younger patients due to the limited life of some of the implant materials in addition much of the aging population remain active well into their latter stages of life and even an older active patient may be faced with the revision of their artificial joint due to the wearing out of the implant material in the case of many artificial total joints the plastic or polymer bearing component of the implant will experience wear and can be the limiting factor in the life of the total joint joint surface replacements a somewhat less invasive surgery and sometimes a first step prior to total joint surgery have experienced mixed clinical success due in part to the poor lubrication properties of the current bearing materials schwartz biomedical llc has licensed the technology from colorado state university csu and has partnered with the csu researchers to investigate a biologically enhanced self lubricating polymer bearing material that could be used in both total joint and surface replacement implants this technology developed by dr sue james at csu involves the chemical enhancement of the polymer material by combining it with a naturally occurring lubricant found in healthy human joints initial wear testing has shown that this enhancement results in a  reduction in wear when compared to the standard polymer currently used in joint replacement devices schwartz biomedical holds the license for this technology and intends to further research it’s applications into different areas within orthopaedics tissue engineering sports medicine spine etc schwartz biomedical llc is a tissue engineering company that generates and develops novel tissue engineering solutions to orthopaedic and oralmaxillofacial problems dr herb schwartz is the founder president and ceo of schwartz biomedical prior to founding his own company dr

careers biopoly™ rs llc biopoly™ llc schwartz biomedical awarded another grant  million fort wayne in — schwartz biomedical subsidiary biopoly llc has been awarded mm from indianas st century fund to develop a new orthopaedic implant called biopoly™ rs resurfacing which will be used to replace only the damaged portion of a joint ie knee hip shoulder phalanges etc as opposed to the entire joint patients receiving this new implant will not have to put up with chronic pain that many arthritis sufferers endure while they wait for their joint to deteriorate to the point where they are total joint replacement candidates according to herb schwartz phd president and ceo of schwartz biomedical llc and biopoly rs llc the grant will enable schwartz biomedical to complete its preclinical research and product development work as well as the fda submission which will allow the product to be sold as a medical device our timeline is aggressive according to schwartz product development should be complete within the next  years with the first implant ready for market launch in  in order to accomplish this goal janine campbell phd a principal scientist who specializes in chemistry has joined the schwartz biomedical team and will provide her expertise toward the commercialization of this technology schwartz biomedical has partnered with colorado state university and the northeast indiana innovation center to complete the development and commercialization of the biopoly™ rs implant technology the biopoly™ rs material platform is a hydrophilic polymer which has mechanical and biochemical properties similar to that of native articular cartilage so that the implant can interface and articulate with normal joint tissue therefore if the patient has a focal cartilage defect the surgeon will have a viable option of replacing or partially resurfacing only the damaged tissue with the biopoly™ rs implant such that the implant will physiologically share the biomechanical loads in
