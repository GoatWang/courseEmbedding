view case study to the content marina palms began as a broken project a choice piece of waterfront land on miami’s intercoastal with serious entitlement issues together with a local partner istar worked through the entitlement issues over two and a half years to position the property for the local markets resurgence now under construction marina palms is two exclusive condo towers framing the first fullservice marina built in miamidade county in twenty years this successful reposition has enabled our partnership to presell a substantial majority of the units prior to completing construction  south clark property type infillmixed use business line land  development location chicago il view case study to the content this  acre site in chicago’s south loop had been slated to become luxury condos but we saw it as better suited for premium rentals when istar took ownership we had the land and capital but needed a local builder’s vision and “knowhow” jdl had the local experience expertise and complementary ideas but needed a flexible capital solution most importantly we were on the same page from day one—quickly structuring a mutually beneficial joint venture with istar as both equity investor and lender as the story tower has risen our knowledge of both the local market and our partner’s capabilities has grown furthering the potential for additional partnerships la kapolei property type industrialrd business line operating properties location honolulu hi view case study to the content an industrial condo park strategically located in oahu’s second city la kapolei was poised to absorb the tourismrelated light industrial activity being forced out of honolulu unfortunately as the property neared completion the economy began sinking and our borrower struggled to finish the park pay contractors or sign any leases however we still believe in the original thesis when the borrower handed us the keys we paid off the liens and got the  buildings ready to occupy navigating the thorny legal and regulatory environment we restructured the condo plan and governance regime greatly reducing property taxes we brought in the best local industrial leasing agency and focused on local entrepreneurs and shortterm leases la kapolei leased up and when the leases started to roll a few years later the economy was back the park and its surroundings were thriving and larger tenants were lining up we started to field unsolicited bids and soon sold la kapolei for a profit van dyke commons property type retail business line operating properties location tampa bay fl view case study to the content a wellsituated power center mall in lutz florida just outside of tampa van dyke commons was in the process of being repositioned and improved when the new owner’s money ran out the first thing we did upon taking ownership was to restore the faith of the brokerage community making good on what they were owed and promising to pay faster than standard on new transactions we infused cash into the improvements cleaning up where corners had been cut we cleared out tenants that were in default renewed ten near term lease expirations and signed four new tenants to join the mall within  months the mall reached  occupancy and we sold it at a profit the ilikai hotel property type condoretail business line operating properties location honolulu hi view case study to the content this iconic hawaiian hotel had fallen into neglect and was mired in controversy when istar took ownership of the hotel portion of the story tower we worked hard to rebuild trust with the hotel employees and condo owners while investing in upgrades and a lobbyretail experience worthy of the ilikai’s name we secured permission to add kitchens to the hotel units and began selling them as condos it took a full mix of istar disciplines—architecture and engineering legal public relations finance operations—working in concert to bring to life the ilikai’s inherent value and best use paramount bay property type condo business line operating properties location miami fl view case study to the content paramount bay entered istar’s operating portfolio at the depth of the financial crisis shrouded in controversy its builder well over budget and the project incomplete rather than making conventional changes—new flooring and paneling an upgraded lobby—we sought to change the conversation entirely by hiring the interior design company of rock star lenny kravitz we relaunched paramount bay with a completely new perception the repositioned image and the improved quality of the product increased velocity and enabled istar and its partner to take advantage of the strengthening miami market ocean house property type condo business line operating properties location miami fl view case study to the content when istar assumed ownership of this highend condo development the units were decorator ready but the common areas had been valueengineered into unremarkable commodity spaces that belied the worth of such an exclusive location right on the ocean in miami’s south beach even the development’s name south of fifth was confusing since that was also the name of the neighborhood despite the market still in an early stage of climbing out of a trough we were optimistic about the market’s future and went all in on the property—giving it a new concept a new name and working with a premium designer a reengineered experience worthy of the location instead of a lobby the entry was made to feel like an exquisite home with a large living room butler pantry sweeping staircase and even a library the changes created a cachet for the property that brought in premium buyers and top dollar for these unique homes on the beach universal technical institute uti property type office business line net lease location lisle il view case study to the content uti a publicly traded company teaches people how to be mechanics for heavy machinery trucks and large engines as a longtime istar customer we knew them well and knew they were looking to replace their outmoded chicago campus we had an old building that was not suited for modern use but was well located right on interstate  and across the street from navistar—a producer of highend heavy machinery and a natural employer of uti’s students our pitch to uti we would tear down the building and construct a school on the property with purposebuilt facilities to accommodate their very specific needs and lease it to them through a joint venture entity in which uti would take part ownership leveraging our inhouse construction ability with our net lease and structuring expertise we solved uti’s needs in a creative and mutually beneficial manner while finding a higher and better use for an existing property in our portfolio solo cup property type industrialrd business line net lease finance type strategic investments location various view case study to the content when solo cup sought to refinance debt taken on in a significant merger they turned to istar our net lease transaction involved six of their manufacturing facilities that represented roughly threefourths of solo’s ebidta and included their most stateoftheart production lines we carefully underwrote the underlying business and recognized the stability of the cash flows due to the high switching costs of their customers in  following solo’s acquisition by dart container the new owners bought us out of the lease generating a significant roundtrip return on our investment w fort lauderdale property type mixed use business line real estate finance finance type first mortgage location fort lauderdale fl size  view case study to the content the w fort lauderdale exemplifies the creative tenacity it takes to see complex projects through we created an innovative structure to finance the separate hotel and condohotel components despite both being constructed concurrently and partnered with another lender to split the deal when markets turned difficult we offered flexibility through multiple modifications as the sponsor continued to support the deal through the infusion of fresh equity when our colender expressed interest in exiting we opportunistically acquired their position we were confident in our basis and value of the property believing it was just a question of when and not if the property would sell four months later the property sold at full value generating a strong return on our opportunistic acquisition  times square property type mixed use business line real estate finance finance type first mortgagemezzanine location new york ny size  view case study to the content in one of the worlds most densely trafficked locations we helped shepherd a deal to clear out an old office block and its downscale retail along th and broadway to create a property and an experience worthy of today’s times square as the deal progressed we financed over  million for a new edition hotel rising above six new floors of dynamic retail the hotel is being designed by a joint venture between marriott and ian schrager and will include significant outdoor space overlooking the heart of times square in addition an approximately  square foot led sign will become an iconic visual element and powerful presence in the square att drake hotel landmark apartment
