target retirement and lifestrategy funds at vanguard hold “investor” shares of the underlying funds rather than the less expensive “admiral” shares emily farrell head of us business pr at vanguard was kind enough to provide the answer —– piper why don’t the lifestrategy and target retirement funds use admiral shares as the underlying holdings or if there’s a concern about that being a way to “cheat” to get access to admiral shares without meeting the requirements why not have an admiral share class for the lifestrategy and target retirement funds with a higher minimum investment ie a high enough figure such that a person investing that amount via an identical diy allocation would qualify for admiral shares of all or most of the underlying funds farrell vanguard is unable to offer multiple share classes on funds of funds due to the structure in which we operate and the agreement we have with the sec regarding multiple share classes our funds of funds have no direct costs — the costs are derived only from the ers of the underlying funds according to that agreement we must be able to offer a differentiated cost advantage between share classes therefore because there is no direct cost associated with a fund of fund — it’s not possible for us to offer such an advantage as you may recall we launched a suite of institutional trfs in  note however those are not share classes — they are an entirely new set of mutual funds piper given that vanguard can only have one share class of a fundoffunds how does vanguard decide which share classes to hold within such funds the “normal” noninstitutional versions of the fundsoffunds each hold investor shares of the underlying funds would vanguard ever consider holding admiral share classes in these funds and for example the vanguard institutional target retirement  fund vtrlx holds institutional shares of one underlying fund admiral shares of another fund and investor shares of two funds what’s the line of thinking there farrell it is largely based on the cost to serve the underlying shareholder of the trf or lifestrategy fund these funds tend to attract small balance accounts and iras and the cost to serve is disproportionately higher than funds with large and diverse shareholders in terms of looking into adding holding admiral in the investor suite of trfs in short the answer is yes — we consistently review our products product structures and product lineups however given the size of the average trf account and our cost allocation methodologies we would not expect a change from investor shares specific to the underlying holdings of the institutional suite of trfs again it is cost to service the funds and our cost allocation methodologies that dictate the share class utilized —– so to paraphrase vanguard’s position here is “in a target retirement or lifestrategy fund we hold whichever share class or share classes result in an expense ratio that most closely reflects the cost to service the fund’s shareholders” in hindsight that feels sort of obvious given vanguard’s general “at cost” pricing philosophy new to investing see my related book investing made simple investing in

by larry ludwig published on july   last modified july   editor rating rated  stars use vanguard to get a wide selection of lowcost noload mutual funds etfs stock broker services and financial planning for investors wanting a onestop shop for all their banking and financial needs youll have to look elsewhere the vanguard group is the grand daddy of lowcost indexed based mutual fund investing started in  by jack bogle he understood over  of actively managed funds did not beat the market’s indices his mantra is you aren’t best to beat the market you should become the market and focus on low cost fees vanguard has grown to become the world’s largest no load mutual fund company while vanguard is mostly known for its lowcost index funds they also offer a variety of lowcost actively managed mutual funds and exchangetraded funds etfs vanguard also provides brokerage services variable and fixed annuities educational account services financial planning asset management and trust services in the same spirit of shedding further insight on the different investment options available to consumers today i wanted to share with you my experiences with vanguard’s investment services personally i have been a vanguard account holder since  overall i have found vanguard offers a wide selection of mutual funds and etfs at a low cost but their website to be somewhat outdated and clunky vanguard features minimum deposit  stock trades  –  options trades  –   contract mutual funds  accounts available traditional ira roth ira rollover ira annuities and individual mobile app yes — apple ios and google android customer service phone promotions none account options currently vanguard offers the following account options beside each type of account i’ve included a brief summary of my experiences where applicable k rollovers to a vanguard ira – this type of account enables you to transfer your k retirement account at your previous employer and convert it to a traditional ira with vanguard i completed this process in with my wife’s b with a former and the process was executed without any failures or delays and better yet there were no additional penaltiesfees incurred by the process from vanguard annuities – vanguard offers both fixed income and variable annuities while i don’t personally have one of these i understand vanguard has some of the lowest rates in the industry for annuities this is mostly because they don’t have fulltime sales people selling their product and pass the discount onto you roth iras and traditional iras – vanguard gives investors the option of opening either a traditional pretax contributions or roth posttax contributions ira i have been using a roth ira from vanguard for  years now and i have found it a very effective investment vehicle with their low cost mutual funds individual taxable accounts – lastly vanguard allows you to save money in taxable accounts in either stocks bonds cds or mutual funds investment types the vanguard group offers a very comprehensive array of investment options regardless of the type of account you choose to open this review focuses only on vanguard’s “breadandbutter” – mutual funds and etfs vanguard mutual funds  total mutual funds – including money market international balanced bond reit and stock mutual funds vanguard offers both actively stock picking and passively tracking an index managed mutual funds offers lower fee “admiral shares” mutual fund options these shares generally require a balance in the mutual fund of at least  however the expense ratio for these admiral shares is generally  lower than that of the normal mutual fund shares vanguard etfs in addition to mutual funds vanguard has also become a major player in the etf markets currently offering  different etfs in the majority of the same areas that they offer mutual funds generally etfs have expense ratios  lower than the same asset class of mutual fund while this is not a huge difference it can add up over the years with larger account balances in most cases especially if you have complete control over your investment account you would want to choose the vanguard etfs over their mutual funds not only are most cheaper but typically are more tax efficient fees and commissions vanguard charges no commission for trading their mutual funds and etfs purchasing stocks and non vanguard etfs through vanguard can be expensive this isn’t surprising since their focus is on low cost mutual funds stock and etf fee schedule amount stocks and etfs less than   for the first  trades  for subsequent trades – all trades  –  million all trades   million plus free for first  trades  for subsequent trades unless you have a somewhat large account with them vanguard isn’t a great place to trade stocks you are best to use other discount brokerages vanguard’s service is lacking features when comparing to other discount stock brokers based upon experience though if you are wanting to use vanguard you are only interested in purchasing vanguard only mutual funds and etfs for other discount brokers please visit our best stock broker web page minimum balance and initial deposit generally the minimum investment amount for vanguard mutual funds is  which is somewhat steep for the first time investor however for vanguard etfs the minimum is only  share and might be best suited for beginning investors vanguard also offers admiral shares which have even lower in annual fees to qualify invest  or more in most vanguard index funds that offer admiral shares invest  or more in vanguard actively managed funds that offer admiral shares vanguard recently lowered the dollar requirements and is great news for investors mutual fund and etf screener find the best vanguard fund or etfclick to enlargevanguards screener is a very effective tool to find the right fund that meets your investing criteria you can filter based upon asset class minimum deposit risk level share class and tax efficiency once you find the right vanguard fund for you you can invest directly you can also compare the various funds to find out which performed better it’s a useful tool since vanguard has over  etfs and mutual funds customer service overall the ease of use of the online vanguard system and corresponding customer service has always been very effective and straightforward whenever i am unable to figure out something online it is always easy to get a real live person on the phone who is knowledgeable and can assist vanguard portfolio watch recommended asset allocationclick to enlargethe portfolio analysis tool is provided for free by vanguard you can gain insight in to your asset allocation as well as the overall costs of taxes and manage risks associated with your portfolio their summary section it will give automated recommendations to modify your portfolio it does not support external accounts into asset allocation consideration this is another example of the vanguard only centric view their service has summary vanguard is great if you use their funds and etfs when you venture outside of this realm their service is ok at best if you ever decide to buy individual stocks you are best to find another stock broker for that purpose vanguard’s research tools are almost nonexistent unless you have a significant amount invested with them it may not make sense to use their service for the lower trading fees it is assumed you go for vanguard only for their low cost indexed mutual funds and etfs though they are no longer have exclusivity in this area most mutual fund houses offer similar and in some cases lower annual fees when compared to vanguard many of the brokers offer commission free etfs further lowering your transaction costs to match vanguard i recommend using vanguard for your retirement account if possible there are many poor alternatives unfortunately or if you prefer to use only

“systems problem” that it had been fixed but it just kept happening recently my taxable settlement account balance suddenly and incorrectly dropped from just over  to  it isn’t even a margin account it took several days to fix this i have been unsuccessful at trying to reach a manager it seems like they just don’t care anymore needless to day i am researching options to transfer my ira just over

trying to transfer an ira to vanguard and after  weeks i finally gave up and transferred the account to a different brokerage my account representative is still very responsive and is trying to help

at fidelity where transferred amounts go straight into a cash reserves account granted it was his fault but to rectify it vanguard wanted to charge him  per sale transaction which would have come to a total of  so much for lowfee investing the attitude of the customer service rep we spoke to was more or less “too bad so sad sucks to be you” so as of tomorrow he will be joining me as a happy

for  years i think your comments are quite correct i don’t trade individual stocks so using vanguard funds works well for me though i have several fidelity funds that i occasionally feel i should just move over to vanguard my wife has her entire investment portfolio with fidelity has done quite well as she asked me to select more aggressive funds for her back in the late s and they have done well vanguard does have one advantage for new investors you can invest with just  with their popular star fund it is a good balanced fund consisting of some of vanguard’s best mutual funds this fund of funds has been modified over the years and has become a bit more aggressive thus enhancing returns the forprofit nature of fidelity leads some i think to lean more toward vanguard still some of fidelity’s funds with higher expense ratios still do better overall than vanguard’s comparable funds so going with one over the other is a matter of personal preference        reply   hide replies

account from moving because they refuse to provide redemption paperwork despite numerous requests for a simple form so far they have kept my account hostage and won’t even provide paperwork in order

back on that they give many people trouble getting their funds out that they complicate every little error they or you make with their “byzantine bureaucracy” and generally make old customers realize that this company has turned into a monster that is simply coasting on it’s former reputation for integrity if this is true we need to know nothing else matters if they are not trustworthy if they are adversarial with clients who wants to fight all time with a big company over one’s money please look into this and give us some idea if they are still a high integrity company thanks        reply   hide replies ∧mike years  months agosteve i’ve had an account with vanguard and until recently really liked the firm i encouraged a number of friends and family to switch over to vanguard based on their lower fees however i’ve had a recent experience that has totally reversed my faith and confidence in vanguard i was asked by vanguard to “upgrade” an established mutual fund account with the firm to a brokerage account essentially the “upgrade” was of no real benefit to me but it was explained to me would make some of the accounting easier for vanguard so i agreed to the “upgrade” turns out the “upgrade” triggered a compliance issue as vanguard no claimed it was unable to verify my identity and it froze all of my account at vanguard i was unable to access or trade when some significant movement was taking place in the market despite repeated call to vanguard no one there is able to make a logical decision the firm created the issue and does not follow the actual requirements of the lawsregulations it claims are imposed upon it by the federal government instead vanguard’s cip program is flawed and not consistient with the actual code of federal regulations that governs brokerdealer transactions vanguard simply refuses to recognize that its compliance policy is out of sync with the cfr it claims to be following i was so troubled by the matter i took the time and effort to file a complaint with finra i am not sure how much control finra will decide to exercise with vanguard but common sense seem to be in extremely short supply at vanguard for them to ask a customer to upgrade one of their accounts and then turn around and manafacture a bogus identity conflict and freeze the customer’s account is a sign that the firm is experience difficulties and might be a sign of future problems on the horizon the inability to correct a simply mistake created by vanguard and the firms willingness to alienate an otherwise loyal client is inexcusable hopefully finra can interject some logic into vanguard and if nothing else at least ensure that their compliance policy are actually in sync with the regulations as opposed to be just vague assertains of fantasy by vanguard when you check online you can see tons of complaints by clients and mostly now former clients of vanguard of events similar to mine where vanguard self creates a client identity problem and locks the client out i would suspect that as others have suggest vanguard staff is now composed of younger less experienced individuals that simply don’t take the time to know what is proper or just operate by knee jerk reactions it’s sad but i can not recommend vanguard at this point what good are lower fees if in the end the firm creates more problems for you and wastes your time so easily it only foreshadows likely future problems and frustrations maybe paying a higher fee is worth it if you can deal with competient representatives and have confidence that your funds are

and i are looking to roll over moneys into vanguard – but my wife read discouraging reviews by investors who complained it was hard to get their money out of vanguard in a timely matter wondering if anyone can offer insights into this aspect we are in it for the long haul – but there will come a time when we will need to remove money from vanguard thanks        reply   hide replies ∧dr years  months agoi have accounts at both vanguard and fidelity i have a significantly larger account at vanguard yet the level of competence is much lower at vanguard what is noticeable  vanguard customer service is far inferior it is often like talking to a federal employee ready to retire  waiting for a coffee break at the same time you can never get the same person to follow up on anything and they don’t seem particularly competent or care how much of your time you waste  they have a really hard time understanding how to transfer assets and always get you to someone who doesn’t understand  there inherited asset transfer process is a time consuming waste for  months i worked on have assets transferred to vanguard hours  hours  hours of time always someone new always different info today on the phone with vanguard for another  hours   minutes all the while the funds were put in cash  months ago when my transfer paperwork was completed finally i picked up the phone to fidelity and had instant great knowledgeable customer service with the individual offering to be my point of contact vanguard is not worth the trouble  the employees seem complacent and seem to lack the drive and initiative to get something done the annuity department in particular needs to get a little staff change hope i save some one the trouble if the going gets slow  wastes your time over at vanguard quit while you are ahead it won’t get better        reply   hide replies ∧lmoney years  months agofrom vgd website for mutual fund accounts –  fee waived for shareholders who have elected to receive statements and

indexes and trading stocks and options        reply   hide replies ∧aquinas years  months agojust read this yearold thread and will add one point vanguard generally gets high marks as a fiduciary because it is a notforprofit company it’s neither privately owned as fidelity is nor publicly traded on the stock market as many mutual fund companies are so vanguard has to answer only to its customers–they own the funds–and not to peopleshareholders who own shares of the company that’s one reason the fees are low the only other mutual fund company like this is tiaacref see david swenson’s book unconventional success for further details        reply   hide replies ∧lindsay year  months agohow does that work exactly that vanguard brokerage managers have to answer to their customerowners i don’t see customers organizing and running vanguard the truth seems to be that the inmates managers are in charge of the asylum and while the funds seem to work very well the brokerage is a disaster which is why so many people are complaining about errors huge delays getting things done or fixed and egregiously bad customer service as someone else said here corporate managers seem to hide behind

if i have issues or questions i have heard very good things about both fidelity and vanguard i like the local presence of the fidelity offices and advisors and the low costs of vanguard about vanguard

  hide replies ∧jacob  my personal finance journey years  months ago krantcents – i have wished the same thing as well about my previous employers using vanguard every past employer of mine has used

more variety goes – what types of products do you wish they had        reply   hide replies ∧krantcents years  months agowhen i compare vanguard to fidelity there are more funds in many more sectors

on the bidask etc and there’s a lot to say for consolidating everything with vanguard especially for those companies that you want to buy and hold for a long time if you’re self employed vanguard makes it very easy to set up a simple or sep as well i haven’t looked into an individual k account but they probably do that too        reply   hide replies ∧investor junkie years  months agovanguard does offer an individual k account httpsinvestorvanguardcomwhatweoffersmallbusinessindividualk i don’t have a simple sep or individual k account with them but more than likely this year or next i like their fee structure with regards to vanguard and stock trading i would say that they are really best suited to only own their funds and etfs imho other mutual funds and stocks you are best opening an account somewhere else since it really isn’t their focus if you have less than k it’s possible you’ll pay  a trade ouch at least for me consolidating into one vendor doesn’t do anything for me using products like quicken and a spreadsheet it’s not that hard to determine things like proper asset allocation        reply   hide replies ∧robert m years  months agoone could argue that if you have less

scottrade tradeking or other would probably be better        reply   hide replies ∧jacob  my personal finance journey years  months ago robert – that’s actually a very intriguing question about the bidask spread and how it varies between “wellestablished” investment houses and deepdiscount brokerages i think i’ll put that on my list of things to research and post on        reply   hide replies ∧david years  months agohmm so now a follow up question is it a good idea to move money i have from similar sp  index fund with  fee to this fund with  less fees the challenge is that it’s had about  gain since i bought it so i’ll have some capital gains while capital gains taxes may be higher in the future i could lose by not have as much to invest now i guess it depends on how the market performs in the future        reply   hide replies ∧investor junkie years  months agohmm sounds like a lot of variables involved with this one i see – amount invested – how long you plan on keeping it invested in the sp  – is it long term or short term capital gains the primary question is how long do you plan on keeping it the longer you own it the more it will drift from the sp  because of the said fees the tax rates while more than likely will be higher than current is an unknown i wouldn’t consider the future market valuation since that’s constant no matter which fund you own        reply   hide replies ∧david years  months agowell i disagree future market valuation makes a big difference… if the market goes way up then staying where i am makes the best sense the fee is only a tiny percentage and what i would be paying in taxes this year is earning returns if the market is flat then the fee takes away all the returns and it’d have been better to pay gains now and have less fees of course we all hope the market goes way up in the long run… the amount invested should not make a difference but it’s enough that i’m worrying about a  fee i plan on holding it a long time        reply   hide replies ∧jacob  my personal finance journey years  months ago david – agree with inv junkie it’s a fairly difficult question to know whether now is the correct time to transfer from your higher cost fund to one with vanguard even though i am not a professional money advisor i would say that i would personally move my fund due to the fact that i would prefer to have all of my funds in one place and since vanguard offers so many low cost mutual funds i would know that there would be other funds that i could find useful in the future        reply   hide replies ∧investor junkie years  months agooh i see what you are getting at yes from the perspective of paying taxes so you can transfer to another account maybe the best way to do it is sell shares when forced to rebalance your sp  allocation if you believe in shiller’s pe then in the next  years it’s expected we’ll have another round of poor returns though that indicator has been show to be far from perfect

neither has a trading fee with them it really comes down the the bidask spread is the major issue even then with etfs like vanguard’s sp  that’s traded frequently it’s a very small difference right now i show the spread is  with voo httpsfinanceyahoocomquotevoopvoo etfs that aren’t traded as much this can be a bigger factor the other i’ve seen discussed is tax advantages though i’m not sure really what kind of advantage either would have since they are about as efficient as possible the biggest issue with any of them is the tracking error i’ve created a graph on morningstar’s web site comparing the differences in said mutual funds and etfs httprijcceqnqng – vanguard  index admiral  – vanguard sp  etf  – fidelity spartan  index inv  – sp   i showed the past ten years what would k be worth today includes dividends granted this graph is somewhat misleading since vanguard’s etf just started in  if you do one year vanguard’s etf and mutual fund are almost the same though if you compared the three funds compared to what the sp would be worth the vanguard  index admiral is slightly better for most people just starting out it looks like vanguard’s etf is a better deal when

its long list of lowcost mutual funds vanguard has added a full menu of exchangetraded funds etfs to its lineup making the company one of the leading providers for both investment products most vanguard index mutual funds have a corresponding etf both products are very similar in management style and returns but there are differences that can make one product more appropriate than another vanguards products also carry expense ratio differences between mutual fundetf pairs that must be examined to make the best choice the difference between mutual funds and etfs tradability of shares is the most significant difference between mutual funds and etfs mutual fund shares price only once at the end of the trading day investors can place trade orders throughout the day but the transaction is only completed at the end of the trading day etfs carry more flexibility they trade like stocks and can be bought and sold throughout the day in many cases etfs carry lower expense ratios than their mutual fund counterparts but they must be traded in a brokerage account etf trades could come with brokerage commission fees investors must decide between a buyandhold strategy or a trading strategy to determine which product may be more advantageous the difference between vanguards investor class and admiral class shares the mutual fund versus etf debate for vanguard products in part comes down to how much is being invested most vanguard mutual funds come with  minimum initial investments but some can be initiated with a  investment initial investments of  or more are eligible for the companys lowercost admiral share class these are essentially the same products as the investorclass shares but they come with cheaper expense ratios the admiral class shares tend to outperform their investor class share counterparts comparing vanguard investor class mutual fund shares to etfs the popular vanguard  index fund and the vanguard sp  etf provide good examples of the cost and trading differences that come with mutual funds and etfs although most mutual funds and etfs in the vanguard lineup follow a similar pattern the  index fund comes with an expense ratio of  while the sp  etf has a much lower expense ratio of just  on a  investment investors are paying  a year in expenses in the mutual fund as opposed to  with the etf the overall cost difference is minor but it could make a difference for an investor who wants to put the money in an account and leave it untouched until retirement conversely an investor who wants a little more trading flexibility would opt for the etf although the trading commissions from a few trades could make it more costly overall the choice often comes down to investor preference comparing vanguard admiral class mutual fund shares to etfs when considering the admiral shares of the vanguard  index the decision between the mutual fund and etf changes this funds expense ratio is  which is identical to the etfs expense ratio this makes the mutual fund just as advantageous as the etf for longterm buyandhold investors only investors who trade throughout the day would find the etf more desirable investors who want to trade but are comfortable with the onceaday pricing of mutual funds are likely to find that product more beneficial since there would be no transaction fees involved if they are traded through vanguard directly conclusion the decision between a vanguard mutual fund or a vanguard etf comes down to trading flexibility and the amount to be invested the vanguard portfolio of investment choices as a whole is

shares one question i receive periodically is why the target retirement and lifestrategy funds at vanguard hold “investor” shares of the underlying funds rather than the less expensive “admiral” shares emily farrell head of us business pr at vanguard was kind enough to provide the answer —– piper why don’t the lifestrategy and target retirement funds use admiral shares as the underlying holdings or if there’s a concern about that being a way to “cheat” to get access to admiral shares without meeting the requirements why not have an admiral share class for the lifestrategy and target retirement funds with a higher minimum investment ie a high enough figure such that a person investing that amount via an identical diy allocation would qualify for admiral shares of all or most of the underlying funds farrell vanguard is unable to offer multiple share classes on funds of funds due to the structure in which we operate and the agreement we have with the sec regarding multiple share classes our funds of funds have no direct costs — the costs are derived only from the ers of the underlying funds according to that agreement we must be able to offer a differentiated cost advantage between share classes therefore because there is no direct cost associated with a fund of fund — it’s not possible for us to offer such an advantage as you may recall we launched a suite of institutional trfs in  note however those are not share classes — they are an entirely new set of mutual funds piper given that vanguard can only have one share class of a fundoffunds how does vanguard decide which share classes to hold within such funds the “normal” noninstitutional versions of the fundsoffunds each hold investor shares of the underlying funds would vanguard ever consider holding admiral share classes in these funds and for example the vanguard institutional target retirement  fund vtrlx holds institutional shares of one underlying fund admiral shares of another fund and investor shares of two funds what’s the line of thinking there farrell it is largely based on the cost to serve the underlying shareholder of the trf or lifestrategy fund these funds tend to attract small balance accounts and iras and the cost to serve is disproportionately higher than funds with large and diverse shareholders in terms of looking into adding holding admiral in the investor suite of trfs in short the answer is yes — we consistently review our products product structures and product lineups however given the size of the average trf account and our cost allocation methodologies we would not expect a change from investor shares specific to the underlying holdings of the institutional suite of trfs again it is cost to service the funds and our cost allocation methodologies that dictate the share class utilized —– so to paraphrase vanguard’s position here is “in a target retirement or lifestrategy fund we hold whichever share class or share classes result in an expense ratio that most closely reflects the cost to service the fund’s shareholders” in hindsight that feels sort of obvious given vanguard’s general “at cost” pricing philosophy new to
