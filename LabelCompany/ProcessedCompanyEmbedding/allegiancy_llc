home if you don’t take care of the chickens they’ll die that matters on a farm you learned to innovate in a very rural way to make sure a job got finished it might take baling wire and duct tape but the important thing was to improvise to finish the task until you could get the right part it takes creativity ingenuity and a sense of urgency those essential values are at the heart of our
