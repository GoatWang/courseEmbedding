tailored brands  misunderstood and grossly undervalued  tailored brands inc nysetlrd  seeking alphasign in  join nowgoÂ»tailored brands  misunderstood and grossly undervaluedjul   about tailored brands tlrd casita capital deep value longshort equitysummarycompany has the biggest market share in tuxedo rentals a sector that has proven difficult for online only competitors and has an inelastic customer demand profilemanagement is focused on reducing leveragecompany is free from headline distractions such as american airlinestwin hill and the failed macys partnershipthe good stuff here is where i think tailored brands nyse tlrd stock can go in the next  months base case  probability  share bear case  probability  share bull case  probability  share company overview tailored brands is a mens specialty apparel retailer offering formal clothing business casual sportswear outerwear shoes and accessories and tuxedo rentals the company currently operates through  primary segments mens wearhouse targets male customers aged  and offers a selection of exclusive and nonexclusive merchandise jos a banks targets male customers aged  and offers tailored and business casual clothing and accessories substantially all under the jos a bank label moores is a canadian retail store chain offering a similar product as mens wearhouse stores as well as tuxedo rentals kg offers valueoriented superstore approach to appeal to price sensitive male and female customers in the apparel market corporate apparel twin hill and dimensions uk provides corporate clothing uniforms for workforces eg british airways ups nyseups mcdonalds nysemcd the company makes money through these brands by renting tuxedos selling apparel and accessories and providing corporate apparel the bulk of my piece is focused on tuxedos because that is where i see the core value why is this business valuable the underlying value for tailored brands lies in its rental offering the company maintains a substantial share of the market with close to rd of the bn industry in the us this business is largely wedding and prom related making the demand for such services more inelasticrecession proof in the midst of a recession high school students still go to proms and a grooms wedding party will require formalwear a relatively minor expense compared to other aspects of the wedding from a financial standpoint the company is able to make compelling returns on its investments in tuxedo product from multiple rentals for example the company has recently been investing mm in new working capital for cash gross margins of mm from tuxedo rentals this does not include rent for the stores out of which they operate but highlights the direct return on investment for the specific product why is tuxedo rental important to valuation its recession proof or at least more so than most retail offerings department stores are risky because they sell apparel that a consumer can easily cut spending on when times get tough they also get a material  of revenue from credit card income which is linked to store credit cards and are susceptible to higher consumer default rates in a downturn the opposite is true for tuxedo rentals given the more inelastic demand profile of prom and wedding party attendees amazon nasdaqamzn every business in retail needs to prove how it can compete vs amazon long term mens wearhouse is able to compete today because of its national footprint that allows wedding parties to go into any store and get measured by a tailor for tuxedos in the same style for an event current online competitors have not been able to get critical capacity because they lack the footprint of mens wearhousejos a bank in the us i estimate the combined revenue of online competitors eg black tux menguin and generation tux to be mm a far cry from tlrds mm business in fact black tux just announced a recent partnership with nordstrom nysejwn to have a shopinshop experience this is interesting because it highlights the need for an instore experience and because tlrd recently had trouble making a partnership with macys nysem profitable tlrd was attracted to macys bridal registry business as a way to drive traffic but it did not pan out as anticipated it will be exciting to see how black tux fares in nordstrom but the most recent example shows that the concept doesnt work well in a department store why is the stock near alltime lows idiosyncratic and macro headlines have plagued the stock over the past  months the apparel sector showed weakness starting in december as holiday sales were weaker than anticipated across the board that weakness persisted into  as tax refund delays materially impacted january and february sales for most retailers additionally the fear of amazon has only grown and the launch of prime wardrobe and corresponding selloff across apparel retailers is just another sign of investor anxiety however i believe that the tuxedo rental business and tailored suiting will protect tlrd vs amazon for the foreseeable future the macys partnership was a huge drag on fiscal  guidance when tlrd reported q results in march at the time the company estimated a mm negative to operating income as a result of the partnership or roughly  eps taking eps to the range of  vs  in may they announced they were able to exit the partnership and would realize onetime charges to do so the revised guidance still includes a mm loss from the partnerships operating loss ytd if that loss is excluded given its nonrecurring nature the eps range is comparable to the share range that i back into in q excluding similar charges as a note it was rare this earnings season to find a retailer that beat q eps consensus estimates and at least maintained full year guidance both of which tlrd achieved american airlines nasdaqaaltwin hill there has been a large amount of press on the health issues aa flight staff have raised over the corporate apparel rollout that twin hill provided at the end of the day twin hill maintained proper standards and further tests did not reveal any illegal actions or poor standards from aas perspective that doesnt resolve an unhappy workforce and they caved to their demands to explore other providers of uniforms in the future as these complaints did not seem to die down the financial impact to tlrd is minimal the ebitda from aa given its replenishment nature tlrd already sold them the product and are just maintaining it now is minimal around  of total company ebitda by my estimates in fact the entire corporate apparel segment was only mm ebitda of the mm ebitda in fiscal  or  the company did not shift fiscal guidance when the nonrenewal of the contract was announced likely showing the impact is negligible tlrd was also able to win a contract as  of  suppliers for mcdonalds usa uniforms in the midst of the negative aa publicity that highlights tlrds ability to compete and the sustainability of its reputation my view is that tlrd views corporate apparel as noncore and may be looking to sell that business to a larger player and use the funds to delever the balance sheet lastly the companys cfo and general counsel both bought shares in the open market the day before the twin hillamerican air contract nonrenewal was announced again highlighting its negligible impact why would they buy before instead of after if its materially negative eminence exit eminence capital is a hedge that had a  stake in tlrd the firms cio was nominated by tlrds bod this year to join them instead he withdrew his candidacy and his firm sold their stake close to share after paying nearly share for the last mm shares a few months prior the market may have taken that as a negative signal that a large hedge fund thats backing the company and its story was effectively pulling its support by selling its position i disagree as it was eminences push that click on link and start at mins was a primary reason why mens wearhouse eventually overpaid for jos a banks i dont believe these distractions suggest a deterioration in the core tuxedo rental or tailored offering of tlrd one could argue that top brass especially the ceo given his tenure may be at fault for letting these distractions happen in the first place i believe not even current management could ruin the value of the business balance sheet tlrd is overlevered today for a retailer however the companys excess cash flow has been earmarked for debt reduction and management has proven they are committed to reducing debt in the past  months tlrd has repurchased mm bonds in the open market at a discount to par reducing the note outstanding to mm from mm they have also made excess cash flow sweep payments as mandated by the credit agreement on the floating rate term loan currently they maintain a dividend of around mm per year they could allocate that cash to debt repayment but management likely does not want to send an erroneous message that they are worried about liquidity given the most recent forecast for improved cash flow yoy in  the company should be able to generate mm of cash after the dividend and mandatory term loan amortization payments that is ample cash for nearterm debt reduction further reducing leverage and interest expense an interesting item to keep track of is how resistant bond prices have been compared to the stock its unusual to see a dramatic divergence in bondequity prices in a leveraged retailer with no hard assets eg real estate but i think it demonstrates that bond investors have a better understanding of the value and cash flow nature of the business than equity investors at the moment other items to keep track of are  maturities arent a risk as the nearest term facility is the term loan in   the abl facility remains undrawn and  the company has sizable credit facility baskets that would allow it to tap the secured debt markets if the business got worse and it needed the cash that last point is important when considering the downside as it allows the company to maintain a lifeline in a bearish scenario valuation in the current market environment retailers pe and ebitda multiples have come under pressure investors group think has left them to believe that most of the businesses wont survive an amazon world or more likely in my view the next economic downturn that means that despite the fact a retailer has an attractive valuation either on a historical basis or relative to other competitors investors have shied away given my view that tlrds core business is defensible i think it has the merits of a value investment and not a value trap the company will be able to generate mm of cash flow to equity this year  free cash flow to equity assuming mid mm of ebitda mm capex mm cash interest and mm of mandatory term loan paydowns it trades at x the low end of my eps for  share comparable to gnc which is a business in a much worse place as far as fundamentals and balance sheet tlrd also continues to pay an above market dividend  in my view a qoq uptick in comps into q in addition to investor awareness of the true value of tlrd will lead to a massive appreciation in the stock over the next  months my base case price is share based on an x pe ratio of my  eps forecast as investors realize how defensible the business model is my bullish case sees shares trading closer to share lastly and important to any investor in a retail stock i see downside at share given the value in tux and liquiditybalance sheet strength the next important catalyst is q earnings in september followed by a likely management roadshow with institutional investors on the east coast the first one in some time many retailers have free cash flow yields in the  context likely a result of investor fear of declining cash flows in the neartomedium term due to a variety of reasons amazon economic concerns high fixed expense due to leased stores if we were to value tlrd in that range here is a sensitivity for share price to different free cash flow and free cash flow yields keep in mind my estimate of mm free cash flow in  other items short interest is upwards of  due in part because of its classification as an apparel retailer and market group think to short all brick and mortar retailers as the business moves past the american air and macys distractions comps begin to stabilize cash flow improves and management meets investors i think a short squeeze could significantly amplify a rally in this name as it did in q and q in  finally the sell side research on this stock is limited at best only three firms equity research departments publish on tlrd db wunderlich and johnson rice i would argue that one reason this long opportunity exists is that so few eyeballs are paying attention to it disclosure i amwe are long tlrd i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it i have no

president and chief executive officer of tailored brands stated fiscal  was a year of significant strategic progress for tailored brands as we executed on our plans to rightsize our store base optimize our cost structure and return jos a bank to a path of sustained profitable growthÂ  i am pleased with our delivery on our operational initiatives that we established for  Â we closed  stores under our store rationalization program we achieved over  million in cost savings through our profit improvement plan and we stabilized and began to turn around jos a bank Â with a focus on continued operational excellence we have built a strong foundation for future growthunfortunately the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands which drove lower than anticipated fourth quarter and full year net sales and gross marginsÂ  despite this we delivered near the midpoint of our full year adjusted eps guidance through disciplined expense management and a
