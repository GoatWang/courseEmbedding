expertise to develop and market nutritionalsnack foods that are appropriate for evening snacking our first product is the nightfood nutrition bar currently available in two flavors cookies n’ dreams and midnight chocolate crunch   development plans   longerterm assuming that we have established sufficient traction with our initial product the nightfood nutrition bar the company intends to evaluate opportunities to introduce other nighttime specific snack products in the snack formats already popular with consumers such as cookies chips and ice cream   we believe the nutritional profile of any popular snack food can be evaluated and formulated for what we call “sleepfriendliness” and therefore optimized as a better nighttime snack option   the company is also evaluating opportunities to acquire other companies in related spaces in november  the company executed and delivered a plan of reorganization including option to acquire the “plan” by and among the company hook group llc “hook” and suffield foods llc “suffield” the plan contemplates the registrant acquiring an equity interest in and potentially merging hook and its subsidiary suffield with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  this transaction has not closed as of the date of this filing   inflation   inflation can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs a prolonged period of inflation could cause a general economic downturn and negatively impact our results however the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years   seasonality   we do not believe that our business will be seasonal to any material degree             results of operations for the three and nine month period ended march   and march     for the three months ended march   and march   we had revenues of  and  respectively and incurred a net loss of  and  respectively these losses were largely attributable to consulting fees and expenses related to being a public company   for the nine months ended march   and march   we had revenues of  and  respectively and incurred a net loss of  and  respectively these losses were largely attributable to consulting fees and expenses related to being a public company   inventory   as of march   we had approximately  worth of product and packaging in inventory compared to  worth of product in inventory as of june     operating expenses   operating expenses increased by  for the nine month period ended march   from  for the three month period ended march   the increase was primarily due to the increase in expenses related to investor relations and other expenses of being a public company   operating expenses decreased by  for the nine month period ended march   from  for the three month period ended march   the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in advertising expenses related to packaging design and production as well as decreased broker and consulting fees and a decrease in other operating expenses related to direct to consumer sales of our product   customers   for the three and nine month periods ending march   the majority of revenues resulted from wholesale sales of nightfood to distributors and retailers as well as direct to consumer sales   liquidity and capital resources   as of march   we had cash on hand of  and inventory value of             the company has limited available cash resources and we do not believe our cash on hand will be adequate to satisfy our ongoing working capital needs the company is continuing to raise capital through private placement of our common stock to finance the company’s operations of which it can give no assurance of success however we believe that our current capitalization structure combined with the continued expansion in distribution will enable us to achieve successful financings to continue our growth because the business is new and has limited operating history and relatively few sales no certainty of continuation can be stated management is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations in the next twelve months management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt and equity financing however the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue there are no assurances the company will receive the necessary funding or generate revenue necessary to fund operations   even if the company is successful in raising additional funds the company cannot give any assurance that it will in the future be able to achieve a level of profitability from the sale of its products to sustain its operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty   since our inception we have sustained operating losses during the nine months ended march   we incurred a net loss of  compared to  for the nine months ended march     during the nine months ended march   net cash used in operating activities was  compared to  for the nine months ended march     during the nine months ended march   net cash aggregating  was provided by financing activities   from our inception in january  through march   we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  compared to  from inception through june   assuming we raise additional funds and continue operations we expect to incur additional operating losses during the remainder of calendar  and possibly thereafter we plan to continue to pay or satisfy existing obligation and commitments and finance our operations as we have in the past primarily through the sale of our securities and other forms of external financing until such time that we are able to generate sufficient funds from the sale of our products to finance our operations of which we can give no assurance   on november   the company entered into a material definitive agreement on that date the company executed and delivered a plan of reorganization including option to acquire the “plan” by and among the registrant hook group llc “hook” and suffield foods llc “suffield” the plan contemplates the registrant acquiring an equity interest in and potentially

estimates   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate past judgments and our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful allowance for inventory writedowns and write offs deferred income taxes provision for contractual obligations and our ability to continue as a going concern we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   note  to the consolidated financial

procedures including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures accordingly even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives additionally in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures management is required to apply its reasonable judgment based on the evaluation described above our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report because we did not document our sarbanesoxley act section  internal controls and procedures   as funds become available to us we expect to implement additional measures to improve disclosure controls and procedures such as implementing and documenting our internal controls procedures   changes in internal controls over financial reporting   there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report which has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   limitations on the effectiveness of controls   a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the company’s management including its principal executive officer and its principal financial officer do not expect that the company’s disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected            part ii – other information   item  legal proceedings   we are not engaged in any litigation at the present time and

statements   these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six  months ended december   and  respectively reflect all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly the financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   these interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended june   and  respectively which are included in the company’s june   annual report on form k filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on september   the company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read or have access to the audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding period and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context the results of operations for the six  months ended december   are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending june             use of estimates ● the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles

 and  for the six months ended december   and  respectively           income taxes ● the company has not generated any taxable income and therefore no provision for income taxes has been provided             ● deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with fasb topic  accounting for income taxes which requires the use of the assetliability method of accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss and credit carryforwards

date of this filing   inflation   inflation can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs a prolonged period of inflation could cause a general economic downturn and negatively impact our results however the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years   seasonality   we do not believe that our business will be seasonal to any material degree             results of operations for the three and six month period ended december   and december     for the three months ended december   and december   we had revenues of  and  respectively and incurred a net loss of  and  respectively these losses were largely attributable to consulting fees and expenses related to being a public company   for the six months ended december   and december   we had revenues of  and  respectively and incurred a net loss of  and  respectively these losses were largely attributable to consulting fees and expenses related to being a public company   revenue   our net revenues for the three month period ended december   were  net of sales allowances and sales discounts compared to  for the three month period ended december     our net revenues for the six month period ended december   were  net of sales allowances and sales discounts compared to  for the six month period ended december     inventory   as of december   we had approximately  worth of product and packaging in inventory compared to  worth of product in inventory as of june     operating expenses   operating expenses decreased by  for the three month period ended december   from  for the three month period ended december   the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in paid advertising and other operating expenses related to direct to consumer sales of our product   operating expenses decreased by  for the six month period ended december   from  for the six month period ended december   the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in paid advertising and other operating expenses related to direct to consumer sales of our product   customers   for the three and six month period ending december   the majority of revenues resulted from wholesale sales of nightfood to distributors and retailers as well as direct to consumer sales   liquidity and capital resources   as of december   we had cash on hand of  and inventory value of             the company has limited available cash resources and we do not believe our cash on hand will be adequate to satisfy our ongoing working capital needs the company is continuing to raise capital through private placement of our common stock to finance the company’s operations of which it can give no assurance of success however we believe that our current capitalization structure combined with the continued expansion in distribution will enable us to achieve successful financings to continue our growth because the business is new and has limited operating history and relatively few sales no certainty of continuation can be stated management is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations in the next twelve months management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt and equity financing however the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue there are no assurances the company will receive the necessary funding or generate revenue necessary to fund operations   even if the company is successful in raising additional funds the company cannot give any assurance that it will in the future be able to achieve a level of profitability from the sale of its products to sustain its operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty   since our inception we have sustained operating losses during the six months ended december   we incurred a net loss of  compared to  for the six months ended december     during the six months ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  compared to  for the six months ended december     during the six months ended december   net cash aggregating  was provided by financing activities   from our inception in january  through december   we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  assuming we raise additional funds and continue operations we expect to incur additional operating losses during the remainder of fiscal  and possibly thereafter we plan to continue to pay or satisfy existing obligation and commitments and finance our operations as we have in the past primarily through the sale of our securities and other forms of external financing until such time that we are able to generate sufficient funds from the sale of our products to finance our operations of which we can give no assurance   on november   the company entered into a material definitive agreement on that date the company executed and delivered a plan of reorganization including option to acquire the “plan” by and among the registrant hook group llc “hook” and suffield foods llc “suffield” the plan contemplates the registrant acquiring an equity interest in and potentially merging hook and its subsidiary suffield with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant as of the date of this filing the agreement remains in effect and the parties continue to work towards a closing   critical accounting policies and estimates   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate past judgments and our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful allowance for inventory writedowns and write offs deferred income taxes provision for contractual obligations and our ability to continue as a going concern we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   note  to the consolidated financial statements presented in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements there were no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended december     off balance sheet arrangements   none            item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   no report required   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms disclosure and control procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures   we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december   in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures accordingly even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives additionally in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures management is required to apply its reasonable judgment based on the evaluation described above our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report because we did not document our sarbanesoxley act section  internal controls and procedures   as funds become available to us we expect to implement additional measures to improve disclosure controls and procedures such as implementing and documenting our internal controls procedures   changes in internal controls over financial reporting   there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report which has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   limitations on the effectiveness of controls   a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the company’s management including its principal executive officer and its principal financial officer do not expect that the company’s disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected            part ii – other information   item  legal proceedings   we are not engaged in any litigation at the present time and management is unaware of any claims or complaints that could result in future litigation management will seek to minimize disputes with its customers but
