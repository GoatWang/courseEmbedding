print the boston globe tweet share by steven syre globe columnist  october   hollywood has nothing on greater boston’s technology world when it comes to an obsession with youth from kendall square to the innovation district companies trip over each other every day to recruit new freshfaced tech talent that can help them go publicin that culture john and george hatsopoulos stick out like a couple of sore thumbs john the chief executive of tecogen inc is  years old which makes him george’s kid brother this chief executive is playing tennis — not extreme sports — during his spare time advertisement but the brothers who together own slightly more than half of tecogen are chasing the same dream that drives countless cambridge twentysomethings to work deep into the night — building a company around developing technology and taking it publictalk to john for five minutes and he’ll convince you of two things age and enthusiasm are not issues at tecogen get talking points in your inbox an afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news delivered weekdays sign up thank you for signing up sign up for more newsletters here “i’m  years old and i work more than  hours a week” john said a couple of days ago “this is the best time i’ve ever had in my life” john and george a tecogen director at  have more than a confident attitude the hatsopoulos brothers have the kind of track record most upandcoming technology executives can only dream about they’ve spent a half century creating businesses out of new technology and taking them publictheir first public company thermo electron inc of waltham was based on george’s research developing a device for the direct conversion of heat to electricity while attending mit in the s advertisement that business was a success in its own right but it also spun out another  public companies that worked on everything from medical equipment to bombdetecting devicesif john and george don’t sound particularly glitzy neither does the company they run today tecogen doesn’t create flashy apps to control heating and cooling systems it builds power systems that can generate electricity and run heating or cooling units for big buildings their niche customers looking for especially high efficiency and low emissionstecogen traces its roots to an old thermo electron unit that served as the company’s general research division in decades past the company operates in waltham — just a mile or so from what is today known as thermo fisher scientific inc — the epicenter for a technology boom of another generationthe hatsopoulos brothers bought the business from thermo more than a decade ago and brought many of its employees with themthat includes tecogen’s president robert panora who ran product development engineering and operations functions when the business was owned by thermo electrontoday tecogen is a growing but modestsized business it generates about  million in annual sales and employs about  people like many small technology companies it is losing money while it increases businessover the summer tecogen filed paperwork to raise  million in the stock market and aimed to launch its initial public offering last weekthe timing amid choppy markets and a government shutdown was not ideal john hatsopoulos says offers to buy tecogen shares were lower than expected so he withdrew the ipo“we’re not about to give our company away” he says “we’d be doing a lot of damage to our existing shareholders and employees who have stock options”tecogen’s shortterm solution for its cash needs is a direct line to the chief executive’s checkbookjohn hatsopoulos who is paid  a year as chief executive extended a  million letter of credit to the company in july according to tecogen ipo documentshe said the company would look for other private financing and hopefully try again to go public next yearskeptics might view tecogen’s public stock plans as a way out for older owners tired of funding a business from their own pocketsjohn hatsopoulos insists tecogen’s ipo plan was about raising money to expand and capitalize on technology advances the company has made in the last few years and the chief executive says he doesn’t have plans to go anywhere“as long as i’m healthy i have no intention of retiring” hatsopoulos says“maybe nature will change my mind but i have a goal of being around for  or  more active years”the hatsopoulos brothers have always had big ambitions maybe that’s what keeps them youngsteven syre is a globe columnist he can be reached at syreglobecom real journalists real

george n hatsopoulos grew up in nazioccupied greece he admired thomas edison and wanted to emulate him as both an inventor and entrepreneur as a teenager he built and sold radios and transmitters which were outlawed by the nazis after the war he came to the united states with a scholarship to study mechanical engineering at mit in  hatsopoulos finished his doctoral dissertation about his theoretical invention of an engine that converted heat directly into electricity without any moving parts called the “thermionic energy converter” that same year he and his brother john formed the thermo electron corporation to commercialize his invention they started the company in george’s living room and basement with  borrowed from a greek ship owner the energy converter never came to fruition but the effort spawned a successful engineering company which went on to become the largest analytical instrumentation company in the world the innovative company has been referred to as a “perpetual idea machine” from the beginning hatsopoulos saw the value in turning ideas into products and new businesses his strategy was to make each promising technology the core of its own new subsidiary to encourage entrepreneurial activity hatsopoulos retired as chairman of thermo electron in  and remained an active board member thermo electron corporation acquired fisher scientific in  and became thermo fisher scientific  the company now serves pharmaceutical and biotech companies hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs universities research institutions government agencies and

heinz award in technology the economy and employment for his development of the thermionic converter and his innovative methods of creating new technologybased enterprises as a teenager in nazioccupied greece dr hatsopoulos built and sold illegal radios and transmitters later as a young man he won a scholarship to mit to study mechanical engineering with the goal of becoming both an inventor and a businessman forty years later in an age focused on core competencies his company thermo electron corporation is a pacesetter eager to experiment with new technologies and build new subsidiaries around them dr hatsopoulos transformed a once small laboratory into a world leader in environmental monitoring biomedical manufacturing and many other specialized products and technologies the company employs over  people and has annual sales of  billion you cant be enamored with technology dr hatsopoulos has said you must instead be driven by the needs of the marketplace that pragmatic philosophy has been a useful guide to the founder and now chief executive officer of the waltham massachusettsbased thermo electron corporation dr hatsopoulos success began when he devised a theoretical engine that converted heat directly into electricity without using any moving parts his thermionic converter the first in an impressive string of technological innovations became the catalyst for the creation of a company that is today an international leader in manufacturing based on an everincreasing number of ideas and technologies coming from thermo electron the company is often referred to as a perpetual idea machine dr hatsopoulos sees those ideas not just as new products but also as seeds for new businesses he developed a strategy to make each new technology the core of its own new subsidiary armed with the flexibility and resources to explore further innovation thermo electron is now parent to  of these spinout companies all designed to motivate entrepreneurship thermo electron is careful to explain that it spins out not spins off its companies the company always retains a majority stake in each new endeavor and offers its new stock to the public and not to existing shareholders the corporate parent then continues to provide strategic planning employee benefits and pension fund management executive recruiting and other internal administration services thus freeing up the subsidiary to focus on innovation and market needs dr hatsopoulos formula for success is really very simple he seeks to anticipate societys problems develop the technology to solve them and have the product on line in time to meet the need but it is in his implementation of that formula that he stands apart as a business leader in creating a new corporate structure he has discovered a way to sustain growth in todays rapidly changing world markets note this profile is excerpted from the commemorative brochure published at the time of the awards presentation updates
