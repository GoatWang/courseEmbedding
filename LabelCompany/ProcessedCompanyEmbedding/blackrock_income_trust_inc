international investing involves special risks including but not limited to political risks currency fluctuations illiquidity and volatility these risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets fixed income risks include interestrate and credit risk typically when interest rates rise there is a corresponding decline in bond values credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments principal of mortgage or assetbacked securities normally may be prepaid at any time reducing the yield and market value of those securities obligations of us govt agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us govt noninvestmentgrade debt securities highyieldjunk bonds may be subject to greater market fluctuations risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations which adversely affect returns in addition many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less
