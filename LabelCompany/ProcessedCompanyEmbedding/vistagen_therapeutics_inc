depression is a global public health concern depression is a serious medical illness and a global public health concern that can occur at any time over a persons life while most people will experience depressed mood at some point during their lifetime major depressive disorder mdd is different mdd is the chronic pervasive feeling of utter unhappiness and suffering which impairs daily functioning symptoms of mdd include diminished pleasure in activities changes in appetite that result in weight changes insomnia or oversleeping psychomotor agitation loss of energy or increased fatigue feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt difficulty thinking concentrating or making decisions and thoughts of death or suicide and attempts at suicide suicide is estimated to be the cause of death in up to  individuals with severe mdd or bipolar disorder for many people depression cannot be controlled for any length of time without treatment standard medications available in the multibilliondollar global antidepressant market include commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris and serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors snris and atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole the issues with standard antidepressants ssris and snris about two out of every three drugtreated patients suffering from depression do not receive adequate therapeutic benefit from their initial treatment with a standard fdaapproved antidepressant and the likelihood of achieving remission declines with each successive treatment attempt we are developing av a new generation oral cns prodrug candidate in phase  clinical development initially as adjunctive treatment replacing the widespread use of atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole for tens of millions of mdd patients worldwide suffering from an inadequate response to standard antidepressants paradigmshifting clinical studies performed by dr carlos zarate and others at the national institute of mental health nimh yale university and several other academic research centers have demonstrated that when given intravenously a single low dose of ketamine can produce robust and rapid antidepressant effects in mdd patients av is functionally similar to ketamine in that both are nmda receptor antagonists however av modulates nmda receptor channel activity and ketamine blocks it we believe that this difference in receptor activity can potentially bypass the adverse side effects that occur with ketamine where av might fit as an adjunctive therapy in the depression treatment algorithm learn more about av email
