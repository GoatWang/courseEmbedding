onglyza® saxagliptin and kombiglyze™ xr saxaglibtin and metformin us reissue patent no re “the ’ patent” nature of the case and issues presented astrazeneca marketed a tablet formulation of saxagliptin under the trade name onglyza® to improve glycemic control in adults with type  diabetes astrazeneca also marketed a combination of saxagliptin and metformin under the trade name kombiglyzetm xr for the same purpose defendants filed andas seeking to manufacture and market generic versions of astrazeneca’s products arguing that the ’ patent was invalid as obvious in light of the prior art astrazeneca brought suit alleging that defendants’ generic formulations infringed the ’ patent and defendants countered by challenging the patent’s validity after a bench trial the court found in favor of astrazeneca concluding that defendants failed to meet their burden of proving invalidity why astrazeneca prevailed the prior art did not support defendants’ arguments that one of ordinary skill would have developed a saxagliptin formulation based on vildagliptin to treat type  diabetes indeed at the time of patenting there were a number of chemical bases that could have been used to fill the role of vildagliptin and one of ordinary skill would only conclude that vildagliptin was obvious by relying on impermissible hindsight bias what’s more there was no evidence that one of ordinary skill would modify vildagliptin to create saxagliptin indeed the prior art taught away from such a modification suggesting that it would reduce the stability of the chemical compound further there was no evidence that one of ordinary skill would be motivated to make a second modification to the chemical compound adding a cyclopropyl group to the compound without this modification the compound would be ineffective in treating type  diabetes for these reasons the court concluded that defendants had failed to provide sufficient evidence to invalidate the claims the court did however deny astrazeneca’s request for fees though the court upheld the validity of astrazeneca’s patent it did so only after analyzing the credibility of expert witnesses thus the court reasoned the case did not hinge on a substantively weak litigation position and an award of fees was inappropriate send print report related posts astrazeneca ab v apotex corp astrazeneca lp v breath ltd

autoimmunity infection and vaccines neuroscience with more than  employees and  billion in revenue in  the cambridgebased company continues to rank among the largest drug companies in the world formed by the merger of two companies astra ab and zeneca group plc in  the company had early success with drugs like the painnumbing agent lidocaine in  the company had a big win when the us food and drug administration fda approved its new bladder cancer drug imfinzi durvalumab according to analysts the drug could make  billion but astrazeneca also had its share of legal trouble paying more than  billion in federal fines and legal settlements for corrupting clinical trials and illegally promoting antipsychotics it also faces several lawsuits filed by patients who say the drugmaker’s products injured them history of astrazeneca astra ab was founded in  in sodertalje sweden as an attempt to help sweden compete with german and swiss medicine but the company was unable to achieve ambitious goals when world war i began a dyestuffs company called asf bought astra in  to compete in the chemical industry but the company struggled to turn a profit for the next decade astra finally became profitable in  eventually increasing sales fold by  the company took its first step into independent research in the s by developing drugs like hepaforte — a treatment for a disease that prevents the body from absorbing enough vitamin b the company purchased rivals tika pharmaceuticals and paul g nordstrom’s factories in  to become the dominant drug company in sweden in  astra developed the blockbuster numbing agent xylocaine lidocaine giving it a worldwide presence for the first time the us food and drug administration approved it three years later and the us became its largest market the success of the drug allowed astra to invest more money into research astrazenecas rd site in mölndal swedenexpansion of astra the company expanded worldwide forming subsidiaries in europe the us south america and australia by the s astra began focusing solely on pharmaceuticals selling off all of its other assets by the s when it launched treatments for ulcers in  astra became one of the fastestgrowing companies in the world during the s astra more than doubled its number of employees knowing its patents for ulcer drugs would expire in the early s it invested millions of dollars into research and developed six drugs that launched in  merge with zeneca group plc though its roots trace back to the s zeneca was a relatively young company when it merged with astra in  zeneca was a product of a  demerger of imperial chemical industries ici headquartered in london zeneca bought astra for  billion in december  forming the new company astrazeneca ici began making pharmaceuticals in the s and s but separated its businesses in  zeneca formed from the demerger and rode on the successes of drugs developed during its time with ici with patents due to expire in the early s and few products in development zeneca saw a merger with astra as a wise strategic move in december  zeneca bought astra for  billion the new company astrazeneca was the fourthlargest in the world with a value of  billion when the merger completed in  each company brought blockbuster drugs with it astra brought prilosec a drug to treat acid reflux and heartburn and zeneca brought nolvadex tamoxifen to treat breast cancer seroquel scandals early on the company had a history of playing it safe in the s astra saw the future of antidepressants it developed the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri called zimelidine and began selling it  but the drug produced a rare side effect that could damage the nervous system and the company recalled it a year later by recalling zimelidine it avoided potential catastrophic losses from possible lawsuits but it had already received harsh criticism for its involvement in scandals for its blockbuster antipsychotics seroquel and seroquel xr critics say the company was more focused on maximizing profits while it still had the patent on the drug than on patient and trial participant safety in addition to paying  million to resolve more than  lawsuits that allege seroquel can cause diabetes the company paid to settle illegal marketing charges it also faced a number of scandals including corrupt data in studies for marketing the drug to children a sex scandal and a poorly run clinical trial that could may have compromised patient safety and data reliability marketing seroquel for children dr melissa delbello was the lead author of a groundbreaking  study that found astrazeneca’s atypical antipsychotic seroquel quetiapine was safe for use in children astrazeneca financed the study which included  children diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the end only eight children taking seroquel completed the trial and delbello determined the study was inconclusive however the study was published anyway and concluded seroquel was more effective in children than a test group not receiving the drug the publication led to a national recommendation that atypical antipsychotics be the leading choice for children with bipolar disorder fact astrazeneca covered up study results that revealed seroquel was either inconclusive or harmful other studies involving seroquel produced inconclusive or harmful results those were never published it was later revealed that astrazeneca systematically covered up the results a company email used as evidence in a court case revealed “thus far we have buried trials    the larger issue is how do we face the outside world when they begin to criticize us for suppressing data” in  us sen charles grassley criticized delbello for receiving at least  in paid consulting fees and travel costs from astrazeneca after years of investigations astrazeneca paid a  million fine brought by the us department of justice for promoting seroquel for unapproved uses the company also paid  million to settle global lawsuits for failing to warn the public of seroquel’s side effects ‘sexforstudies’ seroquel scandal in  a florida lawsuit claimed then us medical director for seroquel dr wayne macfadden had sexual relationships with a clinical researcher who wrote journal articles favorable to seroquel and a medical marketer who promoted seroquel the case was one of  claiming people developed diabetes and gained weight while on the drug plaintiffs said these relationships were improper because research was supposed to be independent of astrazeneca macfadden also had sexual relationships with employees of competitors and asked for trade secrets cbs news and medpage today reported “the mere existence of these relationships calls into question the integrity of the scientific work product of those involved” according to documents written by plaintiffs’ attorneys in  emails also surfaced showing astrazeneca’s publications manager john tumas buried three clinical trials with unfavorable seroquel clinical data poorly organized clinical trial in  a seroquel xr trial for borderline personality disorder headed by dr s charles schultz faced scrutiny because of poor oversight the new york times reported astrazeneca paid schultz the head of the department of psychiatry at the university of minnesota to conduct the trial in addition he received more than  for “speaking and consulting fees and other payments” from  to  because of lack of supervision two participants at a facility for sex offenders were able to fake their way into the trial one of these men slipped seroquel xr to unsuspecting staff and residents the men were removed from the trial but no one followed up with an investigation following the seroquel xr trial debacle schultz stepped down as head of psychiatry at the university despite the sloppy trial and about one third of the participants dropping out because of side effects results published in the american journal of psychiatry showed the drug as a promising treatment for borderline personality disorder astrazeneca didn’t pursue formal approval from the fda however prior to this trial the university of minnesota ran a seroquel trial in  and one participant dan markingson committed suicide while on the drug astrazeneca’s drug side effect litigation in addition to astrazeneca’s antipsychotic controversy it also faced growing legal problems from some of its blockbuster medications people who took some of the company’s bestselling drugs say the drugmaker failed to warn of side effects crestor learn about crestor the cholesterol drug crestor rosuvastatin is used to prevent or treat heart disease heart attacks and strokes people harmed by crestor took astrazeneca to court claiming in lawsuits the drug contained dangerous defects a consumer advocacy group also called for the recall of crestor from the us market but no recall was ordered onglyza  kombiglyze xr learn about onglyza the fda approved onglyza saxagliptin in  to treat type  diabetes astrazeneca and partner bristolmyers squibb made hundreds of millions of dollars annually from onglyza but a study reported onglyza increased the risk of hospitalizations due to heart

pharmaceutical industry — nicknamed big pharma — is one of the most powerful industries in the world the global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over  trillion in  but nowhere else in the world do the

devices are also lucrative the us makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about  billion according to the us department of commerce us based big pharma companies meanwhile drug prices continue to rise consulting firm segal consulting expects drug prices for americans under age  to rise  percent in  in contrast wages are only expected to rise  percent leaving many american unable to afford their medications big pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the us food and drug administration fda through application fees user fees for its new products experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the fda’s budget five of the top  pharma and medical device companies for  are headquartered in the us johnson  johnson pfizer merck gilead and abbvie the underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud bribery product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail” despite criminal charges and fines the companies continue to do business who is big pharma the majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits the biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices the most powerful drug and device companies are members of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma — the industry’s us lobbying organization with the help of staggering profits and an army of  paid lobbyists the industry spreads its influence on capitol hill from  to  big pharma

percent of americans have a good opinion of big pharma only  percent of americans have a good opinion of big pharma in fact they are the second most hated industry in the us they are also the biggest defrauder of the federal government under the false claims act according to consumer watchdog group public citizen the reputation institute evaluated public perception of  pharmaceutical companies for

knee implants hospital beds boston scientific marlborough massachusetts ivc filters surgical mesh big pharma’s influence critics contend that big pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers the fda and the public to increase sales the public is exposed to pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising for example critics say abbvie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as androgel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men they created a marketing campaign around the condition “low t” that featured a quiz for men to selfdiagnose low t symptoms androgel above was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up the testosterone market soared into the billions as a result but few studies back up drugcompany claims that the drug significantly enhances mood vitality and sexual performance studies also link these drugs to heart problems the fda added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to big pharma doctors conduct research with funds from big pharma private charities and foundations account for a mere  percent of the estimated  billion spent on biomedical research in the us each year pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately  percent big pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout the trade group phrma has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena including  who worked for a member of congress  who worked for a federal agency  who worked for a congressional committee two who worked for the white house one who worked in the court system using these connections to pursue industry goals big pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest marketing research and development rd and drug cost americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases thousands of dollars more per prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed journal of the american medical association jama actively vie for the attention of big pharma advertising dollars billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug according to propublica’s dollars for docs investigation  companies paid  billion to doctors and hospitals from august  to december  drug and device company payments to doctors from select companies august  to december  company payments depuy johnson  johnson  million stryker corporation  million astrazeneca  million pfizer  million janssen pharmaceuticals  million glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesbig pharma fraud settlements in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud according to public citizen’s  report pharmaceutical industry settlements  through  fact in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud the most common charge involved drugpricing scams against state medicaid programs this meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while big pharma made billions unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements but these investigations take many years to complete by then drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion while the us department of justice fine is typically only a few million this makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies according to michael bobelian of forbes magazine manufacturer directory several of the biggest drug and medical device companies sell the majority of their products in the us many of these products are involved in product liability litigation some of the companies’ bestselling drugs brought in over a billion in

submitting your applications and supporting documentation to the patient assistance programs on your behalf tracking your enrollment with the assistance programs and managing the timetable for your

both although with generics your price may vary depending on the prescription q where do these drugs come from a the medications are supplied directly from the drug manufacturer and normally at least a  day supply is given q why would the pharmaceutical companies offer these programs a there is differing of opinions on the exact reasons that pharmaceutical companies are giving away so many free prescription medications some say that they do it because of their ongoing commitment to public health and because they really do care about lowincome families others noting the excruciating guidelines to participate and that the programs are typically not advertised argue it is more of a political move on the part of these companies regardless of why the fact is that they do give away free prescription medications and many people can benefit and now with the help of scbn the processes have been made easy for the average patient q how long does it take to get my medication a from the time you enroll until your medications are in your hands takes on average  weeks renewal applications must be sent in early to allow for this your personal care advocate will contact you when it is time to get started on the renewal process q what should i do after applying a continue with your medication as normal until the first shipment arrives from the pharmaceutical company scbn never dispenses medication or approves an application we cannot guarantee the time of shipment of your order q how much medication will i be receiving a most companies have a  year enrollment period and send out a threemonth supply of medication at a time q why do some medications go to my home but others go to the doctors office a excellent questionin order to send medication directly to a patient the drug company must be appropriately licensed with the federal government because many drug manufacturers are not properly licensed to dispense medication in this way they must send the medications to a doctors office that can legally dispense them to you q how to dispose of unused medicines  a fda and the white house office of national drug control policy developed federal guidelines that are summarized here follow any specific disposal instructions on the prescription drug labeling or patient information that accompanies the medicine do not flush medicines down the sink or toilet unless this information specifically instructs you to do so take advantage of community drug takeback programs that allow the public to bring unused drugs to a central location for proper disposal call your city or county governments household trash and recycling service see blue pages in phone book to see if a takeback program is available in your community the us drug enforcement administration working with state and local law enforcement agencies periodically sponsors national prescription drug takeback days if no disposal instructions are given on the prescription drug labeling and no takeback program is available in your area throw the drugs in the household trash following these steps  remove them from their original containers and mix them with an undesirable substance such as used coffee grounds or kitty litter this makes the drug less appealing to children and pets and unrecognizable to people who may intentionally go through the trash seeking drugs  place the mixture in a sealable bag empty can or other container to prevent the drug from leaking or breaking out of a garbage bag before throwing out a medicine container scratch out all identifying information on the prescription label to make it unreadable this will help protect your identity and the privacy of your personal health information do not give your medicine to friends doctors prescribe medicines based on a persons specific symptoms and medical history a medicine that works for you could be dangerous for someone else when in doubt about proper disposal talk to your pharmacist read more about proper

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples

may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
