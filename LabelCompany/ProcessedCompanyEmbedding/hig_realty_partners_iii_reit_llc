reit cove partners issues open letter to shareholders of american realty capital new york city reit urges shareholders to vote against the entrenchmentserving proposals to amend the companys charter at upcoming annual meetingbelieves the proposals eliminate valuable shareholder protections and open the door for unfettered control by the companys schorschcontrolled external advisor news provided by cove partners iii llc jun    et share this article new york june   prnewswire  cove partners iii llc a shareholder of american realty capital new york city reit inc nyc reit or the company announced today that it has issued an open letter to its fellow nyc reit shareholders urging them to once again vote against the shareholderunfriendly proposals to amend the companys charter at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held on june   the full text of the letter follows below june   to our fellow shareholders vote no at the upcoming annual meeting like you we are shareholders of american realty capital new york city reit inc nyc reit try as we might we were unable to acquire our  shares before the record date for the june   annual meeting of shareholders the annual meeting so we will be unable to vote our shares at the upcoming annual meeting we knew this at the time we acquired our shares we also knew at the time that the shares had fallen at least  in value from their date of sale to you notwithstanding during the same period one of the greatest surges in the value of new york city real estate we also knew at the time that the quarterly distributions to shareholders which you had been receiving were not dividends from profits or earnings which management has finally admitted  rather they consisted of your own capital investment and proceeds from borrowings being paid back to you  we were aware of even more nyc reit is managed by an external advisor controlled by nick schorsch whose controlled advisory companies have recently had serious issues  for example vereit inc is a multibillion dollar net lease formed and advised by mr schorschs affiliates is under investigation for manipulation of earnings that occurred under his advisory watch with a criminal trial scheduled for this june separately in  massachusetts regulatory authorities found that his affiliates had manipulated shareholder voting procedures one of mr schorschs brokerage affiliates filed for bankruptcy in  since he has withdrawn from raising new money mr schorsch has been on a tear to convert his oneyear management contracts into long term  year contracts locking in the fee income for himself and diminishing the value of the shares so why did we purchase nyc reit shares  because we would consider an increased investment in the company  but before doing so we believe that shareholders must once again reject the basket of outrageous selfserving and entrenchmentminded proposals to amend the companys charter that are up for consideration at the annual meeting which were recommended and approved by the handpicked schorsch board of directors the board these value destroying proposals the most egregious of which are described below eliminate valuable shareholder protections and open up the door for unlimited and unfettered schorsch control of your investment these shareholderunfriendly proposals include a proposal to end the stated fiduciary obligation of the board to shareholders including the specific fiduciary duty to supervise the relationship with the companys advisor  a proposal to allow the board to extend the agreement with the schorschcontrolled advisor for an indefinite period of time rather than limiting it to oneyear renewals a proposal to limit your access to the books and records of the company a proposal to allow the board to interpret the companys charter rather than the state mandated blue sky guidelines which were designed for your protection a proposal which would prevent the schorsch advisory agreement from being terminated on  days written notice a proposal which would allow the board to privately sell shares in your company which could chill goodfaith purchase offers for nyc reit a proposal to eliminate the ability of  of the shareholders to call a special meeting giving the board unfettered authority to increase this threshold by x a proposal to eliminate the current shareholder majority voting requirement before the board can take specified actions a proposal to eliminate the current independent director requirement as presently stated a proposal to eliminate from the relevant experience requirement that independent directors have prior real estate experience a proposal which would allow the board to pursue nonreal estate investments a proposal to no longer require liquidation of the company if your shares are not publicly registered for trading within six years if you care about the value of your investment want to see an active fair market for your shares and importantly retain the ability to select and hold the board and your management team accountable then you must vote against all of these selfserving proposals at the upcoming annual meeting  we urge you to discuss these crucial issues that threaten your rights and seek to undermine the shareholder franchise with your financial advisors today  for the record we would be happy to openly debate our position with members of the board of nyc reit sincerely michael ashner  john albacove partners iii llc about cove partners iii llccove partners iii llc is a private company which
