are interested in talking with you call us for a free noobligation consultationq if i have only a few acres will i get the same type treatment as a large mineral ownera regardless of the size of your net mineral acreage or royalty income position we treat every clientwith the same importance and respect oklahoma oil and gas mineral rights buyer prides themselves on their professional approach in serving their many clientsq how long of a wait should i expect before seeing any profitsa if you prefer a quick turnaround it is best to sell your oil gas and mineral rights for their current per acre value this is fastest way to receive a profit for your mineral ownership leasing your mineral rights is another way to profit for your mineral ownership but that return is subject to future exploration and production volumesq why cant i represent my own oil gas and mineral rights interestsa maximizing your mineral rights profits requires an advanced knowledge of the oil gas and gas liquids industry this includes being knowledgeable with each aspect of preproduction production transportation and sales being unfamiliar with these issues will grossly affect the ability to maximize your available mineral rights profits as far as selfproduction keep in mind that oil and gas companies pay a proportionate share of the cost of every well this usually equates to hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars you may be in a position to dothe very same thing but for the vast majority of mineral rights owners that type of investment is out of the question the best choice is having oklahoma oil and gas mineral rights buyer act as your expert our involvement will help insure that you receive the highest profits from your mineral rightspurchasing your rights is worth more to us this is because my call us today and find out what we could pay now for your rightsq is there any tax benefits to selling your oil gas and mineral rights versus collecting royalty incomea one of the things we hear more than any other is weighing the taxation pros and cons regarding selling minerals verses waiting on the royalty income selling these rights is considered a sale of real property and is taxed at capital gains rates an example of how this works is found in for  capital gains taxes these taxes have a  cap and if you happen to be in the bottom  brackets you will not pay any taxes given the current tax law the capital gains cap is set to increase in  as much as  regardless of whether you are in the lowestincome tax brackets the capital gains tax will be raised up to  any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates which in many cases can more than double your tax liability consequently there are real significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty incomeq will my bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling to become a consistent source of incomea the answer to that question depends solely on the following five points  if you can lease your interest and lease it every  years so you could collect a new signing bonus each time  if a well is drilled  if that well is not a dry hole  if that well is operated in a prudent manner  and most importantly if oil natural gas and gas liquids pricing sustains both continued production and the risk of new exploration please remember that no one person or company has control over these variablesq what about poolinga pooling issues are best answered on an individual basis call us at this number for additional answers to this issue  q dont i need legal counsel before making such a decisiona legal counsel is generally indispensable however attorneys tend to drag their feet thereby causing their clients to miss valuable time sensitive opportunities we have seen this happen more times than not usually after waiting several weeks or months we finally receive a phone call asking if the opportunity in question is still available sadly  of the time too much time has elapsed and the monies available back then are no longer appropriated in this type case the attorney profits not the mineral owner however leasing directly with oklahoma oil and gas mineral rights buyer allows for the negotiation of terms that might otherwise not be possibleq what makes your company any better than the others doing the same thinga first and foremost because of our many years of experience how this helps you is that we know what it takes to achieve the best possible profits for your mineral rights we know about the many factors associated with mineral leasing and royalty payments this knowledge doesnt come through guesswork but through our many years of handson experience let us show why
