is the answer for any level of clutter may   susanp michigan age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  as a recovering clutterer i have tried many fixes and fads to cure me of it some work for a season but never stick i never found a working solution until this book i know that sounds like an infomercial i was very skeptical and went into reading it with the knowledge it might be another quick fix and not a solution these two women know what they are talking about they tried and proved that this method works after only a few pages of them explaining fully even for those who need it spelled out i was off and running to do what they said it is a wonderful idea that totally makes sense you are still in charge not others if you are a clutter person you know exactly what i mean by that being a good thing i did not have the availability of doing this in a week with helpers for my review because of that i myself did what they recommended the helpers doing and it works i have emptied half this house already in the space of two weeks  not joking i love how they have it all organized and separated into thoughtful concise steps finally someone has hit the nail on the head as to how to satisfy the clutterer while helping them declutter i was given this book by the book club network for an honest review was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as

surely they havent seen my house  my family and i have been in this current house for almost  years and we still havent unpacked all the boxes yet  however that could be viewed as a blessing in disguise less things to organize and put awaytheyre already in boxes this book is divided into  sections section onegetting it under control and section twokeep the good life going the authors introduce the mount rushmore method and employ the box system the rush refers to the speedy  days of clearing up the clutter and the more refers to a team more than  person they also suggest setting a specific tangible goal and a deadline another important factor is having a game plan which includes deciding in advance where to store boxes labeling boxes and using the body as a guide for each days decluttering tasks by focusing on different partslevels of the home from the ground up this is an interesting concept that helps break down that overwhelming dread of decluttering into a bitesized doable mission the key is teamwork many hands make light work youre to invite people to come help you organize for  days and then celebrate the result with a party on the th day i think the idea is great but i dont think it will work well for everyone some people such as perfectionists and introverts would have a hard time with this approach  or those who really value their privacy the book does mention that the plan can be accomplished even by someone working alone but it just takes longer there are many useful practical ideas  tips in this book such as  steps to an organized life steps to
