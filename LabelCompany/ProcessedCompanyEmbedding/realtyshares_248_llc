write a review category business review topic crowdfunding investing real estate website wwwrealtysharescom about realtyshares founded by nav athwal realtyshares is a crowdfunding website for real estate developments that claims to help you diversify your portfolio and invest in prescreened and professionally managed residential commercial retail and mixeduse projects not only does realtyshares claim to help you purchase shares in private real estate investments but the company also claims to help companies access a new source of funding to raise capital for their investments how does realtyshares claim to work by now you’re almost certainly familiar with crowdfunding sites like kickstarter indiegogo gofundme and boostercom which help people raise money for their business ventures and personal needs using these websites all you have to do is list your project and if other people are interested in helping you out they can contribute as much money as they’re comfortable with recently though a new era of crowdfunding has entered the market with websites like realtyshares which claims to serve two primary purposes  to help accredited investors invest in a variety of real estate projects and  help companies fund their real estate projects without having to go through traditional banks or other large lenders since coming online in late  realtyshares has garnered quite a lot of media attention having been featured on the wall street journal forbes cnn money business times and more due in no small part to their claimed focus on helping individuals invest in real estate projects from their living rooms and giving them everything they need to invest intelligently in short realtyshares acts as a centralized area where companies who need funds for their private real estate projects can meet with investors who are willing to purchase shares in these projects and according to the company they give you the ability to make real estate investments in  simple steps sign up for a realtyshares account browse investments securely if you find one you’re interested in you’ll then be able to access a detailed page explaining the offering including “financials property information legal and financial documents and investment manager bios” finalize your investment directly through the realtyshares website the company even claims all documents can be signed electronically using docusign and funds can be transferred via balanced next each investment comes with a specific funding goal that must be met before you officially own a share while you’re waiting for this to occur your money will be held in an fdic insured escrow account and if this goal isn’t reached then  of your money will be refunded all realtyshares members have access to a personalized dashboard where you can monitor your investments and returns and manage your documents you’ll also receive quarterly updates about the project via email and tax documents are provided once per year you’ve worked diligently over the years to make smart investment decisions and this new breed of real estate crowdfunding websites has piqued your interest but you’re wondering if they’re ultimately worth your time or are just a passing fad after all you invest carefully and aren’t in the habit of losing your hardearned money but is realtyshares a company that you can count on to help you make wise investment decisions consider the following you have options when it comes to real estate investing first and foremost if you’re thinking about using a real estate crowdfunding website keep in mind that realtyshares isn’t your only option as other sites such as fundrise realty mogul crowdstreet collaperty and many more are vying for your business with this said according to realtyshares’ ceo the company differentiates itself from other real estate crowdfunding websites by offering lower fees complete transparency a seamless investment process and access to a wider range of investment opportunities how much risk are you willing to take on next like any other type of investment real estate projects come with a certain level of risk so you’re not guaranteed to make any money in fact in a worstcase scenario you could end up losing your entire investment also remember that real estate investments are not liquid which means that your money might be tied up for long periods of time as such you’ll need to thoroughly vet any investment you’re thinking about becoming involved with it realtyshares’ investor guidelines if you’re thinking about investing in a real estate project featured on realtyshares the most important thing you need to know is that you must be qualified as an accredited investor according to the realtyshares faq this means you must be “a natural person with  a net worth or joint net worth with the person’s spouse exceeding  million not including the value of the primary residence and  or  annual income of  in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding  for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income in the current year” on top of this you must have a minimum of  to contribute to a project although some investments may go as low as  there is no maximum investment amount and you can even qualify as a foreign investor realtyshares’ investment options if you qualify as an investor you’ll have two options debt investment and equity investment debt investment means that your contribution funds a loan for the company who’s responsible for the project and depending on your level of investment your portion of the money earned from monthly interest charges will be deposited into your account on the other hand an equity investment pays a percentage of cash flow from rent on a monthly basis or on the profits if the project is sold regardless of the type each investment will come with its own ‘hold period” which references the expected amount of time that will pass before investors recoup their money after a project has been paid off or sold this information will be available on the project’s investment overview page and can last anywhere from less than  months to more than  years realtyshares’ company guidelines according to the company’s website realtyshares only provides loans eg debt investments for  unit residential properties and some commercial properties such as apartment buildings specifically the website’s faq states projects must be cashflowingvalueadd equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments retail office and pools of single family homes equity investments in fix  flips located in high demandlow supply markets loans secured by residential and commercial real estate on top of this borrowers must have a minimum  credit score a loan to purchase price of less than  and an “estimated loan to after repair value once the property is rehabbed less than ” as such the realtyshares will not work for construction or groundup development projects on top of this realtyshares claims to closely screen all new projects prior to being listed including background and credit checks comps projected returns geography property type and quality investment structure a knowledgeable team and a proven track record although realtyshares doesn’t guarantee successful funding the company claims that most projects listed are funded within  days however for any projects listed on realtyshares companies will not be able to advertise them elsewhere in order to remain in compliance with regulation d rule b finally realtyshares’ funding methods are claimed to help you focus on operating the investment instead of communicating with numerous investors since all funds are pooled into a single llc the difference between realtyshares  reits when compared to reits real estate investment trusts realtyshares claims to give investors the ability to choose the specific type of property or groups of properties they’d like to invest in whereas reits traditionally only allow you to invest in specific asset classes or projects based on geography in addition realtyshares claims to charge substantially lower fees than reits we’ll talk more about this in a moment what are other investors saying about realtyshares realtyshares inc has only been in business since late  and there were no individual reviews available online at the time of our research however most professional reviews from large websites such as forbes and techcrunch seem to be favorable not just for realtyshares but for the growth of the real estate crowdfunding industry in general realtyshares pricing realtyshares is free to sign up for an account whether you’re an individual looking to invest or a company looking for funding however according to the company’s faq they “will charge a fee to cover ongoing investor reporting and communications for the investment” although the specific fee for each investment can vary and will be outlined in the project’s operating agreement after a project has been funded the money is pooled and moved into an individual llc which is the entity that will actually provide the loan or hold equity in the investment as such you will be a shareholder in this llc compared to many other real estate crowdfunding websites realtyshares accepts bitcoin for investments either through coinbase or your bitcoin address although distributions will be paid in us dollars in order to ask questions about fees payments or anything else you can contact realtyshares’ customer service department at  can realtyshares help you wisely diversify your investment portfolio chopping to the point considering the fact that realtyshares has received a fair amount of positive media attention that the real estate crowdfunding industry is in a growth phase and that there aren’t any negative online reviews for the company they appear to be a solid choice for purchasing shares in real estate

sponsored  blairwood dr   chalon rd investment and paragon who sponsored  gilbert road have stopped making payments they have given lame excuses for delays they are running a ponzi scheme to dupe investors and realtyshares did not do any due diligence before offering this deal and luring investors dont get caught in this poor dealings bottom line no i would not recommend this to a friend help others find the most helpful reviews was this review helpful yes no comments  view all  commentshide comments may   ted triwest certainly has been a disaster fortunately they managed to sell the property i had investments in and made some money but nothing like their claimed return even though the property sold for more than the original financial estimate i agree that realtyshares does minimal due diligence what is shocking is you cant get access to the agreement with the sponsor only the realtyshares llc you are investing in so the real terms and conditions arent available they are also easy to dupe they did an investment that claimed it would put no debt on the property and the sponsor secretly went to another website and got another big loan on the property while claiming it was unencumbered realtyshares has been almost completely unresponsive to emails about issues but they certainly keep sending out emails about new opportunities a strong buyer beware not only does realityshares do little to no due diligence but they make it impossible for you to do so either go ahead and ask if the sponsor has other projects at realityshares and they wont answer i went back to making my own hard money loans so i have access to the property the borrower and can track things closely do you have an account log in before commenting if you don’t have an account – don’t worry you

approach with caution since most people dont have much experience with this specific concept my experience has been very positive realtyshares has been very professional and responsible any real estate project has risks by default but i have had no issues after making more than  investments using the realtyshares platform realtyshares does a great job screening prospective deal sponsors because of that projects that might include underfunded developers crackpots slackers or sponsors who are challenged with planning and organization get screened out before any deal is offered on the platform the returnrisk equation has seemed promising to me on the vast majority of the deals offered i would  and have  recommended realtyshares to good friends bottom line yes i would recommend this

investment posted by financial samurai  comments i’ve got an idea that could be great for an ongoing series given financial samurai is an established site with a large community of investment savvy readers from all over the us and the world why not crowdsource our knowledge to see if we can make better investment decisions real estate is my favorite asset class to build wealth long term because it is simple to understand tangible and rides the inflation wave but buying physical real estate requires a large downpayment ongoing property taxes maintenance tenant headaches and often takes up a dangerously large percentage of one’s overall net worth given i already have four physical properties i’d like to diversify and reduce risk by surgically investing smaller amounts of capital in properties with higher rental yields from different parts of the country san francisco cap rates net rental yields for example are only in the  –  range this is where real estate crowdsourcing platforms come in you can easily invest smaller amounts in different areas of the country with potentially much higher returns without betting the farm by q i will have a relatively large  cd in the amount of  coming due before then i want to get comfortable with real estate crowdsource investing my goals are  geographic diversification  beating a  yield in a low risk way and  investing in

able to sell as planned in five years etc i generally like to cut target irrs in half and treat anything higher as gravy people tend to overpromise underdeliver all the time when it comes to raising capital  was targeting midwest and southern properties but conshohocken seems similarly cheap  haverford properties has only been investing since  although the linkedin bio of the cofounder charles

directly from seller at a potentially attractive basis of  per square foot the property was identified by the sponsor on an offmarket basis and is to relieve the seller of a negative cash flow situation caused by the recent vacancy of a tenant the expected new loan facility is to provide for months of interestonly payments no amortization which is designed to reduce the initial debt service

of william  mary and uc berkeley but at least both have graduate degrees and a decent amount of real estate investing experience william  mary and cal are my alma maters so i’m just having a little fun  investment deal  use of proceeds  nice to see  in reserves and  in working capital it’s interesting to see that despite a purchase price of   more is set aside  for various reasons  sources of funding for the office building  it’s always good to see a sponsor have skin in the game however  is only  of the total sources of funding despite being  of the equity from a realtyshares investor’s point of view you want the sponsor to put up even more capital my preference is for  of the capital or greater blue sky exit assumption  i still can’t believe it will cost a  commission in five years to sell a property  that seems outrageous given many of these deals are directly negotiated hopefully there is  upside in terms of commission savings here if you invested  in this deal  if the deal pans out an impressive  of your initial investment will be paid out in quarterly interest payments for the life of the deal the chart also states that if you invest  you will end up with profits of  over a five year period  total proceeds after initial capital is returned that’s a  total return if all works out or  annual return but again things tend to never work out as planned which is why i cut my return assumptions in half to be more conservative invest or pass i’m itching to invest in my first realtyshares deal and this commercial property in the suburbs of philly could be it but before i do i’d love to get your feedback especially if you are a real estate crowdsourcing veteran or live in the pa area every potential investment always looks good when you read the marketing material but as we all know not every investment turns out great hence the desire to crowdsource knowledge there are a lot of deals on realtyshares that already say “join the waitlist” further as i’m focusing on commercial real estate instead of single or multifamily home properties supply is even scarcer please feel free to be very critical of this potential investment it’s always good to know all the potential red flags before deploying any capital if there are any other investments on the platform that look intriguing let us know update  the deal closed and i decided to invest  to see how things go and familiarize myself with the realtyshares platform until end of q when i’ll have a lot more money to put to work comments daryl says august   at  am i’d wait for another opportunity conshohocken is in a somewhat awkward location and there is a lot of development going on in the king of prussia area about  miles away especially commercial property landlord might need to offer additional incentives to fill vacancies and it isn’t clear how much of any impact that would have to any anticipated investor returns reply financial samurai says august   at  am interesting about the king of prussia area are you saying that there is potentially oversupply of commercial real estate  miles seems a little far away to be a direct comp no reply daryl says august   at  pm many of the potential tenants and their employer will be coming from the west by car they will drive by king of prussia on their way to conshohocken why would a tenant choose conshohocken over king of prussia especially if most of their employees are already living in the western suburbs reply lars says august   at  am i have to agree i used to live in philly or rather in a nice sub on the mainline and learned that it’s all about the schuylkill – ie the death trap interstate that is the main artery for traffic getting to the burbs to this location there is a long portion where this artery merges together into a two lanes creating one of the worst jams i ever experienced in my day this impacted my decisions all of the time on when i would venture out towards this area and wound up being not too often – too much of a treacherous headache philly is a gritty city with conshohocken a unique area but not one seen for high comers and well known as a complete pain in the ass to get in and out of reply jon  be net worthy says august   at  am sam i live about  from conshohocken but do not know too much about commercial real estate i can tell you that it is a “hot” area and well positioned with easy access to philadelphia and a few train stations as the article mentioned lot’s of people have been moving there for years it is considered to be a nice suburb to commute to philadelphia from and is relatively higher income consequently there would probably be demand for highend service providers to occupy that space from a macro perspective i would not have an issue investing in that area but again i don’t know too much about commercial properties or the factors that people may want to consider i’ll be following closely to see what others have to say reply financial samurai says august   at  am hi jon are there any particular reasons why the area is considered “hot” i’m all for hot but why do you think i agree that  miles isn’t too far away at all to commute to philly perhaps you have some friends in the area who can chime in reply jon  be net worthy says august   at  am i always hear new guys at the office talking about conshohocken lots of them end up moving there especially if they are married or thinking about kids it seems to be the place to go when people start families and want to get out of the city but remain close by reply jfd says august   at  am i think this is a very worthwhile subject you are now covering i’d like to be personally invested in real estate but also don’t want to buy a housecondo locally to rent because of all of the headaches i understand that come along with it i see crowd source re investing as an opportunity to be directly in the market managing risk and not having to be up in the middle of the night to fix a plumbing problem thanks for starting this subject reply financial samurai says august   at  am yes i’m reaching my limit w two rentals in sf and one in lake tahoe something is always going wrong last week the garage spring broke and i would rather simplify life i like buying physical real estate to enjoy and live in it and then rent it out with real estate crowdsourcing i’m purely focused on the numbersreturns now investing  –  here and there and letting others do the heavy lifting for a fee seems better than going allin w another multihundred thousand dollar downpayment or cash payment on just one property now but right now is incubation period where i will get as smart as possible before the large funds start getting deployed in  reply the mad consultant says august   at  pm i’d say that crowdsourcing is really changing the real estate investment market and for the better in my opinion especially in the commercial area which has historically been hard to access by the retail investor besides public reits fs i think it’s a good move to diversify your re holdings away from residential into commercial for your specific situation however i’m hoping to clarify your comment about “riding the inflation wave” from above is that in regards to commercial or residential real estate maybe start with small amount until you get more comfortable with these types of deals and i agree that i’d be conservative in my expectations compared to what the marketing material tells me note that’s not me giving the rubber stamp on this deal reply vickimake smarter decisions says august   at  am that is a really interesting opportunity we just visited friends who moved to ardmore – about  miles from there they purchased an amazing condo in a beautifully restored church and the area is full of colleges and universities too they looked for homes and had trouble finding one for a long time due to low inventory in the class of home they were looking for not sure if that helps at all but i could probably get some questions answered if you needed more information we’ll be following what you do here closely reply financial samurai says august   at  am i’d love for you to ask them about conshohocken and get some feedback if you don’t mind “low inventory beautiful area trouble finding a home…” all great things to hear from an investor’s pov thx reply vickimake smarter decisions says august   at  pm here’s what my friends who just bought the condo in the renovated church in ardmore said – “i am very familiar with conshohocken they call it conshie around here it is definitely a spot worth investing in has become more and more popular especially with the younger crowd tons of apartments and condos lots of renovations going on they recently finished the schuylkill valley nature trail that runs along the river through conshie so lots of people walk run bike on that and that is a big draw also recently a brewery opened along the trail so that also draws the younger crowd lots or restaurants and activities take place year round too so yes good place to invest” not sure if that helps at all – but thought i would send it along reply untemplater says august   at  am i’ve only been to phili a couple times and unfortunately don’t know the surrounding areas at all i’m also new to commercial real estate but wow the price per square foot on that property is so incredibly lower than what i’m used to seeing on residential properties in the bay area i like the concept of crowdsourcing properties in various parts of the country and not having to worry about any of the actual leasing maintenance and taxes yourself reply financial samurai says august   at  am one of my biggest problems is that everything except for manhattan i look at investing in looks so darn cheap compared to sf i need to be careful to confuse finding a bargain relative to sf prices versus finding a bargain versus the prices in that area this is why i’m more than happy to have local experts manage and invest my money writing out my investments can be anybody’s investment and discussing things will help me make a better decision reply austin says august   at  pm perhaps narrow focus based on demographic trends look where populations are growing rapidly reply dustin says august   at  am i invested in this deal and it was also my first with realtyshares i am not from the philly area but here are the reasons i chose it  like you i am also looking to diversify my investments with commercial real estate  the figures in the “financial summary” document looked reasonable despite not being able to verify the calculations would have been nice to see the spreadsheet version of the pdf  haverford properties has a professional online presence and a verifiable track record if you google them you’ll see articles from philadelphia magazine and others referencing their selection by the city of philadelphia to redevelop part of the delaware river waterfront the historic “knox home” in wynnewood and others  the current tenants from the rent roll seem stable and unlikely to vacate in response to raising rents to market levels  marcus  millichap predict office rent and occupancy increases this year in the philly suburbs and the overall office building investment outlook looks positive   glenn mueller of dividend capital research assessed office real estate in the philadelphia metropolitan statistical area msa to be in the late stages of the “recovery phase” of the market cycle as of q httpinfodividendcapitalcomrsdividendcapitalimagescyclemonitorqfinalpdf given that it should be close to or into the “expansion phase” by now the office market looks favorable for investment  most important my wife who is a cpa and more conservative than me when it comes to investments did not object reply financial samurai says august   at  am thanks for this dustin this is exactly the insights i’m looking to crowdsource “rents reach nineyear high philly suburbs attract opportunistic investors a steady pace of job growth and renewed interest in the philadelphia suburbs will support office rent and occupancy increases this year urbanization outside the metro core and access to a highly skilled workforce has elevated demand for suburban office space building activity will increase modestly to meet demand with new suburban space as well as intown developments slated

generate a rent hike pushing average asking rent to a postrecession high” maybe philly and its suburbs is the new seattleportland i’ll be ruminating regarding the returns… i’m really just looking to replicate  anything more is a bonus so if i cut  in half a  irr would be a grand slam for me let’s see do you have a list of the tenants and know what they do let me see if i can find it on the rs platform as well reply dustin says august   at  am yep from the “rent roll” in the documents tab insight medical southwark llc frederic i weinberg  assoc pc sales and marketing group not sure about this one global safety holdings inc as mentioned in the overview section of the offering the lease rollovers are staggered which should allow for a methodical valueadd approach reply another reader says august   at  am i would not touch this first it’s not a class a building it’s a class c neighborhood office building the market statistics that count are rents vacancy and lease up times for class c buildings in the immediate vicinity second look at google street view well maintained doesn’t look so good to me note the “space available” notice on the sign picture was taken in  so occupancy has probably been under  percent consistently drive the surrounding area using street view not exactly a class a neighborhood surrounding uses are residential light industrial and service commercial with a few office buildings mixed in the street is narrow the city public works uses are down the street a few blocks finally put the address in google maps and have a look at the tenant list in the sidebar not exactly credit tenants somewhere in the tabs that were not included in your post is likely a pro forma income and expense statement would love to see that no cap rate shown maybe it’s in one of the other tabs would also like to see the total debt payment the debt service coverage ratio and how that was calculated this property is an alligator for a small investor – a couple of vacancies can put the owner in foreclosure or loan workout in a hurry it takes deep pockets to continue making mortgage payments and shell out tenant improvement dollars when  percent of your gross income disappears this is the type of property you pick up in a down market for  cents on the dollar and retenant to catch a rising market for the resale from what i see it’s not a strong “value add” proposition as described reply financial samurai says august   at  am love it didn’t think about doing a google street view and checking things out virtually i have some twitter followers and readers who know the area who will check it out just checked it out looks like a nice sunny day on google sv i like the middle class neighborhood and the closeness to the river what suburban america might be all about i need to look into all the existing tenants and what they do the place doesn’t look like classa compared to the class a office buildings in the major cities but it is considered classa for the suburbs the stuff you see in sand hill road silicon valley ca are supposedly classa that all look like this place if not actually much older may i ask where you are investing your disposable incomesavings at this moment reply ras says august   at  am hi medium time reader first time poster i don’t think the suburbs have their own definition of class a class a is the empire state building the met life building etc suburbs just have class b and c’s and below generally reply financial samurai says august   at  am it’s all relative to the quality in the area check out definition below class a these properties represent the highest quality buildings in their market and area they are generally newer properties built within the last  years with top amenities highincome earning tenants and low vacancy rates class a buildings are well located in the market and are typically professionally managed additionally they typically demand the highest rent with little or no deferred maintenance issues class b one step down from class a these properties are generally older than class a tend to have lower income tenants and may or may not be professionally management rental income is typically lower than class a along with some deferred maintenance issues mostly these buildings are well maintained and many investors see this as a “valueadd” investment opportunity because through renovation and common area improvements the property can be upgraded to class a or a class b buyers are generally able to acquire these properties at a higher cap rate than a comparable class a property because these properties are viewed as riskier than class a class c class c properties are typically more than  years old and located in less than desirable locations the property is generally in need of renovation including updating the building infrastructure to bring it up to date as a result class c buildings tend to have the lowest rental rates in a market with other class a or class b properties some class c properties need significant reposting to get to steady cash flows for investors it is important for investors to understand that each class of property represents a different level of risk and reward class a provides investors with more security by knowing that they are investing in top tier properties with little or no outstanding issues requiring further capital expenditures however despite better property conditions class a can be sensitive in times of a recession if high income earners suffer from increased unemployment class b and c properties tend to be bought and sold at higher cap rates than class a as investors are paid for the additional risk of an older property with lower income tenants or a property in a lower income neighborhood the property class investors invest in can have a great deal of influence on the stability of an investment over time as well as its growth appreciation for investors looking for capital preservation class a may be the right investment for investors looking for capital appreciation class b and c may be better investments for that specific risk profile reply ras says august   at  pm that’s interesting i hadn’t realized it was broken down that specifically reply anon says august   at  pm class a in that market is  tower bridge  tower bridge  four falls this is tertiary it was distressed property which is why they lost their anchor tenant another reader says august   at  am cash and paying off rental mortgages when the market turns a lot of these speculative investments will collapse and once again the  cents on the dollar deals will be available reply steve adams says august   at  pm it’s interesting – i wonder if the re market is reaching another frothy point reply tara says august   at  am i can’t speak about commercial real estate but i can share a few things about “conshy” a it’s home to ikea usa b close access to a lot of major highways c property taxes are generally high in philly suburbs k homes in nice ‘burbs often have k annual except in conshy likely because ikea generates a lot of tax revenue for city d schools are great and home prices high reply brian tobin says august   at  am  it’s not home to ikea ikea is in plymouth township but it has a conshohocken zip code  conshohocken does have great access to highways it’s is a few minutes drive from i the blue route i schuylkill expressway and the pa turnpike it also has access to septa train line bus routes and the schuylkill river trail  property taxes are average but this has nothing to do with ikea see   schools are good and home prices are above average i agree average  br ba is probably around k note i live in conshohocken and work in west conshohocken reply financial samurai says august   at  pm hi brian – are you bullish on your area a  sfh for k seems pretty affordable based on the median income demographic figures any areas of concern you see in your neighborhood perhaps a large employer in the area who is going on difficult times etc man i just love to see home prices this affordable with decent income levels so different from sf reply brian tobin says august   at  pm the residential realestate is old stock so k is high most of the homes are twins or townhometypes that are small and dated a new hometwin sell for kk easy i sit on the conshohocken planning commission so i see the market a bit earlier then most new residential where there is any is looking like this  k httpwwwrealtorcomrealestateandhomesdetailwoodstunitconshohockenpam reply tara says august   at  pm why are property taxes so low then just plenty of income and lots of density i work in bryn mawr and with their income and home values property taxes are still high i can’t figure it out reply brian tobin says august   at  pm there is a lot of commercial properties near the river that help with the taxes there is also a  earned income tax so high earners lastly it’s a small borough it’s only  square mile so there is not much to suck up the tax money this borough was a different place just  years ago steel mill was closing lee tire factory was closing it was in big trouble some tough decisions in the s that resulted in the huge commercial expansion along the river lead to where we are today note the building financial samurai is referring to is only  blocks from all the new building that went up along the river here is an article i love to show people that know what conshohocken was like about  years ago broke httparticlesphillycomnewsbudgetcutsapartmentownersbuildinginspector reply brian says august   at  am great idea for a post so we can all learn i am on west coast where my returns for real estate are sub and i also was seriously looking at large apartment buildings in the south where there is good demographics and returns but trying to feel comfortable with doing out of area… when doing realty shares how are distributions taxed  i used to goto west conshohocken a bunch for work there are lots of institutionalbuy side money managers based there instead of in philly its good schools and affluent there lots of commercial office building complexes so i wonder how stable vacancy rates are due to supply a good resource is asking on biggerpockets forum for local pro opinion some very savy commercial investors there reply hailey friedman says august   at  am hi brian the tax reporting documents and the taxation regime applicable in realtyshares investments vary by transaction type and sometimes by specific deals within transaction types for debt investments and certain preferred equity investments investors purchase related debt securities notes of a realtyshares subsidiary for these investments investors will receive a int for the interest payments on their notes and such interest payments will be taxed at ordinary income rates regardless of the duration of the term of the notes for other preferred equity investments investors will become members of a specialpurpose limited liability company and will receive schedules k for such investments the payments on these preferred equity investments are still treated largely similar to interest payments however and such payments will generally be taxed at ordinary income rates even for investments that last beyond one year for common equity investments investors may enjoy certain potential tax benefits related to real estate ownership as with some of the preferred equity investments investors will become members of a specialpurpose limited liability company and will receive schedules k for such investments the potential tax benefits involved with common equity investments though means that investors may see depreciation mortgage interest and other deductions that often offset sometimes entirely the actually distributed cash payments received — so that investors may receive distributions throughout the year and yet in some instances have little or no taxable income these benefits if any are temporary in nature and involve deferral but not avoidance of taxes on the distributions received much or all of this tax advantage is generally “recaptured” later at the time that the property is sold that portion of returns that are attributable to the sale of an appreciated property will generally be subject to capital gains treatment which generally involves lower rates than gains taxable as ordinary income if you have any other questions about realtyshares feel free to send an email to contactrealtysharescom reply hailey friedman says august   at  am responding to this question” also how does one file for taxes for investments that are outofstate is there an extra step to take or do you just report the income like normal dividend income or is it like a k” as a general rule if an entity has an equitable interest in real property in a specific state that state will subject the partners to taxation assuming that state imposes income tax accordingly when you invest in a realtyshares equity investment opportunity that state will typically tax you and it does not matter what state you reside in if a state imposes a state income tax withholding and filing requirements are typically done under the following scenarios no state withholdings are made by the partnership and the individual partners are required to file state tax returns and to pay income tax on their respective share of the partnership income the partnership withholds state income tax on behalf of the partner and remits it to the state this withholding is then reflected on form k and the partner is responsible for filing the required tax forms the partnership withholds remits and files all information with the state and the individual partner is not required to file or pay anything this is called a composite or group filing state filing requirements are complex we strongly recommend that you discuss your state filing requirements with your tax professional reply brian tobin says august   at  am items of notes on conshohocken  there is a lot of new and planned construction in the borough please see this blog post that i did a few years ago on some activity httpwwwconshyorgathirdproposeddevelopmentofnewapartmentsinconshy  note the development at west elm and corson st is no longer a apartment

info so on a scale of   being a strong buy where are you i do wonder if there is an overbuilding of commercial real estate… generally happens closer to the top of the market then there is a bust and then no building for a while then repeat reply brian tobin says august   at  pm we’ll see the big problem right now with commercial build out is not the demand for space i foresee solid demand in my opinion it’s that bridge over the river all of the highway access is on the other side of the bridge so at rush hour its a bit of a mess i don’t know how they expect to remediate the problem but it may be a turnoff for continued growth conshohocken’s access to public transit and bike trails are what make the possible traffic issues a bit less what i do see is the big builders the o’neil properties equus capital and pulver are bullish on conshohocken commercial space they have investments with ’s at the end of them and they know a lot more then i do reply another reader says august   at  am hi brian i notice you mention the development on west elm the subject is on east elm a google street view drive shows this to be a much different area than the nicer areas of west elm the housing on east elm including across from the subject is reminiscent of the mill town conshohockon once was the city sewage treatment plant which reportedly has a long standing uncorrected odor problem is less than a block east of the subject building the location would be of concern to me as an investor can you tell us a little more about the subject neighborhood do you have any information about office vacancy and demand in the immediate area there seems to have been some newer development south of the railroad tracks adjacent to the river is occupancy in that subneighborhood strong what effect does the sewage treatment plant have on the subject property and those properties reply brian tobin says august   at  pm yes the sewage treatment plant is fairly close to the subject building i admit i live on the west side of town and don’t get to enjoy the odor as much as my neighbors with that being said the complaints have been heard and the sa is planning some additional remediation in order to alleviate the problem httpwwwconshohockensacominformationodorcontrolaspx i can’t say i know much more then what has already been mentioned my opinion on demand and vacancy is based on the bigtime investors the are putting millions of dollars into commercial residential and hotel space over the next  years even during the lows of  both commercial and residential vacancies were acceptable there were some but not many foreclosures and short sales right now the residential market is pretty solid i found some data here httpmarketminutelongandfostercommarketminutepaconshohockenlafayettehillhtm that shows positive numbers inventory is down prices are up and dom is down to only  days impressive… reply mrb says august   at  pm sam do you have an opinion regarding concentration risk for this relatively new product meaning in terms of your overall investment portfolio or net worth for that matter… i’m curious to know your appetite for risktaking  concentration  property is kind of where my head’s at that would limit me to the k investments at this point… so unfortunately this one is out as far as advice this is a bit anecdotal but i’ve heard from a colleague that is moving to that area that it’s the place to be right now from a residential standpoint i suspect that doesn’t help you from the commercial side of things however the greater population density can never hurt reply financial samurai says august   at  pm concentration risk is exactly why i’m hesitant to buy another physical property i recommendlike keeping real estate as less than  of total net worth the more diversified that  or less is the better at this stage i basically went “allin” with properties in sf that have done well but the market seems to be fading now  concentration is pretty small my investments with high conviction go to  –  of my entire portfolio i do like to make more concentrated bets i’m thinking of carving  of my  expiring cd in real estate crowdsourcing hence a  investment in this commercial property would be  reply mrb says august   at  pm fair i guess i’m still recovering emotionally from ’’ as far as real estate goes… stock markets bounced back in  yrs real estate still isn’t there… i understand past performance does not guarantee future results i guess even though i’m a regular reader i still question your confidence in real estate are you not seeing some of the irresponsibly freeflowing capital that we saw in the lead up to the last crash some would argue products such as this one we are discussing now are evidence of overconfidence in the sector… aren’t you better off investing in your own business reply financial samurai says august   at  pm did you have a bad experience between  and  a lot of areas have recovered to reach their previous heights and some places like new york and san francisco are way beyond their previous peaks lending and refinancing has been incredibly tight and difficult over the past six or seven years since the financial crisis the irony is that only the people who don’t need the money seem to be getting money to invest down payment levels are much much greater than in the past and if there is a downturn i suspect they much shallower one eg  versus  it took me almost  months to refinance my mortgage with the bank where i have more than  million in assets and a  year relationship with i’ve never missed a payment and i have an  credit score when people have a lot more skin in the game it is much more difficult to walk away from an underperforming property but due to the potential for a downturn i’m investing much less money in different locations reply marcos says august   at  pm question…what is the worst case scenario for this kind of investment losing interest only losing everything thanks reply financial samurai says august   at  pm i would think a realistic worst case scenario oh is that a recession hits in the area there is only a  occupancy and investors just collect half or less than half of the projected rents and hold until there is a recovery to be able to sell reply daryl says august   at  pm at  vacancy would they be able to cover the cost of the debt would they be able to hold until there is a recovery especially if that recovery happens after the “interest only” part of the loan expires it seems there is a reasonable chance that the bank forecloses on this loan and equity owners get nothing reply john says august   at  pm if you are bearish over the next few years on re why are you investing in these deals especially since it would be tricky to get out when i read the documents this seems like a note and there are a few firms with longer track record of buying notes for pennies on the dollar and also servicing it so you don’t have to deal with the headache of default i dont believe realtyshares services and would help convert the notes from nonperforming to performing reply financial samurai says august   at  pm haven’t bought yet john but will highlight when i do plenty of people also make money in bear markets it’s not a  one way loss for all investors you just have to go look and do your due diligence on various investment opportunities which is what i’m doing now i like to lock my money up for  –  years w a strong irr so i don’t have to deal w it bc i live below my means i have an excess of capital coming in every month that i’ve got to figure out what to do with it the big one is coming in q when a cd comes due what are you doing with your money and how are you exposed to real estate if any thx reply kevin tierney says august   at  pm conshohocken has an “awkward” location it has exits to  and  and close to the turnpike and close enough to  it also has two train stations as brian shared above morethanthecurvecom provides vacancy rates every quarter it has been sliding down and is now at a three year record low the one issue is that there is a million plus square feet approved but not yet built that could alter the market if they get built reply another reader says august   at  pm “i would think a realistic worst case scenario oh is that a recession hits in the area there is only a  occupancy and investors just collect half or less than half of the projected rents and hold until there is a recovery to be able to sell” if it worked at  percent occupancy the current owner would likely not be forced to sell there’s a reason the sponsor is coming to the table with less than  percent equity and crowdfunding the rest of the  percent and it is they can afford to take risk with this capital structure it’s easy for them to walk away i would love to know who is lending on this deal guess i will have to sign up for an account to get the full story reply steve adams says august   at  pm lots of these deals start with the founders only putting in  that’s part of the reason i look at them i want to see how to get a  down project with  irr not sure it’s worth the effort but interesting to look at reply justin says august   at  pm i work in commercial real estate private equity waterfall and fee structure are favorable to investors i think the fact that the sponsors are willing to take on recourse is a very good sign my concern would be on the exit and on releasing the space not sure how many questions you can ask on realtyshares but i would want to know the sponsor has a competitive advantage over current ownership to lease the space and that there are several tenants interested in the area i would also be concerned about an exit in  years especially with office product when we could be in the midst of an economic recession i think crowdsourcing is hard because you don’t know these guys at haverford and you don’t know their relationships in the market cash on cash is strong but that’s all contingent upon a quick leaseup with solid rents if you can find out answers to these questions and they check out i’d say this is a go for your higherrisk bucket reply financial samurai says august   at  am hi justin thanks for your insights i can ask realtyshares an endless amount of questions with answers but perhaps not so much the sponsor haverford properties but maybe i don’t see why i can’t just email them this post and have them answer questions unless there is some sec rule against that during a private placement offering i worry with you regarding exits as well who knows the future in  years it would be interesting if in  years conshy becomes a boom town and rents rocket and there is max occupancy why sell then just collect outsized returns every year for a s long as possible based on the feedback on fs from locals haverford has a good track record i’d like to reach out to them s reply zj thorne says august   at  pm this is fascinating to see everyone’s nuanced thoughts on this matter thank you for letting us learn with you reply scott says august   at  pm how does realtyshares work with  exchanges can a person  into and out of the property cheers scott reply quantakiran says august   at  pm i voted no after reading the post and all the comments i think the projections are overly optimisitic especially considering the tenant vacancy is at a  year low i think the markets are going to be unstable for at least the next two years and businesses are going to suffer as usual this leaves only  years for this to make you money i think you should stick to your rule sponsor should have at least  invested i also think they should at minimum guarantee your capital if they’re locking you in for  years and if possible guarantee a minimum return that’s what a bank does and the return is guaranteed there k is a lot of money imho to have sitting doing nothing for  years or worse to lose that capital if you invested it in a cd at  interest you’d get k after  years which is  of the original investment amount disclaimer but that’s just me with my very very very did i mention very limited knowledge of finance and investments i don’t like investments that take my money choose how to spend it don’t guarantee returns and not allow me any flexibility to move it when i see fit reply financial samurai says august   at  am ah i do love a guaranteed return over time a guaranteed return or a hedged return is why i’ve invested heavily in structured notes since leaving my day job in  here are some posts about structured notes httpwwwfinancialsamuraicomunderstandingstructuredderivativeproductscdsnoteasaninvestment httpwwwfinancialsamuraicomexampleofhowastructurednoteworks i’d love a minimum guarantee eg  a year  upside what i’ve also learned from private deals is that a lot of things are negotiable reply ravi a says august   at  am sam thanks for posting on this topic the idea of crowdsourcing due diligence is brilliant a few comments on the property starting with my background  i have been an active realtyshares investor for the past couple of years primarily using a solo k account  i look at public reits as part of my day job  i have been trying to invest in cre for the past year or so with primary focus on shopping centers in the midwest area regarding this property i would not be in a rush to invest given that it has been sitting on realtyshares website for more than a month – the amount they are trying to raise is not particularly high relative to previous commercial real estate deals – implies investors not particularly keen on this i think the main reasons are a long hold time of  years b office properties typically do poorly in a recession both from a lease as well as sale perspective vs multi family etc c optimistic assumptions on their ability to lease existing vacancy rent growthyear in their proforma as well as the lease rate assumption for a vacancy which seems to be on the market for a while see loopnet – lease rate assumption is sqft vs current market seems to be around  which is their most recent lease signed for similar sized space d relatively short duration lease with low credit quality tenants e you could easily end up with a flat to low single digit irr for equity depending on the vacancy rental growth and not just half the irr you are assuming in your conservative case and even a negative irr in a recession case i do like the economics in the deal which is more investor friendly – more typical for an experienced commercial team is to take  after the hurdle rate if you want to do more due diligence best to talk to commercial leasing agents in the area – easy to sign up for a free account and get a list from loopnet these agents usually have the best intel on the location the specific class of real estate as well as realistic rental and vacancy assumptions one such example is joe on loopnet – httpomegarecom disclaimer – i do not have any relation with loopnet or with joe the other issue we found while looking at cre is how the tax basis and the real estate taxes change when you buy a lot of times this can be passed on to the tenants depending on the lease but need info on the leases to make sure in this case looks the property sold for mm in  and about mm in  so the bump up in taxes is  from prev purchase price which is manageable we ran into situations where the property tax would double and was not fully reimbursable and was a deal killer for us there is plenty of question marks on this deal for me and not a fan of suburban office space hence my decision to move on and spend time on other deals i do think there is a high chance of recession in the next couple of years definitely in the next  years so i am more focused on single family debt for the solo k less attractive for after tax dollars as interest is taxed at marginal rate and multi family and neighborhood shopping centers which are more service oriented – for after tax investments please keep up the good work reply financial samurai says august   at  am hi ravi thanks for all the feedback i can see how investing in one’s portfolio can turn into a fulltime job for example let’s say i have  to invest and i plan to invest in   projects to do all that due diligence would take forever no wonder why so many people are happily willing to pay  management fee and invest a fund with a team of people who look at deals full time w hopefully more expertise i think their  irr target is simply just a target and probably a marketing target  is what i’d realistically shoot for and expect nice find on this property being bought for m in  m four years later doesn’t seem like a huge premium if this was sf the m would be worth m now i do agree the in a recession suburbs get hit hardest maybe we can collectively ask for more concessions before coming in for example i create a financial samurai syndicate in the amount of  that gets better terms this happens all the time in private equity deals any favorite public reits you’d buy now given that’s your expertise thx sam reply ravi a says august   at  pm sam agreed on the time consuming and often times frustrating nature of evaluating deals – i have spent probably  hrsweek for most of this year working with couple of other partners all of us have full time jobs and one is based in midwest who does all our local diligence looking at hundreds of operating memos and making offers on  and investing in  deal so far given the time we are spending we are making bigger commitments and looking to have  properties rather than  that you are looking to do regarding the price appreciation  change in  years seems like a bargain but as you well know bay area laps philly suburbs in job growth and rental growth of year vs flat to  growthyear in this philly sub market – i saw rents in the same sqft for office space  years ago as well based on the other comments in this thread though feels like this region is starting to revitalize which would mean this opportunity might turn out better than expected the syndicate concept makes a lot of sense once you get some critical mass as you do get much better terms particularly get rid of the fees on fees as you well know on public reit recommendations i am not allowed to peddle investment advise i do however broadly like the tower and self storage reits i am not sure if you have looked at realtymogul given your commercial real estate focus i have  investment with them and they have more cre deals vs residential focus at rs unfortunately the minimums are also higher for the commercial deals but both rs and rm have some flexibility on the minimums particularly if you have invested in a lot of their deals shhh you did not hear that from me i have lot more exposure with rs having done  deals mostly residential debt with them so far with year returns – which is my risk adjusted hurdle rate it also helped that rs was local and i met the ceo who is a fellow haas alum a couple of times – having a personal relationship goes a long way to create trust in this nascent asset class i believe you chose rs for a similar reason i also saw that you went to haas go bears cheers ravi reply another reader says august   at  am my focus has been the property ravi nailed the problems with the market the product type and the specific financial projections a recession at the five year point is a good possibility this property could easily drop to  percent occupancy or less at  fsg or less not including concessions and sell for mm in five years in a recessionary environment did not see the for lease info on loopnet there was space available in  when google drove by the deal is probably more investor friendly to make up for some of the property’s shortcomings reply chan says august   at  am if you end up investing in this equity deal shouldn’t you be filing state taxes in philly just to avoid the hassle of filing another state tax i’d pass on it unless i am investing k reply financial samurai says august   at  am pretty easy to do online just several clicks of a button w hr block and turbotax i’ll double check for you if you’d like reply another reader says august   at  am you are buying shares in a company not the real estate itself the shares are classified as securities i don’t think you would need to file a pennsylvania return reply another reader says august   at  pm look at hailey friedman’s comments i am incorrect – even though these are securities you or the company will pay income tax in pennsylvania reply the green swan says august   at  am great insight and dialogue provoking questions as i said before i’m not much for real estate investments so i can’t give much insight i’m also not in the philly area however wouldn’t such a large investment warrant a trip yourself to scope out the area and office building reply financial samurai says august   at  am  is a pretty small investment for me actually i was looking at buying a dream home with my parents for x that amount httpwwwfinancialsamuraicomaraceagainsttimebuyingadreamhomewithmyparents but yes if the amount you plan on investing takes up a significant amount of your net worth absolutely go out there and check the place out and do as much due diligence as possible reply joe says august   at  am thanks for posting this i’m learning a lot from this post and comment you are getting great feedback from local readers  return sounds unreal in this environment reply tim says august   at  am i live in philadelphia and think that conshy is one of the better burbs for a city dweller pretty easy to get the train there i have a friend who works at  elm street and it takes him about  minutes to get there from the north side of center city some businesses move there to avoid philadelphia wage birt  npt taxes the  transaction costs  commission probably includes transfer taxes which is why it’s higher than usual reply financesuperhero says august   at  am sam this may not be the direction you’d like to see this conversation head but i’m curious about your alternatives to the above investment even with the fine collection of information it is hard to evaluate this prospect in isolation on its own i don’t think i would have much hesitation on this one if i were in your position reply smm says august   at  am hi sam why don’t you make a business trip there and follow up with it via a post – to invest or not invest that way it’s business related and you can see firsthand interview people use other criteria seeing is believing reply financial samurai says august   at  am but it’s in philadelphia if it was in hawaii or in vail during the winter that would be another story  the whole point about the internet and crowdsourcing is to lower the cost of knowledge and the cost of due diligence so one can make smaller investments more efficiently instead of going all in google street view and financial samurai it is reply anonymous says august   at  am longtime lurker posting for the first time i live in philadelphia but commute to the suburbs for work i think it’s important to consider a few items and i’ll try to point a case towards the actual city or a different part of the suburbs  in terms of location there are often geographic demarcations to be aware of on a micro level these could be train tracks or the highway in some philadelphia neighborhoods you don’t want to live on “that side” of the tracks for instance on a broader level for metro philadelphia the demarcation is slightly less pronounced but i believe it to be the schuylkill river north of the river can range from working class norristown to upper middle class plymouth meeting conshohocken and recent college grads manayunk fine neighborhoods no doubt but there’s a stark contrast between those neighborhoods and the ones south of the river here we’re talking about old money the  and the  of the population this is also where many of pa’s top schools are one only needs to drive by harriton radnor lower merion etc to see the wealth of the area i recommend reading httpsenwikipediaorgwikiphiladelphiamainline there are suburban office parks sprawled along the main line which i could consider true class a properties many locations with density along route  are ideal if you want to move further along to the west there’s a bunch of office parks just off of  vanguard i have a few comments about transportation distancewise it’s not too far from the city but as several folks have mentioned i is always a nightmare i can’t overstate this enough you’d think it’d only take  minutes from conshohocken to the city but that time can easily be doubled on a routine basis so sure it has easy entry to the highway but i wouldn’t count on it actually functioning as a “highway” outside of  am and  pm this problem arises for all suburbs though for public transit septa regional rail which is the most commonly used form of public transportation to get intoout of the city commute times are similar however the main line has a crucial difference conshohocken doesn’t amtrak which will get you into the city almost twice as fast at maybe  more in fare so in terms of location i believe the main linekop area to be superior to conshohocken  geopolitical events i foresee the kop area developing more rapidly than conshohocken aside from the massive kop expansion there’s a potential rail project in the works which would seem to drive more foot traffic to the kop area through increased accessibility google kop rail for some insight there i don’t believe there will be an oversupply either i haven’t mentioned center city much yet but a huge incentive for new development is present in the form of the year tax abatement suburbs don’t have this the most famous beneficiary of this benefit is comcast did you know that according to my rough calculations for the duration of time about  years that skyscraper has been built they’ve only paid approximately k in property taxes or on average k a year now ask yourself – if you’re a business why would you locate in the suburbs at all if you can enjoy this massive tax benefit in the city while there’s no way to empirically prove it anecdotally this has contributed to a boom in both residential and commercial construction the most recent commercial corridor to take off has been the university city district spurred by penn medicine’s expansions when you’re in that area you literally feel like you’re a different city that’s  years more modern reply financial samurai says august   at  am excellent points seems like traffic is becoming a nightmare everywhere in the country this demonstrates robust demographic growth outpacing public transportation growth traffic also shows a backstop for demand for housing and office space overall theoretically every time i sit in sf bay area traffic to make myself feel better i tell myself this must be good for company profits which is good for company stock prices which is good for landlords to raise rents which is good for assets owners who will see their assets inflate if i didn’t focus on the positives of traffic i might very well move to montana a beautiful place i did the next logical thing was to move several miles west of city center to enjoy more peace and quiet since i no longer have a commute i do wonder about the structural demand for office space w more coworking space and more telecommuting but it seems like the economy is so strong right now that the leakage is not enough to counteract the wave of new workers reply matthew butner says august   at  am i almost laugh out loud when i read that commutes of  minutes are considered a nightmare in some communities having worked in washington dc san francisco and la i have heard of  hour commutes each way every day people don’t realize how good they have it reply dave says august   at  am i am active with rs and a few of the other portals i saw this one and passed biggest reason is i am not too high on office buildings in general because of long term demographic trends of much less actual space per employee due to telecommuting etc i am familiar with philly and suburbs and i do agree with the poster who wondered how strong the office building market really is in the speciifc locale that this building is in its not kop nor is it center city which are reakky the more eatablished markets reply dave says august   at  am one more thing the good equity deals on rs are filled in no more than a few days this one is taking longer so one has to assume it is not as good as many of their other deals reply john dutemple says august   at  pm this is a great articlethread not just informative but insightful as well i’m a novice ok wannabe in commercial real estate so i can’t contribute anything there and aside from a couple of weekends and watching trading places about  times know nothing about philly so if you think this comment is all take  no give feel free to dump it and i won’t be upset but you’ve been very generous in the spirit of gaining knowledge so if i may i’d like to piggyback on this post we have a real estate investors meetup group in st louis mostly  unit up to maybe unit residential apartments we would love to have someone with expertise about the ins  outs of investing better yet sponsoring on these platforms come speak to us preferably unaffiliated with the management of any specific platform we could not fly you out so if someone from the st louis area is out there reading please come share what you’ve learned thanks reply reguy says august   at  pm long time reader here who also loves real estate as an asset class the amount of feedback and local knowledge your post has generated is very impressive and really speaks to the value of your reader base i work in commercial real estate for a living and would vote no on this opportunity for the following reasons… i think the target irr is over inflated and the lack of sponsor equity in the deal scares me off when you don’t know the market and are not able to complete the dd yourself my two requirements on a crowd funded real estate deal would be proven track record and market knowledge from the sponsor seems to be true and significant coinvestment from sponsor which is not the case here below are my pros and cons on the deal pros  below replacement cost – at  psf this property would be purchased below replacement cost which somewhat shelters this investment from new development any new development would likely have a much higher cost basis and therefore would require higher rents for the deal to make sense and would maintain a higher yield if market rental rates were to drop  below market rent – possible for cash flow growth by rolling expiries to market the question here is what is market rent i would want to see what recent new deals were done at and what inducements were made  psf might be a low assumption for renewals  opportunity for increased occupancy – buying this property with  vacancy allows for additional upside through lease up cons  lack of sponsor investment – very little equity from the gp with  of their equity coming from the acquisition fee even with the favourable hurdle rate the sponsor has very little to lose if this deal doesn’t work out  short average lease term – with only  years of average term there is lots of lease turn over within the hold period which could lead to additional vacancy without being able to walk the building talk to tenants and understand the competitive properties this seems like a major risk to the cash flow due to the potential for increased vacancy andor leasing costs  inflated exit – exit at  psf seems somewhat high even if the property is  occupied the next investor would likely include a general vacancy allowance also when the property is sold in  years it will be  years old and likely reaching an age that requires significant reinvestment that the next buyer will likely include in their valuation reply stuart says november   at  am are you able to receive some of the tax benefits from the depreciation of the property reply todd says december   at  am this is just a general comment but it may be worth it i don’t necessarily see the need for crowdsourcing knowledge about purchasing a very small amount of an institutionalquality real estate asset other than helping the people reading the blog post and helping the egos of the people posting – possibly me that’s similar to engaging in a very long and detailed conversation about putting k into bonds you’re probably not gonna make a ton of money or lose a ton of money the roi on your time to discuss the issue is nill at best maybe you increase your portfolio percentage by  of a percent the worse part is the underwriting essentially seeing if the class a property is a good investment is exponentially longer and more complex notice the “cfa” designation behind the cofounder’s name they most certainly used argus software and inserted their assumptions that take most people years of experience to truly understand in addition they probably have someone that knows the local market very well and has pulled all the demographics construction starts lease expirations of office tenants in competing buildings and trends in the local office market absorption vacancy rates etc i think the crowdsourcing of knowledge would be better served for the company purchasing the asset as some kind of way to find out some inside knowledge about how to either add value to the project or notify them of a potential downfall crowdsourcing knowledge for the guy investing a small amount seems hard for me to see value however the reason i read this blog post is because i work in commercial real estate and i thought you’d be crowdsourcing knowledge on smaller private placements or syndications from smaller investors i think that’s a very interesting idea i’ve seen limited partners in syndications make  –  on consecutive deals and the sponsor  general partner making over  i was also in the industry during the downturn and had an incredibly wealthy client with three shopping centers anchored by circuit city first time i’ve seen a grown man weep after losing nearly everything fyi that’s also when i learned the importance of what’s called a cotenancy clause held by nearly every coanchor like office depot in neighborhood and regional centers once the anchor goes dark the coanchor’s rent goes way down…bad news so it’s not a boy’s game but with the crowdsourcing of knowledge and finding an investor group with a relatively small minimum investment and good track record the idea seems to make more sense in my opinion that’s a group that focuses on  unit multifamily or sf retail  commercial groups that deal with smaller properties may have good track records but the lack of understanding macroeconomic signs that the tide is turning of course i’m speaking in generalities here the guys that deal with class a properties have mostly had a job their entire life they’re probably the most intellectual guys in the room but they’ll be the first to admit their primary goal is never to hit a home run but to instead hit a single every time which is great if that’s your goal this is a relatively small class a asset but judging by the amount owned by this group they most certainly follow the same lowrisk strategy of the big boys like equity office and transwestern on a totally unrelated note if you’re just looking for consistent returns and not so much worried about asset appreciation or taxshielding the income i think the best investments that provide excellent returns commensurate with the risk are notes secured by real estate i happen to solely invest in these inside my ira two notes and roth ira one note so the tax issue is still avoideddelayed for me but it’s amazingly simple to find notes that pay  with strong borrowers at ridiculously low ltv’s like  and some even lower think about the last downturn and how much property values went down maybe some areas depreciated more than  but not many and if they did most have recovered fairly quickly so if the borrower doesn’t pay you you take the property and if it happens to be in the next worse downturn maybe you have a property at exactly the current market value well at least you can say you bought it at the bottom of the market  i just think that’s the best riskreturn for someone looking for consistent income the biggest risk in notes and only way i could see losing money on my investment other than outright fraud is being sued by the borrower so i stay away from owneroccupied properties and hire a professional loan servicer my opinion is younger investors should buy real estate for the capital appreciation  tax benefits and slowly build up a portfolio of notes possibly inside tax protected vehicles as they’re older so their cash flow is great for retirement but hey i’m an re guy i own no stocks or bonds the financial samurai is the annointed one with a more diverse and wellrounded and many times extremely creative understanding of how to compare two different asset classes so take my comment with a grain of salt sorry in advance if i was off topic or offended anyone here much longer response than i intended… reply financial samurai says december   at  am hi todd thanks for sharing some ideas i just love to learn and get as thorough as possible before investing larger sums of money i’ve started with  and plan to invest another  over the next  months i like this space like how they are forced to offer higher returns as rates have gone higher and am a big fan of real estate in general i just don’t want to buy another physical property anymore at my age and current portfolio i’m tired and want to simplify life happy holidays sam reply dave says december   at  am todd what sources do you use to find notes paying  w ltv’s of  all the crowdfunding notes don’t come close to that unless you look at ltv for the value of a “to be finished” flip which is not really the same thing reply todd says december   at  pm hey dave with all due respect to sam i’d rather not change the direction of his posting but i see them almost every day i live in ca and i never calculate ltv as arv…always current value not sure about other states the best notes i find are phone calls from relationships with hard money lenders and a few guys who run funds that find something outside their scope but there’s a very large lender out here that sends nearly a deal every day if sam’s ok with it i’m happy to share the url or maybe he can relay it to you one comment on the subject i think crowdfunding for commercial real estate deals is a great idea those deals need enough money where the crowdfunding is solving a true problem so re professionals see the value in it and enter that market…winwin even with pp i see the value of crowdfunding simply based on pure volume of people that want consumer debt unfortunately but with notes i live in socal and constantly see notes as low as k – k btw i think k is the minimum total note size to invest into considering the fixed costs of a trustee sale anything less and the fixed costs eat up the protected equity too quickly if it goes badly…in ca at least if you don’t have or want to invest that much it’s much better to find someone to split it with and know what you’re getting into with the property borrower and servicer look at this just from the worstcase risk standpoint with cre the sponsor will owncontrol it unless the lender takes it and you lose everything with pp you’ll get paid until you don’t…no collateral but with notes i think about downside as upside in many cases i don’t loan to own but i certainly don’t mind that scenario and i always underwrite that case before investing so if it’s crowdfunding for notes i’m assuming you’d be trusting the operation of a distressed asset people don’t lose wellrun properties to the lender in the hands of a lender or a receiver either of which will likely eat up that last little bit of upside through inefficiencies lender or exorbitant fees receiver you can do better yourself and if you have another beneficiary partner with you in the note make sure you have an operating agreement outlining who’s in charge of making the decisions during servicing default and after taking the asset back it all circles back to my belief that younger investors should focus on re for appreciation and tax benefits which will give them the experience to handle the notes if they go bad when they’re investing for cash flow later in life and if they’re reading financial samurai the entire time they’ll be ninjas with swords of cash reply dave says december   at  am sam if you are ok giving todd my email that would be great reply webbersworld says
