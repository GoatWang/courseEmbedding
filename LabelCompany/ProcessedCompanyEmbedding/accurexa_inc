distinct mechanisms for local delivery provides an opportunity to overcome chemoresistance while minimizing potential systemic toxicitywe are very pleased to collaborate with delmars experienced team allowing us to leverage their strong development capabilities  they have recently completed a phase iii clinical trial of val in brain cancer patients and had a successful endofphase ii meeting with the fda while we recently had a positive preind meeting with the fda for our acx wafer program  looking forward to the future development pathway we believe that the local delivery of val as a component of our acx wafer could potentially provide a new and exciting treatment option for brain cancer patients said george yu md accurexas president  ceoread moredelmar and accurexa believe that combining val with temozolomide andor bcnu within accurexas proprietary drug delivery system may provide treatment advantages while limiting systemic toxicity val is a firstinclass smallmolecule chemotherapeutic in more than  phase i and ii clinical studies sponsored by the us national cancer institute val demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating a number of cancers including lung brain cervical ovarian tumors and leukemia val is approved in china for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and lung cancer and has received orphan drug designation in the us for the treatment of gliomas medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer as well as in europe for the treatment of gliomaval exhibits its antitumor affect by forming dna crosslinks at the n position of guanine whereas temozolomide and bcnu primarily target the o position of guanine as their site of anticancer function vals mechanism of action appears to be unaffected by the expression of mgmt a dna repair enzyme that causes chemotherapy resistance to chemotherapies targeting the o position of guanine  delmar has also demonstrated that the combination of val and temozolomide was highly effective against brain tumor stem cells in vitrodelmar and accurexa will seek to establish a novel formulation which incorporates val into the acx polymer wafer and to establish nonclinical proof of concept regarding the proposed advantages of the combination therapy  delmar will supply accurexa with val and the companies will share certain limited costs associated with the research  delmar has been granted an exclusive option to license or acquire and commercialize product candidates and intellectual property resulting from the research for a defined period after the completion of the research  delmars option to negotiate a license or acquire the technology includes any and all results research materials related information and product candidates including without limitation acx and related intellectual property and all rights thereto on an exclusive worldwide basis or other such terms as the parties may agree in order to further develop and commercialize products based on the research project  both of our companies have already made significant investments into the ip mechanism of action and formulation of val and acx respectively  therefore developing a combined formulation is not expected to require significant cash expenditures  this collaboration is a highly costeffective approach to expand our product development portfolio by leveraging our companies respective capabilities and assets stated

name temodarabout accurexa incthe company is focused on developing and commercializing novel neurological therapies based on its proprietary branchpoint technology delivering therapeutics directly into specific regions of the brain the branchpoint device delivers therapeutics through the radial deployment of a flexible delivery catheter to large and anatomically complex brain targets through a single initial brain penetration clinicians can tailor therapeutic delivery to individual patient anatomy and specific disease targets which may enhance the efficacy of therapies the branchpoint device also gives physicians more precise control of the volume of therapeutics delivered and ensures that therapeutics delivered into the brain stay in the brain avoiding the problem of reflux out to the brain surface this modern and easy to use technology allows realtime monitoring of therapeutic delivery under interventional mri guidance imri which can improve the accuracy of therapeutic delivery reduce the risk of complications and increase patient safetythe branchpoint device was developed at the university of california san francisco ucsf with  million in funding from the

university of california san francisco lim regularly uses a surgical device to deliver potentially lifechanging treatments into patients brains but he thought the crude syringe invented in  could be better enlarge ucsf neurosurgeon dr daniel lim with the new device that he developed and accurexa inc… more carolyn seng for one every time parkinsons disease patients for example need cells transplanted into the brain some must endure upwards of  injections because implanted cells dont spread through brain tissue every penetration however risks setting off bleeding in the brain secondly lim said as experimental stem cell treatments progress it only makes sense to use a tool built to deliver those cells rather than one designed nearly three decades ago that could cut down on clinical trial failures at a critical time for scientists developing those treatments it seems mundane but its likely very important lim said targeted deliveries are going to be essential after using the standard device during a study of an experimental stem cell therapy at ucsf lim knew there must be a better way lim sketched his new device and turned it over to a group of uc berkeley engineering students who created a prototype then he won a  million grant in  from the california institute for regenerative medicine the states stem cell research funding organization to push it through preclinical testing now lim and accurexa inc the tiny san francisco company that hopes to sell the device are on the cusp of asking the food and drug administration for marketing clearance not unlike the current device lims instrument sits in a massive frame that is mounted on the head of a patient a hole is drilled in the skull and doctors deliver cells or direct brain stimulation or other treatments to the brain but instead of drilling multiple holes in the skull the accurexa device allows doctors to use a single entry point they then can insert the hollowed drugbearing plunger — the diameter of heavy thread — multiple times to multiple locations the device hasnt yet been used in living humans — only cadavers and none of them complained as the device delivered treatments to six locations in an hour in fact thats part of the beauty of the device it could deliver cells an electrode and gene therapy in a single session as a clinician i tried to think it all the way through lim said ultimately he said the device could convince some drug developers to look anew at experimental treatments that had been developed as oral drugs but which may be hundreds of times more effective when delivered directly into the brain accurexa which recently changed its name from cyto wave technologies otc bb cwav plans to submit an application to the fda next month for marketing clearance said george yu accurexas president and ceo the twoyearold company in december  licensed laser technology from the university of arkansas for medical sciences focused on detecting metastatic cancer cells that technology could take another three or four years to win fda approval yu said at some point accurexa will look for a larger partner to sell lims device as it works with the doctor to
