performed each year and most cannot be done without anesthetics due to the extreme pain the patients would experience anesthesiologists are responsible for administering anesthetics to patients and then monitoring how they respond to them before during and after surgery has been completed once the patients surgery has been completed they must recover from the anesthetics effects during this time they must be carefully monitored to ensure they completely regain consciousness and the anesthesiologist will decide if and when the patient has recovered to the extent that they can be released from the hospital the most important responsibility of anesthesiology is pain reduction either partially or completely many surgical procedures require extreme precision and if a patient jerks during the
