fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings around the world should be treated with dignity fairness and respect it is our companys intention to obtain products and services only from suppliers who demonstrate a serious commitment to the health and safety of their workers and operate in compliance with human rights laws for additional information about our commitment to responsible sourcing and other human rights see our standards of business conduct sbc at httpswwwrockwellcollinscomourcompanyethicsourstandardsaspxour conflict minerals position statement is publicly available on our website at httpwwwrockwellcollinscomourcompanycorporateresponsibilitymaterialdeclarationsaspx    reasonable country of origin inquiry rcoiour supply chain is complex and there are multiple tiers between the company and the mine rockwell collins is considered a downstream supplier or a “component product manufacturer” and does not procure metals directly from the mines or smelters thus the company relied on our direct suppliers to provide information on the origin of the conflict minerals contained in components and materials supplied to us including sources of tg within their products for the current reporting period the company surveyed direct suppliers who comprised the majority of our component spend during calendar      design of company’s due diligence frameworkthe due diligence measures captured in the company’s conflict minerals procedure have been designed in conformance with the internationally recognized framework the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd in the publication oecd  due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas second edition oecd publishing and the related supplements for tg that can be found at httpwwwoecdorginvestmentmnemininghtm the five steps from the oecd due diligence guidance document are listed below•step  establish strong company management systems•step  identify and assess risk in the supply chain•step  design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks•step  carry out independent thirdparty audit of smelterrefiner’s due diligence practices•step  report annually on supply chain due diligence     step  establish strong company management systems rockwell has established a management system to determine the source and chain of custody of tg in our supply chain additionally our company has an established conflict minerals team which oversees the due diligence process and includes representatives from finance legal manufacturing and supply chain we have also set expectations and procedures around our sourcing of tg as described below•conflict minerals procedurewe have developed an internal conflict mineral procedure that defines the process requirements to comply with the rule •supplier engagementthroughout the last calendar year we have taken measures to communicate the requirements of the rule and our expectations for compliance with our supply base in addition we maintain an electronic portal which suppliers can use to access resources related to tg including faqs from the aerospace industries association’s aia conflict minerals working group cmwg and the sec •grievance mechanismrockwell collins has an established ombsudsman hotline as part of our standards of business conduct policy which may be used by employees or outside parties to report violations of our policies and procedures       step  identify and assess risk in the supply chainbecause of our size the complexity of our products and the depth breadth and constant evolution of our supply chain it is difficult to identify actors upstream from our direct suppliers we rely on these suppliers whose components contain tg to provide us with information about the source of conflict minerals contained in the supplied components our direct suppliers are similarly reliant upon information provided by their suppliers many of the purchase contracts with our suppliers are multiyear contracts and therefore we may have difficulty in imposing new contract terms and flowdown requirements as we enter into new contracts or renew our existing contracts we are adding a clause to require suppliers to provide information about their source of tg and smelters in the meantime as described below we are working with selected suppliers to ensure they provide the tg sourcing informationwe requested that all identified suppliers provide information to us regarding tg and smelters using the template developed by conflict free sourcing initiative cfsi known as the conflict minerals reporting template the template the template was developed to facilitate disclosure and communication of information regarding smelters and refiners that provide material to a manufacturer’s supply chain it includes questions regarding a direct supplier’s conflict free policy its due diligence process and information about its supply chain such as the names and locations of smelters and refiners as well as the origin of tg used by those facilities we have determined that requesting our identified suppliers to complete the template represents our reasonable best efforts to determine the mines or locations of origin of tg in our supply chain we have reached this conclusion in part as a result of our participation in the cfsi     step  design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks although we do not have a direct relationship with tg smelters and refiners we do participate in industrywide tg initiatives within the aerospace  defense and electronics sectors the purpose of our participation within these industry groups is to enable us to obtain information from upstream entities within the supply chain as well as develop a standardized procedure for identifying socially responsible smelters and refiners the following is a list of the specific industry initiatives in which we participate•aerospace industries association aia conflict minerals working group•cfsi conflict free sourcing initiative which includes the cfsp conflict free smelter program•ipc conflict minerals due diligence committee•ipc conflict minerals data exchange task groupas part of our normal operating procedures should we learn of smelters in our supply chain who are sourcing from the covered countries and are not on the cfsp lists or active in the cfsp we engage the direct supplier and perform further due diligence     step  carry out independent thirdparty audit of smelterrefiner’s due diligence practiceswe do not have a direct relationship with tg smelters or refiners and therefore do not perform direct audits of these entities however we do support audits conducted by third parties through our participation in a number of industrywide initiatives as described in section  above     step  report annually on supply chain due diligencethis conflict minerals report constitutes our annual report on our tg due diligence which is filed with the sec and is available on our company website httpwwwrockwellcollinscom under the sec filings link on our investor relations page     due diligence performedthis section addresses the actions that the company took to exercise due diligence on source and chain of custody of tg within the supply chain    survey responsesat the conclusion of the supplier survey effort the company reviewed the supplier survey responses against criteria developed to determine which suppliers required further engagement these criteria included incomplete responses as well as inconsistencies within the data reported in the template from this analysis the company identified four categories that required additional followup•suppliers that reported they source tg from the covered countries•suppliers that reported their products did not contain any tg•suppliers that either provided incomplete responses or did not respond at all •suppliers that did not capture  document any smelter information    suppliers that reported they source tg from the covered countriesthrough the analysis of survey responses we identified suppliers that reported they have sourced tg from the covered countries upon further investigation through phone and email contact with the suppliers we understood that the components supplied to us may contain tg from conflict free smelters rockwell collins performed due diligence and determined that those suppliers fell into one of the following categories i supplier used a cfsi compliant smelter or ii chain of custody could not be performed due to insufficient information regarding the supply chain of the products provided by the supplier     suppliers that reported their products did not contain any tgthrough the analysis of survey responses we identified suppliers that responded stating their products did not contain any tg substances but that rockwell collins had reason to believe such responses may be inconsistent with our knowledge of their products we followed up with these suppliers providing information and education on where the tg could be located in their products such as metal alloying elements plating  surface finishes contained within the solder and also within electrical components themselves     suppliers providing either incomplete or no responsesthrough the analysis of survey responses we identified suppliers that either provided an incomplete response to our survey request or they did not respond at all in addition to the communications that were sent to suppliers during the request of information from our supply base these suppliers received an additional communication to educate and increase the knowledge of the suppliers regarding the rule    suppliers that did not capture  document any smelter informationthrough the analysis of survey responses we identified suppliers that either i did not provide smelter information or ii did not request smelter information from upstream suppliers we followed up with these suppliers providing information and education on the importance of requesting smelter information reminding them that smelters are in the best position to ensure the supplier of minerals via conflict free locations we encouraged suppliers to begin tracking information on smelters so that the collective supply chain can have comprehensive viable information relating to the chain of custody on conflict minerals    efforts to determine mine or location of originas stated in the rule which describes the content of the conflict minerals report “it is very difficult if not impossible to trace conflict minerals to their mine or other location of origin” after the smelting tin tantalum tungsten or refining gold processes the smelters and refiners are consolidating points for raw ore and are in the best position in the total supply chain to know the origin of the ores as the company does not purchase raw ore or unrefined tg our focus was to gain smelter information from industry initiatives and our supply baseto gain insight into the country of origin chain of custody and conflict status of our tgs we relied primarily on the findings of the cfsp established by members of the electronic industry citizenship coalition “eicc” and the global esustainability initiative “gesi” cfsp is a voluntary program in which an independent third party evaluates smelters’ and refiners’ procurement and inventory practices and determines as of the date of evaluation whether the smelter or refiner has demonstrated that all the materials it processed originated from conflict free sources even after cfsp validation it was difficult for the company to identify valid smelters and refiners directly used in our supply chain as a majority of the information that was provided from our supply chain was at a company level rather than at a product level which is required by the rule listed below are the smelters and refiners we believe to be potentially in our supply chain for  the presence of a smelter or refiner on the list does not indicate that rockwell collins products necessarily contained tgs processed by that smelter or refiner as our engagement with the supply chain evolves our list of smelters may change to reflect improvements in the quality of information provided to us the location information and compliance status is as reported by the cfsp as of may   metal smelter reference list smelter country cfsp compliance statusgold aida chemical industries co ltd japan compliantgold allgemeine goldund silberscheideanstalt
