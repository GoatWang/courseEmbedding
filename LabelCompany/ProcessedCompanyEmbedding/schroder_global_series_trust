year for convertible bonds to prove their worth 00 dr martin kuehle investment director convertible bonds convertible bonds offer a potentially attractive combination of low duration and long equity participation sudden market setbacks could be triggered by negative shifts in sentiment swings in market liquidity or unanticipated shocks in fundamental economic data investors are so used to low and negative interest rates that they will be in for a surprise when rates turn convertible bonds with their inbuilt stabilisers could be an ideal asset class for these markets most investors look at the world through the rear view mirror those looking back at 0 will see a surprising lack of volatility global equity markets calmly shrugged off both brexit and the election of donald trump as the new us president at the same time rates have remained historically low and the negative rates for government bonds in germany japan and switzerland were regularly in the headlines looking ahead this will change volatility can and will come back to equity markets but it will come back at an unexpected point in time and from an unexpected direction in risk management there is the idiom of “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns” a term going back to nassim taleb and before that the former us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and his work on socalled “black swan” events elections rate rises by central banks or financial rescue packages for european states are known or at least expected events for 0 even if we do not know the outcome or the market reaction yet for some of these events markets are prepared the market reaction to a potential federal reserve rate hike in december this year will hopefully be different to the one last year for all other unknown unknowns the market outlook suggests to us that the downside protection offered convertible bonds will be valuable in 0 investors have short memories it is important to remember that interest rates can go up as well as down this does not have to be a general paradigm shift towards widespread rising rates but we see that interest rates can move upwards suddenly and surprisingly strongly when that happens traditional government and corporate bonds face losses the potential losses on the bond market are higher for bonds with higher maturities this risk is expressed as duration risk company treasurers have taken the opportunity to refinance and leverage up with the environment of low coupon payments overall fixed income indices show a clear trend duration risk is significantly higher for conventional bonds compared to convertible bonds – and this risk position has drastically increased over recent years why are convertibles so insensitive to rates first of all a lot of convertibles are issued with a maturity of just five years more importantly they come with a conversion feature investors have the right to convert the bonds into stocks this brings equity upside participation to the asset class but the hidden gem in this conversion is the put on the bond a true conversion not only includes receiving equity it also includes getting rid of the bond as a longrunning option right we do not have to exercise this conversion right as soon as the structure of the convertible moves closer to conversion price and builds up equity exposure the interest rate part becomes increasingly unimportant to verify the practicalities of the structure we need to go back in time to find longer periods of rising interest rates there have been five periods with negative performance of government bonds  and hence rising rates  in the last few decades these periods are different in length as well as in impact but they have one characteristic in common convertible bonds performed very well each time in our view 0 will be a year where protection becomes an important feature for our investors’ asset allocation at the same time it continues to make sense to build up smart equity exposure if we are right we will see supportive equity markets driven by a general shift from expansive monetary to expansive fiscal politics in this environment wellstructured convertible bond strategies have been shown to participate in a significant 5 to 0 of the equity upside comparing convertible bonds to other asset classes the advantages are compelling low duration risk strong stockmarket participation on the way up and hence an inbuilt inflation adjustment effective protection against shortterm setbacks and to top it all an underresearched and overlooked niche asset which comes at attractive valuations share
