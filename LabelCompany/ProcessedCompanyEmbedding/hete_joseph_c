one of the best growth years in our history revenues rose  percent or  million to  million as we substantially expanded our  fleet and placed more of them with key global companies revenue growth excluding fuel and other reimbursed expenses increased  percent that growth was spread across our principal business units it stemmed largely from groundbreaking agreements we signed in march with our newest customer amazon fulfillment services our positive outlook for  and  is for more growth and an even more diversified revenue base dhl and amazon our two largest customers accounted for  and  percent respectively of our revenues in  because of our unique positioning and key investments we were ready when amazon asked us to help create its own dedicated us air express network in march  which called for twenty boeing  freighters we would lease to and operate for them we supplied them with fourteen of the twenty leases by the end of  and another in early january this year we will complete deliveries for the remaining five by july in  we expect to add a record eleven  converted freighters to our inservice fleet together with two boeing s we will acquire convert and lease to our jointventure partner in china we expect to have seventythree owned aircraft in service by yearend of which fiftyfour will be dry leased under multiyear terms our amazon agreements also included our commitment to issue them warrants for up to  percent of our common shares by september  at an exercise price of  per share we issued warrants for nearly  million shares in  and will issue warrants for another  million shares this year none have been exercised to date but over time generally accepted accounting principles gaap require us to reflect their value in our financial statements and their potential issuance in our diluted share counts these warrant effects which are noncash mask a significant portion of our operating earnings and cash generating strength consolidated net earnings from continuing operations in  were  million or  cents per share diluted which were lower than in  those  earnings however included a combined  million or  cents per share in noncash aftertax reductions for revaluations and lease incentive amortization related to the amazon warrants we expect those effects to have a significant but unpredictable impact on our gaap earnings until the warrants expire or are exercised because changes in our stock price account for a large portion of the warrant value variance in our earnings releases and investor presentations available on our website atsginccom we will continue to provide adjusted nongaap results that exclude the warrant effects and other noncash or nonrecurring items following our gaap financials other onetime or limitedterm items affected  results they included  million or seven cents per share in forfeited revenue related to a twoday walkout last november by pilots at our abx air subsidiary premium pay for our pilot workforce was significant in the second half as it took longer than planned to hire train and place the additional pilots that abx air added for the amazon agreements nearly all of that additional  expense and lost revenue was captured in our acmi services segment results which includes our airlines that segment loss was  million pretax most of that loss was for items we do not expect to recur or will be substantially lower in  for example we expect normalized crew costs after the first quarter as we reach our pilot staffing targets also pension and other postretirement expenses will be lower this year as a result we are cautiously optimistic about a profitable  in acmi services the outlook is very bright for cam our aircraft leasing subsidiary as revenues rose  million to nearly  million and pretax earnings rose  million to  million cam completed eighteen new  dry leases in all last year including aircraft returned from other lessees fortyone of cam’s fiftytwo s were externally dryleased for multiyear terms at the end of  ten s were in acmi service with longtime customers at yearend including some awaiting delivery of a  when more become available later this year cam also received orders for s from customers besides amazon last year that meant they were very active scouting out good freighter feedstock prospects and booking conversion slots before prices adjusted to additional market demand the freighter feedstock cam has purchased and is converting is already spoken for we will buy more in  and expect to end the year with fiftytwo of the s cam has in service under external dry leases and six others undergoing cargo modification for anticipated  deployments as we expand our fleet however we remain prudent investors of your capital we will invest only in response to specific demand from companies with strong track records of their own some of this demand is from customers that would have already leased a converted  from us if we had one available today amazon’s huge appetite for s has filled the available conversion slots into  and made them hard to find from any source due to our experience and relationships in the midsize aircraft conversion market however we can still secure high quality feedstock and conversion slots without compromising our returns on invested capital the businesses we collectively refer to as other activities contributed a large portion of our  revenue gain their revenues were up more than  million from  to  million pretax earnings from other activities increased by  million to  million for the year our aircraft maintenance business ames is now substantially larger with the addition of pemco world air services as a division pemco’s conversion resources are focused on the  freighter market in china where narrowbody freighters are still the preferred option for domestic air cargo networks pemcoconverted aircraft make up more than  percent of chinabased boeing  and  fleets in service the company has redelivered over fifty converted s to operators there since  and received orders for three more in february pemco will also convert two more s that cam will acquire and lease to okay airways cam’s first of that type chinabased okay will put them in its own fleet under customer contract pending transfer to a new cargo airline that we and other partners will own pemco’s heavy maintenance capabilities and hangar space in tampa are good complements for those at ames in wilmington they hold certificates for maintenance of both boeing and airbus types and we expect to use their facilities to handle a sizeable share of our own expanding heavy maintenance requirements we expect a significant positive contribution to our earnings from pemco this year lgstx services our materials handling sorting and ground support business expanded in  as it added cargo handling and refueling for amazon in wilmington in  amazon will shift its main hub to new facilities at the cincinnati regional airport in kentucky with some corresponding impact on lgstx a portion of that reduction at lgstx will be replaced by results from pemco on our other activities line taken together these strong businesses and initiatives indicate a company with excellent growth potential backed by longterm agreements with customers maintaining that growth will require significant added capital investment this year which we currently estimate will be about  million in total and  million for growth in addition to our strong cash flow we will draw more from our revolving credit facility which was expanded in  and will expand again in  it will add credit capacity and some additional flexibility but we expect no change in our rate structure even with additional borrowings we expect our financial position to remain conservatively levered with a debt ratio below three times ebitda throughout  assuming a smaller fleet growth program in  we anticipate more flexibility for allocating our increasing cash flow in addition to our capital spending and pemco purchase we also spent  million last year to repurchase  million atsg shares including the  million shares purchased from an affiliate of red mountain capital our largest shareholder in july the board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization last may from  million to  million and  million of that authorization remains our demanddriven fleet expansion will still permit us to allocate cash at our disposal prudently among investments share buybacks and debt repayment our growth phase is in its early stages and potential lease customers are still calling us about their longrange needs keep in mind that in  many of the leases cam added were for our s in  all of the s we lease will be for larger s with longer terms and higher monthly rates assuming interim extensions or replacements of expiring leases it’s not hard to envision continued growth with solid margins into the next decade our growth also speaks volumes about the talent and efforts of the employees of our atsg businesses and the commitment of your management team and board of directors to translate their efforts into stronger returns for you the shareholders those of you who have supported our efforts over time have been well rewarded over the last one three and fiveyear periods through  our stock price increased at more than twice the rate
