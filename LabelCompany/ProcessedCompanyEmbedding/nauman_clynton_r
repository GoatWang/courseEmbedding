naumans experience title various executive and operations positions company kennecott utah copper corporation job details at kennecott we are committed to researching and implementing additional ways of increasing power supply and energy efficiency throughout our operations the new million megawatt mw combined heat and power chp system that we commissioned in december  at our refinery is an excellent example of this commitment the chp system is more than  percent energy efficient compared to separate heat and power systems which are estimated to be less than  percent efficient the mw chp system produces enough electricity to power  averagesized homes chp also known as cogeneration is an efficient clean and reliable approach to generating power and thermal energy from a single fuel source the refinery chp system meets the steam requirements of the refinery and provides up to  percent of the electrical needs of the plant the steam produced by waste heat from this chp system replaces steam that was previously supplied by a natural gas boiler system it increases the facilitys operational efficiency and decreases energy costs at the same time chp reduces the emission of greenhouse gases which contribute to global climate change chp technology represents an innovative approach to energy planning because the electrical power is being generated onsite rather than at an offsite power plant  an approach called distributed generation the chp system uses a naturalgasfired turbine generator combined with a heatrecovery steam boiler to capture heat from hot turbine exhaust for the efficient production of process steam used at the refinery in addition to powering  percent of the plants electrical needs the chp system reduces air emissions by more than  percent we will soon install a similar mw chp unit at our new molybdenum autoclave processing map facility in  bringing the chp investment to  million with the addition of the refinery chp our power supply from alternative and highefficiency power sources is now at  percent when the map chp comes online in  our power supply from alternative highefficiency power sources will be at  percent title board member

president and chief operating officer and myself mike clark chief financial officer we’ll have an opportunity for a questionandanswer period after our presentations before we get started i need to remind you that some statements made today may contain forwardlooking information our business involves a number of risks that could cause results to differ from projections and investors are urged to consider those disclosures and discussions pertaining to risks that can be found in the company’s alexco’s sedar filings it should also be noted that past performance discussed in this conference is not indicative of future results so now i’d like to turn the call over to clynt nauman clynton nauman thanks mike thank you for joining us today for our review of the  fourth quarter and the  year at the outset i would like to apologize for the delay in filing earnings and related financial statements until yesterday wednesday instead of tuesday as previously advised as we can probably appreciate based on the news we were little over ambitious thinking we can put a pin in all moving parts at the same time and we elected to wait until everything was complete so that you can see the whole picture  a picture which i think is a start of rebranding the company from explorer developer to developer and hopefully producer we released our financial results yesterday outlining a net loss of  million for the year ended december   at the end of the day noncash costs makeup much of this loss and these will be explained later by mike alexcos unrestricted cash position at december st was  million while networking capital was  million because i say it more from mike a little bit so what were planning to do on the scroll is to cover three or four important areas and recent accomplishments at the alexco which together will hopefully paint the picture of where we are and where we’re going i’ll start with the few  highlights we’ll move on to a description of the amendment of the silver purchase agreement between alexco and silver wheaton signed yesterday and at that point brad thrall will pick it up and outline the highlights of our updated pea also filed yesterday and finally mike clark will walk through some reasonable financials in terms of  highlights most of you are aware of course that we completed a very successful diamond drill program at the bermingham deposit last summer drilling about  holes for a total of just over  meters drill was also extended the previously defined arctic zone of silver mineralization and outlined a new zone of highgrade silver beginning approximately  meters from surface and extending at least  meters down plunge were remained to open this was a basis for an updated mineral resource and that expanded the indicated mineral resources of bermingham from  million ounces to  million ounces while inferred mineral resources increased from approximately  million ounces to  million ounces of contained silver you will be aware of course with some of this mineralization is very high grade but that’s not necessarily unique at the keno hill and its historical perspective second point in terms of highlights as i said earlier on may ’ and  we closed a nonbrokered private placement primarily with sprott wealth management for gross proceeds of just over  million which helped bolster our cash position to an ending balance of  million at yearend as previously mentioned and lastly in terms of these highlights aeg had a positive year with over  million in revenues maintaining a gross margin of  the reduction of revenues in  is mostly related to a slower pace of the planning work of the keno hill clean up for the federal government of canada and that work is expected to increase in  and also the lower revenues are related to a smelter completion of construction or remediate work of the globe and gold team projects in colorado before moving on to the discussion of silver wheaton i will highlight that in  we’re planning to continue our service exploration program at bermingham and in the immediate vicinity where we see opportunity to test additional blind structural targets then mimic the bermingham structural setting we’ll drill at least  meters another  million odd and the bulk of the service exploration to be carried out in this summer with result expected no latest than the fall of  so moving to silver wheaton as you may have seen in the press release filed yesterday we signed an amendment to a silver purchase agreement with silver wheaton we believe that this announcement along with the updated pea represents an exceptional outcome for alexco and positions the alexco shareholders about as well as can be expect for longterm success in the keno hill silver district the new arrangement with silver wheaton is innovative the silver wheaton stream remains  of payable silver but the production payment is silver wheaton makes to alexco for silver varies on a combination of head grade and silver price and on this basis in a grade and pricing curve which has both the floor and ceiling in terms of grade and price the production payment will increase with lower silver head grades and lower silver prices and will decrease with higher silver head grades and higher silver prices to put this simply the structure accommodates continuing production through periods of low prices and meets the additional objective significantly improving mine efficiency as it brings into the mine plants lower grade material they may have been uneconomic under the prior agreement by way of example at todays spot prices with an average fee grade of  grams silver per ton as is reflected in the pda the production payment would be  but if those head grades fail to say  grams per ton the production payment from silver wheaton would be approximately  per ounce conversely if we are mining  gram per ton material high grade material the payment is closer to  per ounce of silver clearly the arrangement is a catalyst to spare redevelopment and put alexco on the road to future production at keno hill finally this structure not only protects us during periods of lower silver prices but it does so without limiting the upside opportunity of either alexco or our silver wheaton we have worked very hard with our partners at silver wheaton to device this innovative and flexible structure that will enable sustain production over the long term and we certainly commence silver wheaton for their dedication of time and effort to arrive of this mutually beneficial outcome to be fair i think it also points to the resilience of alexco at the end of the day we continued exploration during a period of tough markets and suspended operations and we have been rewarded with about eight years of new mine life primarily in two discoveries flame  moth and bermingham totaling about  million ounces of new silver resource and average grade of around  grams per ton just to reiterate and as you have seen in our press release we have provided the formula for determining production payment that we will receive from silver wheaton while it may appear complex the resulting production payment is simply a percentage of spot silver price that changes based on silver grade and price by focusing on the two key determinates of sustainable longterm production namely price and grade we believe that weve landed on a formula that provides the flexibility not only for our existing mines but also future discoveries at keno hill as consideration for entering into the amended silver agreement alexco has agreed to issue  million shares to silver wheaton we are pleased to welcome silver wheaton as a shareholder and appreciate their vote of confidence in alexco and continue support for keno hill in summary this amendment is exceptional outcome for alexco it is innovation and it is accretive to our shareholders from a net asset value perspective it also positions the keno hill silver district clearly on a path toward redevelopment and ultimately a production decision at this point i am going to turn it over to brad thrall to review the results of the pea brad thrall thanks clynt and good morning everyone as clynton mentioned i am going to walk through the pea and just provide a high level overview of some of the more selling points of the pea that we did file yesterday evening the pea incorporates a multimine four mine plant at the keno hill district expands a nine year development on operating period the time period in the pea begins in the second quarter of this year  and extends into the fourth quarter of  during this period the total ore mine from four separate underground deposits includes  tons of ore at an average head grade of  grams per ton of silver  lead  zinc and about  grams per ton of gold the pea lays out a mine plant and is centered on the production from the flame  moth mine which provides about  of the total life of mine indiscernible over this period supplemental ore is then sourced from the bellekeno mine during the first six months of the plan and then followed by flame  moth and bermingham mines operating together over the next five years near the end of the mine life the lucky queen mine comes on stream and provides additional mill feed for the remaining two years of the project life prior to a production decision our plan is to drive  meter decline of bermingham this year and complete in advanced underground exploration program totaling approximately  units of drilling underground the nominal production rates for each of these mines are designed around  tons per day from bellekeno  tons per day from lucky queen  tons per day from bermingham and  tons per day from flame  moth mining methods are predominantly all mechanized cut and fill with the trend toward longhaul and drift and fill mining methods in areas of increased thickness of vein the life of mine production schedule includes an annualized average production rate of  tons per day over an eight year operating period and that results in approximately  million payable ounces of silver per year the total payable production of metal over that project life is approximately  million ounces of payable silver  million pounds of zinc  million pounds of lead and  ounces of gold more importantly during the first three years of full production while the flame  moth and bermingham mines are operating together the production profile includes a  tons per year of ore processed through the keno district mill producing  million ounces  payable ounces of silver per year the average silver head grade during that first three full years is just over  grams per ton in terms of the overall economics of the project and the pea the pretax and after tax npv is  million and  million respectively and the pretax and aftertax irr is  and  respectively these economics are based on silver prices of  announce in  and then longterm consensus price  in  through  using today approximate spot metal prices and uscanadian forex the project has a pretax and aftertax npv of  million and  million respectively and a pretax and aftertax irr of  and  respectively the initial capital cost to achieve production and positive cash flow is estimated at  million and this results in less than a one year payback operating costs are estimated at  per ton of ore and that includes mining processing and allsite ga there is an additional  per ton of ore of capital that accounts for sustaining mine development capitalized property plants and equipment underground definition drilling and overall contingency the net smelter value  the net smelter returns value of the ore over the life of mine in the pea is  per ton as you know the keno district mill facility operated successfully for nearly threeyear between  and  the milling process including conventional crushing grinding differential flotation and dewatering processes and produces a lead silver concentrate and a separate zinc concentrate these concentrates are then shifted by truck to port of skagway in alaska where they put on an ocean barge for delivery to the smelter prior to resumption of milling operations and additional  by  meter ball mill will be installed to provide expanded draining capacity ahead of flotation circuit this mill has already been purchased and delivered to the site all of the surface facilities camp accommodations and infrastructure including the keno district mill are being actively maintained and will require only normal cost for decommissioning in terms of metallurgy we of course have the benefit of having operated the keno district mill for nearly three years and have a good understanding and estimate of recovery of lead silver and zinc additional test work has also been completed on the other deposits within the mine plant and they respond well to the current no flow sheet due to the change in the leadsilver ratios in the mill feed the lead concentrate grades during the commercial production will be in the order of  lead and  grams per ton of silver which of course is a very valuable product once we achieve commercial production the calculated allin sustaining costs on a contain silver by product basis will be approximately  an ounce the allin sustaining costs includes direct operating costs sustaining capital the silver wheaton stream corporate general and administrative costs and ongoing service exploration costs during the first threefour years of production the allin sustaining cost is estimated to be us ounce of silver in terms of permitting all of the regulatory approvals required for mining and processes activities associated with the bellekeno and lucky queen deposits are currently in place with the exception of the water use license all of the regulatory approvals required for mining and processing activities associated with flame  moth are currently in place we anticipate receiving the water license for the flame  moth mine in late q of this year permitting for the advanced underground exploration phase of bermingham is also underway so with this i’m going to turn over to mike clark to review the financial numbers and until we will have questions later on about the pea mike michael clark thanks brad this financial report is for alexco’s fiscal year ended december   note that we report in canadian dollar so all dollar amounts will be in canadian dollars unless stated otherwise for the full year we reported a net loss of  million or a loss of cad per share these results include noncash cost totaling  million which is mostly comprised of depreciation and sharebased compensation expense this compares to the  net loss of  million or cad per share the main different between the loss in  and  is a reduction in general and administrative expense and care and maintenance costs offset by less gross profit in the environmental business for the fourth quarter of  alexco reported a net loss of cad million or cad per share on revenues of cad million which compares to a  net loss cad million or cad per share on revenue of cad million alexco environmental group revenues for the year ended december   were  million on gross profit of cad million for a margin of  this compares to revenue last year of cad million and a gross profit of cad million from margin of  the increase in gross margin from the prior year was primarily due to aeg reducing thirdparty work on both external projects and the keno hill reclamation plan the reduction in revenue was primarily due to the bulk of the keno hill reclamation plan being developed in  and then entering the review stage process in  which involves less billable work to be performed by aeg furthermore in the us a decrease in revenue is resulted from the substantial completion of the globeville project in colorado in  corporate general and administrative expenses for  totaled cad million including noncash cost of cad million which compares to the  cost of cad which included cad of noncash cost the decrease in  relates to onetime charges in  for severance cost and rightoff of receivables for cad partially offset with an increase in sharebased compensation expense aeg general and administrative expenses for  totaled cad million compared to  expenses of cad million the decrease in aeg general and administrative expenses in  compared to  is a result of higher personal utilization to billable projects as well as continued reduction of overhead expenses furthermore during the  period the corporate evaluation the corporation evaluated certain trade receivables and recorded a onetime right off of cad mine site care and maintenance costs in  were cad million compared to cad million in  the decrease in cost is mainly due to lower depreciation charges in  and its worth noting included in mine site care and maintenance cost is depreciation expense of cad million in  and cad million in  exploration expenditures incurred during  cad million compared to cad million in  in  the nature of the majority of these expenditures were related to the  drilling program at birmingham flame  moth portal development the reengineering work being done on the flame  moth deposit and the lead up work associated with the pea in may  alexco closed a nonbrokered private placement of  million units of the corporation at a price of cad unit per gross proceeds of cad million each unit consisted of one common share and a half warrant with each full warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional common share of alexco at a price of cad per share for a period of two years the warrants included acceleration costs whereby if the closing price of alexco shares is higher than cad for a period of  consecutive trading days then the company has the option to accelerate the expiry of those options to  days alexcos unrestricted cash position at december   was cad million compared to cad million at december   while networking capital was cad million compared to cad million at december   the increase in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in  compared to  is mainly attributed to the main nonbrokered private replacement for gross proceeds of cad million cad million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants cad million from the sale of marketable securities and cad million from the release of performance bonds offset by cad million posted a security at keno hill the cad million for exploration expenditures and then general corporate overhead in addition to unrestricted cash alexco also has restricted cash at december   of cad million which primarily relates to decommissioning obligations at keno hill and subsequent to year end the company sold marketable securities for further proceeds of cad million now the operator will provide instructions for the qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and we’ll now take our first question from mike kozak with cantor fitzgerald mike kozak few questions from me the first one just to understand correctly so you’re getting kind of more protection on the silver industry were getting kind of more protection on the downside in terms of silver price and silver grade but a north of  an ounce regardless of the grade silver it doesn’t make any transfer payment to you on the  is that  am i thinking about that right clynton nauman mike this is clynt that is essentially correct you need to keep in mind that’s not necessarily a linear relationship but it is true that once the prices get to be north of  bucks that the silver wheaton payment is minimal to zero i would also point out that the difference between say  or  market that we are in at the present time within aftertax npv id say  million to  million that aftertax npv increases by more than  and as you trend up towards that  so i guess my  i guess it might be i dont if its a glib statement or not but generally what i would say is lots of money in a project like this with a better than  gram head grade to go around lots of money to grow around if prices and when prices achieved that level mike kozak right and then that kind of reason to my second question that is so with where the silver price is now as we amended stream which is now on better terms in the current silver price environment and now as the pea is out is there a production restart decision that’s can be made in the very short term or is there anything else that you are going to waiting on clynton nauman so here is the plan we are going to  we are going to move forward in a very systematic manner we are dealing with extremely high grade ore underground and so the plan is to drive a decline at bermingham get down closer to that ore and untaken underground exploration and infill program of that  meters as brad mentioned from that and following that we will drive  we will drive a decline into flame  moth will be the same thing there maybe not to the same extent because we have  we have got that’s a bigger thicker more consistent ore not as high grade as bermingham therefore not requiring the same amount effort and it will be as a result of those programs that will lift the entire project to a prefeasibility level and from there we’ll make a decision to move to production but i can assure you that that we have eyes firmly fixed on the price here which is to put this district back into production with what is going to be the bestinclass silver project i think in the same thing mike kozak okay and then just i think the initial capital for restart i think you said cad million i guess cad million in cash now and no debt how are you thinking  are you thinking about some sort of like revolving credit facility or what kind of projects orienting package would you be looking for clynton nauman quite frankly mike i mean we don’t feel pressure at all we’ve got plenty of cash this entire project is not going to be a cash consumer immediately it’s going to take place over a period of time i think we have some very important strategic investors and so we are not  at this point we’re simply not addressing that question also don’t forget that we have those warrants sitting out there themselves could be quite valuable mike kozak and then just two one or quick one the total capex number for the life of the project is that include all the capitalized exploration clynton nauman no it does not include the capitalized exploration to service exploration does not mike kozak okay and then also on  just on the recoveries particularly on the lead and zinc theyre way way up in this new pea is that purely due to the higher resource grade or is there something else that’s going on there brad thrall yes mike this is brad what you see again going forward the difference with flame  moth bermingham lucky queen has got a different lead to silver ratio so we’ve undertaken a number of recovery flotation tests over the last couple of years including from flame bermingham and lucky queen and it’s very consistent in that   lead kind of recovery so again because of the lower lead grades we have for very high concentrates  or  grams per ton of silver is concentrate so it’s primarily again related to these different ratios as we move forward operator and well now take our next question from mike niehueser with scarsdale equities mike niehueser it looks like  i guess the kind of the stunning thing with the pea and the amendment of agreement it seems like it really drastically changes the profile of the projects and district from when you started production at bellekeno grades are up mine life is longer capital costs are lower expansion potential is really there it just seems to be  this doesn’t seem to come across in the release what a huge change this is the plus for the project probably the biggest thing is just the derisking of it it doesn’t seem like you’re going to have the bottlenecks and you’re going to be able to meet your production requirement pretty soon can you give expand on that clynton nauman i dont know about expand on that mike you’ve done a pretty job there i would say that we  there are lots of things that we could have done with this news release but in our decision was to remain pretty pragmatic stick to the facts and just simply light out like it is i mean i think the numbers and the commentary speaks for themselves and that sort of the way that we have approached it and yes from my  in my view we are definitely starting down the track of rebranding the company and once again i repeat that i just think that this is a bestinclass project and its just a matter of moving systematically forward with it and making the decisions as they come to us so thats the way i feel about it mike niehueser well it looks like a lot of the big catalyst type of venture going to get pushed as a latter part of this year with getting drill results could you walk through the timeline for  as far as  because i know that you have to permit the birmingham decline you have got some changes it sounds like with the decline at the flame  moth you have got the water license could you just go through that just a little slower so we might be able to see what we could look forward to happen in  because it seems like youre going to finish the year with the much different more higher visibility on the project overall but it just seems like there is a lot going on with permitting declines drilling underground drilling and other things clynton nauman yes for sure there is a lot of moving parts here but the primary things that they will be dealing with  firstly they get this birmingham decline permitted and we are already in that process and everything goes according to plan and i would flag the fact that permitting in the yukon is not nearly a certain as it used to be that  but we were hoping that and we are going to have the appropriate authorization in place by july or so of this year and they will launch off on driving that decline in august  that’s about five month effort to drive that decline and once it gets down about  to  meters we will install a drilling platform and we will start that underground drilling that underground drilling will take two to three months nominally but at the same time as we are doing that and not having major decision yet but we thought would that we would simply take those development crews move them over the flame  moth and start driving that imply and that would take us into the middle of  meantime you are drilling in birmingham be complete we probably will stop for a month or so at flame  moth just to get the additional infield and undercut drilling that needs to get done and be in a position to put buzz of these deposits in production in the third or fourth quarter  that’s a lot of stuff but ill tell you that if silver prices increase dramatically then we do have the alternative of accelerating that entire program such that essentially those deep mines will be driven together and going forward on that basis so i am not sure if that answers your question but that’s sort of whats in back of our heads mike niehueser well it seems like there is a pretty  there is a huge opportunity i don’t know what the probability is its always subject exploration risk but once you could underground both the flame  moth and the bermingham how much excitement do you think is going to come from the infill or how many surprises or where do you see the opportunity for surprise for deeper flame  moth and deeper or laterally at bermingham clynton nauman well these are very robust systems clearly with this amount of silver so yes i mean it’s a  it was bellekeno then we’ll just have to see what comes out of it but the bermingham deposit is open at depth the flame  moth not so much when exploration perspective starting up because the deeper signs of flame  moth want to be tested until we get several years into the mine plant and i will tell you that that we are focused and this entire plant is driven around looking at the first couple of years couple of three years of production at bermingham and flame  moth where there is significant opportunity we feel so that’s the way that we are proceeding mike niehueser well also regarding the amendment to the agreement at  i mean the market likes higher rates higher grades but it seems like there is a real protection from flexibility to be to keep from having a high grade to mine to say is the business and your ability to pick out lower grade pause that might be sterilized it seems to make this a much more flexible longlasting aligned agreement with both the interest at silver wheaton and alexco clynton nauman yes and that’s exactly the basis that the discussion was undertaken with silver wheaton looking at discoveries and resources like bermingham which is a relatively large resource in the  gram range with the smaller areas of very high grade and the interest of both silver wheaton and alexco and figuring out how you design a mine to optimize efficiency within that type of silver mineralization environment so this meets that purpose and i cannot understate how important that is in terms of planning and opportunity at keno hill and it also extends to the exploration front in that indiscernible potential production at keno hill does not have to achieve  gram  gram type levels to qualify to be included in the mine plant mike niehueser well also as brad mentioned the metallurgy and that is compatible with the flame  moth in bermingham but you’re adding another ball mill is that intended to optimize or is that partially because of that you’re going to blending ore or having different ore coming from different mine brad thrall yes mike this is brad yes that’s really to ensure that we’ve got upgrading capacity for the life of mine production rate of the  tons per day so again the mill operated very well and we had peak production of  tons per day or so so it’s just relative to ensure that we’ve got an upgrading capacity mike niehueser okay and on the earlier question you mentioned you didn’t have any plans to raise additional capital but it seems like you mentioned on prior calls over the years that the quality of your concentrated high enough that it’s really valued by smelters and i’m just curious if any smelters are coming to you with money modest amounts of money we should be sufficient and get to that where you need to be clynton nauman yes that’s a good point mike and we do need to put move on here i can see people in the queue so yes this is a premium product in the market make sure and it’s no surprise that it will has attractive the attention on various smelters around the world operator and we’ll now take our next question from john tumazos with john tumazos very independent research john tumazos thank you when you ramp up in the second half of  to produce full year  roughly how many tons of that you expect to be doing and ballpark range what would be ounces of silver will be clynton nauman john yes so it’s starting out year you hit pretty quickly claim up towards that kilogram type range and so your initial annualized production over the first two to three years which weve published is around  million ounces per year but i can tell you that in that year that you’re talking about your numbers between  million and  million ounces operator and we’ll now take our next question from robert indiscernible capital unidentified participant yes i have one question for you what is your  how could you expand production of ton per day production with what you’re anticipating now from a way since youve got a plan or some sort of formulate site that you could expand your tons per day production clynt nauman yes thanks for the question i will say that one of the exercise that we have through here was figuring out how sort of optimize throughput for this mill there are a lot of tons available that’s true and certainly tons that are above cut off that are not included in this particular plan and then flipside of that is the mill itself the mill has a designed nameplate capacity of  tons per day and i think that our objective is to just to get up there see what we can do in terms of optimizing that and increasing throughput but yes there is lots of upside too to increasing the production at keno hill but you need to keep in mind that and then in doing that we’ll need to go back through the permitting process or significantly expanded production operator and we’ll now take our next question from mike niehueser with scarsdale equities mike niehueser yes well brad is there can you talk about the plants to grow aeg in the next year or is this pretty much a lot of desperate that you’re doing in regards to in permitting regards to the longterm plant for the district brad thrall well see mike and certainly there is going to be a lot of focus on keno hill in terms of executing this plant but certainly one of the growth aspects of aeg is keno hill itself i mean what we call the esm reclamation plan this is the closure plan for the district i mean that really is reaching a milestone now where we are now entering the permitting process for that so really keno hill not only offers growth for alexco in the mining side but it really is the next catalyst for the environmental side of the business as we move in this engineering and execution phase over the next couple of years of permitting and funding from the government of canada so that’s like really really i think one of the bigger growth catalyst for aeg itself as keno hill mike niehueser and i haven’t heard of the schwartzwalder plant is that related to the gold king project that you went in too or is that somewhere else clynton nauman yes those are separate mike the schwartzwalder project is just outside of golden colorado so that’s a contract that we have to operate a couple of water treatment plants and again that suffered obviously from the gold king plant down in southern colorado near silverton which we continue and operate that plant on behalf of the epa mike niehueser is that the one youve been doing for a number of years now clynton nauman we are going on a yard our second full year here at gold king again our contract was just extended for another full year there so we are certainly going to be there for the longer term mike niehueser well its turning out to be a longer term contract than you originally anticipated clynton nauman yes that’s right mike the original contract was just a  was built in  days and operate and commission it and thats turned into couple of extensions to the longer term operating agreement mike niehueser and clynt could you talk about mcquesten for a second it seems like when we looked at that in the past it was basically gold not silver it was little bit lower grade but the fact that this is an option can you talk about the potential of banyan and whether that is interest in or is just a natural evolution of optimizing keno hill clynton nauman yes it’s the ladder mike we have a huge land position at keno hill we have a list of exploration targets now that we sort of understand what it is that what kind of geological circumstances give rise to these higher grade resources and mcquesten down the very west end of our landholding is a gold target and well that would be on our list to a long ways down our list and the opportunity to be able to put the mcquesten property together with victorias orex property to consolidate that gold target was quite an opportunity and that’s why we invested in banyan with the  at the same time as theyre optioning the property from us and so we will maintain and interest in whats going on that part of the district so it’s a scam related gold target at the outset and it will be very interesting to see how it evolves there mike niehueser and i guess lastly you mentioned the prefeasibility study and i think the earlier bellekeno went into the operation on and silver wheaton went along with only the pea is that a significantly higher level of engineering and other types of resource definition work than it was completed earlier or is it just the natural evolution of having to do higher level study clynton nauman yes i mean its  there is  i just have to repeat that this especially bermingham is an extremely high grade deposit and its underground and so closing down the drill spacing to  meters or less is something that youd normally do with this type of a deposit it’s not quite the same as bellkeno and for that reason we will go through the progression prefeasibility level reviews and studies prior to finalizing mine designing and moving forward so yes it is a higher level of confidence and confirmation and it’s absolutely required in my view and dealing with these types of deposits mike niehueser and just lastly just to comment this seems like yukon is really starting to heat up again after the downturn and with the big companies moving in and so forth i hope that the permitting regime really grabs the bull by the horns because there is a real opportunity for the area and that’s all i got clynton nauman okay thanks mike appreciate the comments operator operator instructions and it appears there are no further questions in the queue at this time and mr clynton nauman i’d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks clynton nauman thank you and thank you for joining us again today we see publication of the pea and amended silver purchase agreement with silver wheaton is the first step to move keno hill back to production as we’ve been discussing here we are planning a busy year most importantly driving the bermingham advanced exploration deep line initiating an underground infill and exploration drill program continuing surface exploration but we’re also collecting additional information from various deposits to support a prefeasibility level study which is a next step on the road to a final production decision at keno hill as always we appreciate your support and interest in alexco and with that i will turn it back to mike to close the call michael clark you’ve been listening to the alexco resource corp december   fourth quarter and year end conference call we
