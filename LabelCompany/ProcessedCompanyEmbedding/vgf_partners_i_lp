flexibility for mobile and stationary applications ge launches new waukesha vgf gas engines with advanced controls giving operators greater flexibility for mobile and stationary applications october   ge offers vgf units with advanced controls as standard feature for compact horsepower segment giving operators greater emissions reduction and other capabilitiesadvanced controls enhance operator ability to reduce engine emissions during gas compression mechanical drive and onsite power for oil and gas productionnew units extend maintenance intervals and lower operating expenses dallas—october  —ge’s distributed power business nyse ge today announced the introduction of its new waukesha vgf highspeed gas engine models that for the first time combine the company’s proven compact gas engine design with advanced controls normally used in ge’s larger waukesha units offering advanced controls and aftertreatment capabilities as standard features the vgf units give operators greater flexibility for onsite power airgas compression and drilling applications for oil and gas production compared to other engines available in the  horsepower highspeed range the vgf is adapting the controls and emissions reduction technologies from ge’s larger waukesha vhp engine the industry workhorse for gas compression and oilfield power generation previously used only for stationary applications before the upgrades the new fse and hse vgf models will be available with epa nonroad mobile certification for air quality allowing the units to also be deployed for mobile applications the certification on the engine also includes coverage for certain stationary applications “our new waukesha vgf gas engines from ge offer greater flexibility and added value for operators to deploy our engines in difficult applications and high altitudes” said wouterjan van der wurff general manager for gas engines up to  megawatts mw for ge’s distributed power business until now engine packagers would buy the engine from ge or another supplier and then the threeway catalyst and airfuel ratio control systems from other suppliers but with the introduction of ge’s new waukesha vgf models with the empact product offering ge is offering packagers and end users a more beneficial “onestop shop“ for the gas engine controls and aftertreatment systems in addition to the advanced controls ge’s two new waukesha vgf models offer improved oil filtration for a healthier engine as well as improved oil cooling capabilities allowing the unit to operate in even hotter ambient conditions additional enhancements include extending the life cycle of the cylinder heads a new closed crankcase breathing system and a new highaltitude turbocharger coupled with a watercooled wastegate these engine improvements also will be offered to operators of existing vgf units in the field the new vgf models‘ topend maintenance intervals have been extended  percent which is a significant upgrade over the existing gsi engine and a  percent longer interval than competing engines the major overhaul interval also is twice as long as offered by other engines longer intervals translate into less downtime and higher package availability finally when it comes to servicing the internal components the vgf is the only engine in its class that offers full access at the job site the units also will operate for  hours without an oil filter and spark plug change compared to  hours required by other engines this is a key advantage over existing systems because it meets or exceeds epa neshap maintenance guidelines the new vgf fse and hse engines with advanced controls already have been deployed for a half dozen successful us demonstration projects to prove their advantages over existing engines including projects in stationary gas compression and power generation as well as mobile power generation and airgas compression the new engines will be commercially available in the first quarter of  the new units were announced during the  high horsepower hhp summit at the kay bailey hutchison convention center in dallas for more information please visit ge’s

drive has some bad sectors on it causing it to crash if the device shows up as a drive on your computer you can do a scan disk with repair on it the slow one to look for bad sectors if youre adventurous you can try replacing the drive with an ssd at least that way youll not get a hard drive head crash ever again assuming the device might have suffered from a head crash    report
