we are a latestage specialty pharmaceutical company initially focused on developing our clinically validated and patentprotected plxguard delivery system to provide safer and more effective aspirin products our plxguard delivery system works by releasing active pharmaceutical ingredients into the duodenum the first part of the small intestine immediately below the stomach rather than in the stomach itself we believe this improves the absorption of many drugs currently on the market or in development and reduces acute gastrointestinal gi side effects—including erosions ulcers and bleeding — associated with aspirin and ibuprofen and potentially other drugs our us food and drug administration fda approved lead product aspertec  mg is a novel formulation of aspirin that uses the plxguard delivery system to significantly reduce acute gi side effects while providing superior antiplatelet effectiveness for cardiovascular disease prevention as compared with the current standard of care enteric coated aspirin a companion  mg dose of the same novel formulation — aspertec  mg —is in latestage development and will be the subject of a supplemental new drug application snda leveraging the already approved status of aspertec  mg our commercialization strategy will target both the overthecounter otc and prescription markets taking advantage of the existing otc distribution channels for aspirin while leveraging the fda approval of aspertec  mg and expected approval for aspertec  mg for otc and prescription use when recommended by physicians for cardiovascular disease treatment and prevention given our clinical demonstration of better antiplatelet efficacy as compared with enteric coated aspirin and better acute gi safety we intend to use a physiciandirected sales force to inform physicians—and by extension consumers—about our product’s clinical results in an effort to command both greater market share and a higher price for our superior aspirin product our product pipeline also includes other oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids using the plxguard delivery system that may be developed including a clinicalstage gisafer ibuprofen — pl ibuprofen  mg —
