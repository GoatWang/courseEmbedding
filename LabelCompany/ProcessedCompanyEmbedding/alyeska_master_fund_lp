one or more of our advertisers we may receive compensation when you click on links to those products for an explanation of our advertising policy visit this page not many people have an airline they love but almost everyone has one they hate from flight delays and cramped seats to bad customer service and lost luggage airlines have a terrible reputation in survey after survey the airline industry ranks somewhere below most insurance sectors and only slightly above the cable television industry airlines are to put it simply not exactly adored but is that reputation earned or is it just a perception perhaps an airline returned your suitcase two days late and missing three wheels so you vowed never to travel with them again but in any system where millions of passengers are transported on tens of thousands of flights each day in the us alone a few bad incidents are unavoidable so does your personal experience reflect the overall state of that particular airline or did you just get unlucky and catch it on a bad day we set out to answer this quandary — by looking at the numbers while most “best of” airline rankings rely on customer surveys or reader polls we wanted to study objective data is your airline really always late or only when you happen to arrive two hours early at the airport are the seats measurably terrible or do they just feel that way after six hours of fidgeting on them and most importantly is your airline really nickelanddiming you to death with unnecessary fees or are the costs offset by its competitively lower ticket prices to compile our report we assembled data from sources across the industry we scrutinized thousands of pages of government reports and corporate financial statements we chose criteria based on what we believe regular passengers care about most and if you disagree with our choices we’re even giving you the chance to reweight our criteria yourself in this post the candidates we adore international travel here at the points guy — meeting people from other cultures encourages a better understanding of humanity and of ourselves we encourage everyone to get out of their comfort zone and take a trip outside the us at least once and preferably often but we also know that less than half of all americans have a passport which means the majority of people will only experience air travel on flights within the united states therefore we elected to study domestic airlines — or in the case of large airlines to differentiate their domestic operations from their international ones we also wanted to restrict our study to airlines that most people would have a decent chance of flying there may be regional operators with excellent reputations but if their only route is nantucket to martha’s vineyard most americans are never going to experience that service so our report encompasses the ten largest airlines as measured by the number of domestic passengers and excluding regional carriers who partner with one or more of the airlines we were unable to include allegiant air in our study since it was not possible to obtain enough data to accurately rank the airline our list of contenders is as follows while alaska and virgin america have completed their merger transaction at this time they are still operating as two separate airlines so we kept them separate in our rankings the criteria it’s a wellknown truism of the airline industry that the overwhelming majority of flyers book airline tickets based on two factors — price and convenience so in developing our criteria —  themes across four major categories — we wanted to make sure those two factors got the greatest weight when it comes to price the actual cost of an airline ticket is now only a portion of the final cost for travelers given the explosion in ancillary fees in recent years we’re thinking about baggage and change fees in particular so we accounted for both airfare and fees in our calculations for convenience the more cities and routes an airline serves the more options a customer has for getting the shortest flight at the best time of day but the ontime arrival rate and the features of an airplane cabin — such as onboard wifi — are elements of convenience as well of course just because price and convenience are primary factors doesn’t mean we ignored the rest of what makes up an airline operation after much consideration we identified the following  criteria in four broad categories — price convenience headaches and extras — and weighted them as follows the methodology once we had our candidates and our criteria we set about finding ways to measure it all for some elements this was extremely straightforward statistics on lost baggage and involuntary bumps being denied boarding not turbulence are reported by the department of transportation dot on a monthly basis so in those cases it was just a matter of looking up the data other criteria were a little harder to find airlines don’t like to tell the general public how much we’re spending on airfare but they love telling investors how much money they’re collecting in fact there’s a standard measure in the industry known as “passenger yield per mile” that metric is calculated by dividing the amount of passenger revenue an airline has collected from tickets by the number of passengers and then again by the number of miles flown the final result tells investors how much an airline gets paid in cents per customer per mile for investors the higher this number the better but a higher number means passengers are paying more or to put it more simply passenger yield is how much you the customer are paying on average in airfare for each mile you fly passenger yield is reported by airlines on a quarterly basis to the bureau of transportation statistics bts which puts the info into an online public database called transtats that same database also contains legally required reports on baggage and change fees collected by each airline and the database can be filtered by domestic or worldwide performance so thanks to the bts we were able to assemble all the data we needed on price in just one place then came a few tricky items most people know the department of transportation also collects statistics for ontime arrivals but delayed flights and cancelled flights are two different animals fortunately a company called oag compiles an annual report known as the punctuality league which combines delays and cancellations for over  million flights worldwide to arrive at an overall “on time” figure for each airline customer satisfaction is by its nature a subjective judgment made by customers but customer complaints are an objective way to measure it the dot maintains records of the customer complaints it receives each month across a dozen topics including customer service flight problems and refunds it’s a selfselecting data set as it only reflects people who took the time to file a complaint with the dot but it’s an applestoapples comparison across all our airlines while it wasn’t difficult to count the number of lounges for each of our airlines by city and airport and determine the daily and annual cost to get into them calculating the size of each airline’s route network was a bit more complicated since most airlines report their number of cities routes and frequencies on a worldwide basis but oliver wyman planestats makes it easy to filter origin and destination od data from the bts by region which let us calculate the size of our airlines’ networks using domestic cities only finally there were the tough nuts to crack cabin comfort includes a ton of variables — seat size onboard food inflight wifi plus dozens of others that can be difficult to compress into one overall number for each flight let alone an entire airline however one company does exactly that the routehappy public database provides an overall rating on cabin comfort for any specific flight that meant it was up to us to decide which flights to search for in the end we chose to look up the average flight ratings for the  most traveled domestic routes on each of the  airlines which we then distilled into one overall score per airline for ranking purposes and how could a site called the points guy do an airline study without including frequent flyer programs given the breadth and complexity of mileage programs we could easily write an entire report about this one criterion alone and we might just do that at some point but to keep things simple we used our existing tpg monthly point valuations along with our tpg elite status valuations to arrive at an overall score for each airline’s loyalty program a few technical notes all data in this report is from calendar year  unless noted and was normalized for the number of passengers traveling on each airline we also restricted our data set to domestic numbers only except when separating the domestic data from the worldwide data was impossible raw data totals for each criteria were converted to a simple  to  scale with  at the top and  at the bottom since there are  airlines and  criteria a theoretically perfect airline would score  the results and now the moment we’ve all been waiting for… here are the  domestic airlines from best to worst the top and bottom of these rankings aren’t terribly surprising alaska is known to run a very good airline and it shows as the airline placed in the top  in more than half our criteria — airfare ontime arrivals lost baggage involuntary bumps customer satisfaction and its frequent flyer program the only real knock against alaska is the size of its route network but that problem will be partially alleviated as alaska’s merger with virgin america — which also ranked well in our survey based on airfare cabin comfort lost baggage and involuntary bumps — is implemented over the next few years if alaska can retain its high quality and incorporate virgin america’s strengths while expanding it’s going to be a fierce competitor on the other end of our rankings many folks don’t like spirit and it appears they have good reason to feel that way the lowcost carrier finished dead last in four different criteria — ontime arrivals customer satisfaction cabin comfort and its frequent flyer program — and second to last in another unsurprisingly its baggage and change fees the one thing spirit’s got going for it cheap airfares it led the pack in that area frontier suffered a similar fate as it was second to last in many of the same areas in which spirit finished last but finished second from the top when it comes to airfare but what about some of these other results united coming in second may surprise some people especially since the carrier didn’t win outright in any particular area however it performed solidly in a number of our criteria including route network cabin comfort baggage and change fees and lounges and didn’t finish worse than middle of the pack on any measure though it could use some improvement in customer satisfaction put it all together and united wins the silver this year the biggest shock to most people will likely be seeing delta in seventh place delta has built a reputation over the last several years for running an excellent airline operation and when we dive deeper into the numbers it’s clear that reputation is warranted delta finished in the top  in almost all the performance criteria including ontime arrivals customer satisfaction involuntary bumps lounges and the overall size of the airline so why did delta fare so poorly in the final rankings simple — it’s expensive delta finished last in the airfare criterion which meant lots of revenue for delta but less money in customers’ pockets and delta also charges significant fees as well while some other airlines offset their higher fares with lower ancillary fees southwest is an excellent example of an airline with low baggage and change fees although it has higher airfares than most people realize and no premium class seats which hurt its cabin comfort score finally jetblue hovered somewhere between the top and the middle of the pack as it scored well on baggage and change fees cabin comfort and customer satisfaction but received low marks for ontime arrivals and involuntary bumps american sits right in the middle of our rankings — it has the largest route network of any airline but got poor scores for customer satisfaction lost baggage and involuntary bumps and while hawaiian was the most ontime airline in our study it has the smallest route network relatively high airfares lounges in hawaii only partner lounges did not count for any airlines in our study and a middling frequent flyer program which relegated it to eighth place overall those are the facts but we also wanted to take a look at consumer survey results from market research company jd power whose  jd power north america airline satisfaction study is highly regarded when it comes to studying the opinions of airline customers the survey shows how customers perceived airlines in  but how do those perceptions stand up to our objective look at the data here’s a comparative look jd power does not include spirit hawaiian or virgin america in its survey it does include the canadian carriers westjet  and air canada  which are not shown for the purposes of this comparison courtesy jd power and associates when compared to our data united is ranked much lower by customers and southwest is regarded more highly but the rest of the airlines are within a couple of ranks across both studies it’s your turn but what if you don’t agree with us or with the average consumer perhaps you’re willing to pay more for better cabin comfort or you’ll fly on a less convenient airline if its frequent flyer program is superior everyone has different priorities and we wanted to give tpg readers a chance to draw their own conclusions so we’ve put together a tool that lets you decide how much to weight each of our  criteria pick your own percentages across the categories and the tool will recalculate the results based on your choices and our data for instance if you don’t care about baggage and change fees you can weight it less than the  we chose and emphasize something else with the extra percentage points or if frequent flyer programs are extremely important to you push that criteria up as far as you’d like… but remember that the overall percentages must add up to  so it’s up to you to pick and choose what you want prioritized and deprioritized

convenience customer satisfaction and perks like lounges and meaningful loyalty programs and while price means a lot to most people having the lowest fares does not make an airline great as demonstrated by the fact that the lowcostnofrills approach earned spirit and frontier the two bottom spots in our study it will be interesting to see if the legacy carriers — united american and delta — will benefit from their ongoing focus on improving premium cabins while squeezing more and more out of their economy passengers with smaller seats and stripped down “basic economy” fares at the same time can southwest continue to thrive off its reputation as a small lowfare airline when it’s actually become the largest domestic carrier by passengers with airfares similar to the big  and successfully combining two different airline operations and cultures is extremely tricky — will alaska and virgin america avoid the pitfalls that have plagued airline mergers in the past who knows what the future will bring but our study shows just how the  biggest us airlines differ in terms of what they offer today and now with these tools and data you can pinpoint exactly which airline

the fund’s summary employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the

way to invest in the investment universe a different class of investment are managed futures   commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum

one or more of our advertisers we may receive compensation when you click on links to those products for an explanation of our advertising policy visit this page not many people have an airline they love but almost everyone has one they hate from flight delays and cramped seats to bad customer service and lost luggage airlines have a terrible reputation in survey after survey the airline industry ranks somewhere below most insurance sectors and only slightly above the cable television industry airlines are to put it simply not exactly adored but is that reputation earned or is it just a perception perhaps an airline returned your suitcase two days late and missing three wheels so you vowed never to travel with them again but in any system where millions of passengers are transported on tens of thousands of flights each day in the us alone a few bad incidents are unavoidable so does your personal experience reflect the overall state of that particular airline or did you just get unlucky and catch it on a bad day we set out to answer this quandary — by looking at the numbers while most “best of” airline rankings rely on customer surveys or reader polls we wanted to study objective data is your airline really always late or only when you happen to arrive two hours early at the airport are the seats measurably terrible or do they just feel that way after six hours of fidgeting on them and most importantly is your airline really nickelanddiming you to death with unnecessary fees or are the costs offset by its competitively lower ticket prices to compile our report we assembled data from sources across the industry we scrutinized thousands of pages of government reports and corporate financial statements we chose criteria based on what we believe regular passengers care about most and if you disagree with our choices we’re even giving you the chance to reweight our criteria yourself in this post the candidates we adore international travel here at the points guy — meeting people from other cultures encourages a better understanding of humanity and of ourselves we encourage everyone to get out of their comfort zone and take a trip outside the us at least once and preferably often but we also know that less than half of all americans have a passport which means the majority of people will only experience air travel on flights within the united states therefore we elected to study domestic airlines — or in the case of large airlines to differentiate their domestic operations from their international ones we also wanted to restrict our study to airlines that most people would have a decent chance of flying there may be regional operators with excellent reputations but if their only route is nantucket to martha’s vineyard most americans are never going to experience that service so our report encompasses the ten largest airlines as measured by the number of domestic passengers and excluding regional carriers who partner with one or more of the airlines we were unable to include allegiant air in our study since it was not possible to obtain enough data to accurately rank the airline our list of contenders is as follows while alaska and virgin america have completed their merger transaction at this time they are still operating as two separate airlines so we kept them separate in our rankings the criteria it’s a wellknown truism of the airline industry that the overwhelming majority of flyers book airline tickets based on two factors — price and convenience so in developing our criteria —  themes across four major categories — we wanted to make sure those two factors got the greatest weight when it comes to price the actual cost of an airline ticket is now only a portion of the final cost for travelers given the explosion in ancillary fees in recent years we’re thinking about baggage and change fees in particular so we accounted for both airfare and fees in our calculations for convenience the more cities and routes an airline serves the more options a customer has for getting the shortest flight at the best time of day but the ontime arrival rate and the features of an airplane cabin — such as onboard wifi — are elements of convenience as well of course just because price and convenience are primary factors doesn’t mean we ignored the rest of what makes up an airline operation after much consideration we identified the following  criteria in four broad categories — price convenience headaches and extras — and weighted them as follows the methodology once we had our candidates and our criteria we set about finding ways to measure it all for some elements this was extremely straightforward statistics on lost baggage and involuntary bumps being denied boarding not turbulence are reported by the department of transportation dot on a monthly basis so in those cases it was just a matter of looking up the data other criteria were a little harder to find airlines don’t like to tell the general public how much we’re spending on airfare but they love telling investors how much money they’re collecting in fact there’s a standard measure in the industry known as “passenger yield per mile” that metric is calculated by dividing the amount of passenger revenue an airline has collected from tickets by the number of passengers and then again by the number of miles flown the final result tells investors how much an airline gets paid in cents per customer per mile for investors the higher this number the better but a higher number means passengers are paying more or to put it more simply passenger yield is how much you the customer are paying on average in airfare for each mile you fly passenger yield is reported by airlines on a quarterly basis to the bureau of transportation statistics bts which puts the info into an online public database called transtats that same database also contains legally required reports on baggage and change fees collected by each airline and the database can be filtered by domestic or worldwide performance so thanks to the bts we were able to assemble all the data we needed on price in just one place then came a few tricky items most people know the department of transportation also collects statistics for ontime arrivals but delayed flights and cancelled flights are two different animals fortunately a company called oag compiles an annual report known as the punctuality league which combines delays and cancellations for over  million flights worldwide to arrive at an overall “on time” figure for each airline customer satisfaction is by its nature a subjective judgment made by customers but customer complaints are an objective way to measure it the dot maintains records of the customer complaints it receives each month across a dozen topics including customer service flight problems and refunds it’s a selfselecting data set as it only reflects people who took the time to file a complaint with the dot but it’s an applestoapples comparison across all our airlines while it wasn’t difficult to count the number of lounges for each of our airlines by city and airport and determine the daily and annual cost to get into them calculating the size of each airline’s route network was a bit more complicated since most airlines report their number of cities routes and frequencies on a worldwide basis but oliver wyman planestats makes it easy to filter origin and destination od data from the bts by region which let us calculate the size of our airlines’ networks using domestic cities only finally there were the tough nuts to crack cabin comfort includes a ton of variables — seat size onboard food inflight wifi plus dozens of others that can be difficult to compress into one overall number for each flight let alone an entire airline however one company does exactly that the routehappy public database provides an overall rating on cabin comfort for any specific flight that meant it was up to us to decide which flights to search for in the end we chose to look up the average flight ratings for the  most traveled domestic routes on each of the  airlines which we then distilled into one overall score per airline for ranking purposes and how could a site called the points guy do an airline study without including frequent flyer programs given the breadth and complexity of mileage programs we could easily write an entire report about this one criterion alone and we might just do that at some point but to keep things simple we used our existing tpg monthly point valuations along with our tpg elite status valuations to arrive at an overall score for each airline’s loyalty program a few technical notes all data in this report is from calendar year  unless noted and was normalized for the number of passengers traveling on each airline we also restricted our data set to domestic numbers only except when separating the domestic data from the worldwide data was impossible raw data totals for each criteria were converted to a simple  to  scale with  at the top and  at the bottom since there are  airlines and  criteria a theoretically perfect airline would score  the results and now the moment we’ve all been waiting for… here are the  domestic airlines from best to worst the top and bottom of these rankings aren’t terribly surprising alaska is known to run a very good airline and it shows as the airline placed in the top  in more than half our criteria — airfare ontime arrivals lost baggage involuntary bumps customer satisfaction and its frequent flyer program the only real knock against alaska is the size of its route network but that problem will be partially alleviated as alaska’s merger with virgin america — which also ranked well in our survey based on airfare cabin comfort lost baggage and involuntary bumps — is implemented over the next few years if alaska can retain its high quality and incorporate virgin america’s strengths while expanding it’s going to be a fierce competitor on the other end of our rankings many folks don’t like spirit and it appears they have good reason to feel that way the lowcost carrier finished dead last in four different criteria — ontime arrivals customer satisfaction cabin comfort and its frequent flyer program — and second to last in another unsurprisingly its baggage and change fees the one thing spirit’s got going for it cheap airfares it led the pack in that area frontier suffered a similar fate as it was second to last in many of the same areas in which spirit finished last but finished second from the top when it comes to airfare but what about some of these other results united coming in second may surprise some people especially since the carrier didn’t win outright in any particular area however it performed solidly in a number of our criteria including route network cabin comfort baggage and change fees and lounges and didn’t finish worse than middle of the pack on any measure though it could use some improvement in customer satisfaction put it all together and united wins the silver this year the biggest shock to most people will likely be seeing delta in seventh place delta has built a reputation over the last several years for running an excellent airline operation and when we dive deeper into the numbers it’s clear that reputation is warranted delta finished in the top  in almost all the performance criteria including ontime arrivals customer satisfaction involuntary bumps lounges and the overall size of the airline so why did delta fare so poorly in the final rankings simple — it’s expensive delta finished last in the airfare criterion which meant lots of revenue for delta but less money in customers’ pockets and delta also charges significant fees as well while some other airlines offset their higher fares with lower ancillary fees southwest is an excellent example of an airline with low baggage and change fees although it has higher airfares than most people realize and no premium class seats which hurt its cabin comfort score finally jetblue hovered somewhere between the top and the middle of the pack as it scored well on baggage and change fees cabin comfort and customer satisfaction but received low marks for ontime arrivals and involuntary bumps american sits right in the middle of our rankings — it has the largest route network of any airline but got poor scores for customer satisfaction lost baggage and involuntary bumps and while hawaiian was the most ontime airline in our study it has the smallest route network relatively high airfares lounges in hawaii only partner lounges did not count for any airlines in our study and a middling frequent flyer program which relegated it to eighth place overall those are the facts but we also wanted to take a look at consumer survey results from market research company jd power whose  jd power north america airline satisfaction study is highly regarded when it comes to studying the opinions of airline customers the survey shows how customers perceived airlines in  but how do those perceptions stand up to our objective look at the data here’s a comparative look jd power does not include spirit hawaiian or virgin america in its survey it does include the canadian carriers westjet  and air canada  which are not shown for the purposes of this comparison courtesy jd power and associates when compared to our data united is ranked much lower by customers and southwest is regarded more highly but the rest of the airlines are within a couple of ranks across both studies it’s your turn but what if you don’t agree with us or with the average consumer perhaps you’re willing to pay more for better cabin comfort or you’ll fly on a less convenient airline if its frequent flyer program is superior everyone has different priorities and we wanted to give tpg readers a chance to draw their own conclusions so we’ve put together a tool that lets you decide how much to weight each of our  criteria pick your own percentages across the categories and the tool will recalculate the results based on your choices and our data for instance if you don’t care about baggage and change fees you can weight it less than the  we chose and emphasize something else with the extra percentage points or if frequent flyer programs are extremely important to you push that criteria up as far as you’d like… but remember that the overall percentages must add up to  so it’s up to you to pick and choose what you want prioritized and deprioritized

convenience customer satisfaction and perks like lounges and meaningful loyalty programs and while price means a lot to most people having the lowest fares does not make an airline great as demonstrated by the fact that the lowcostnofrills approach earned spirit and frontier the two bottom spots in our study it will be interesting to see if the legacy carriers — united american and delta — will benefit from their ongoing focus on improving premium cabins while squeezing more and more out of their economy passengers with smaller seats and stripped down “basic economy” fares at the same time can southwest continue to thrive off its reputation as a small lowfare airline when it’s actually become the largest domestic carrier by passengers with airfares similar to the big  and successfully combining two different airline operations and cultures is extremely tricky — will alaska and virgin america avoid the pitfalls that have plagued airline mergers in the past who knows what the future will bring but our study shows just how the  biggest us airlines differ in terms of what they offer today and now with these tools and data you can pinpoint exactly which airline really is best for you additional reporting by wallace cotton visualization tool designed by josh bricel frequent flyer valuations provided by nick ewen and peter rothbart featured image courtesy of
