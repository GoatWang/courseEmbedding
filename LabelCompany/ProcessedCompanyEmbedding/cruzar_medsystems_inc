medsystemsintroducing the houdini catheter guidewire advancement cruzar medsystemsintroducing the houdini catheter guidewire advancement cruzar medsystems introducing the houdini® catheter streamlining guidewire advancement for a more predictable process a remarkable advance for efficiency placement of the guidewire through vascular occlusions has always been a testament to your skill not the tools you have available it can be an unpredictable hurdle to getting down to real business until the wire is placed time stands still in the room now cruzar medsystems has developed a means of making guidewire placement more routine and efficient so that the procedure can continue the houdini catheter is a duallumen intravascular catheter intended for percutaneous use in the iliac femoral iliofemoral and popliteal arteries it faciltates guidewire advancement through challenging environments in a reliable efficient manner using a balloonactuated distal anchoring system coupled with a unique everting lumen with trueforwardtm technology this proprietary technology can give the operator a greater mechanical advantage at the tip of the guidewire even in the most discrete regions of the vasculature the result now the tool at your disposal can be more in line with your skill accommodates a standard commercially available ” – ” guidewire to access discrete regions of the peripheral vasculature trueforward™ technology grips the tip of the guidewire creating pressure that simulates “thumb and forefinger” control distal tip incorporates a radiopaque marker for visualization under fluoroscopy once accessed guidewires may be exchanged within the catheter everting distal lumen may reduce shear force when compared to standard catheters a reliable and predictable way to set the wire and move onto the procedure mp to webm converter by easyhtmlvideocom v click to watch dr lawrence garcias live houdini case at the  amp meeting the goto device to access the region set the guidewire and move on to the procedure in a reliable efficient manner the curvature of arteries combined with the distance from the entrance site to the target area greatly reduces the tip force of an unsupported guidewire   houdini’s balloonactuated distal anchoring system and the unique everting lumen with trueforwardtm technology may give the operator a greater mechanical advantage at the tip of the guidewire even in the most discreet regions of the vasculature the houdini catheter is located proximal to the targeted area a radiopaque marker at the tip provides visualization under fluoroscopy the balloon catheter is inflated to atm with radiopaque contrast media using a standard manual indeflator to anchor the catheter against the inner arterial wall once anchored internal pressurization is then transferred to the everting inner lumen the operator advances the guidewire by applying pressure to the plunger which connects to the base of the everting distal lumen this engages the trueforwardtm system and transfers the pressure applied by the operator to the distal lumen—not the vessel—enabling it to grip and stabilize the guidewire at the very tip the trueforwardtm system advances the guidewire with the unique rolling action of the everting distal lumen that delivers support to the guidewire this gripping action advances the guidewire forward with a focused tip force that simulates the action of holding the wire with your thumb and forefinger michael glennon president  ceo michael j glennon has been president and ceo of cruzar
