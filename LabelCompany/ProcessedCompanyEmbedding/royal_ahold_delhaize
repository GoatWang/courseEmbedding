over ahold delhaize  valuewalk misleading climate advertising causes eu legal liabilities ferrero wins nutella lawsuit over ahold delhaize by gabriel thoumi cfa frm on july    pm in politics sharetweetpin itsubmit as published by chain reaction research in june ferrero won an eu lawsuit in the belgian national court against delhaize delhaize had run an advertising campaign stating that nutella and other ferrero products contained palm oil regardless of ferrero’s sustainable palm oil and roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo commitments since  ferrero has purchased only ‘segregated’ rspocertified palm oil the term ‘segregated’ means that ferrero’s palm oil supply chain is kept separate throughout the supply chain from any other palm oil the court ruled that delhaize’s campaign ran afoul eu law against misleading advertising sipa  pixabay background – palm oil is big business palm oil is a staple of many consumer goods biofuels and plastic substitutes it is found in about half of all packaged products purchased by western consumers demand for palm oil has tripled over the past fifteen years in  global palm oil production was  million metric tons malaysia and indonesia produced  percent of global supply in  palm oil production was a usd  billion market oil palm trees yield about  to  metric tons of crude palm oil cpo and  metric tons of crude palm kernel oil pko per hectare ha per year because oil palm production achieves a higher yield than other oilseeds it is attractive for cultivation this has made it the most actively traded vegetable oil globally at the same time palm oil production is a key driver of both deforestation and peatlands clearance in indonesia and malaysia these activities have major negative impacts including greenhouse gas emissions public health risks human rights violations land grabbing and result in irreversible biodiversity loss chain reaction research estimates suggest that at least ten percent of indonesia’s land is under concession to palm oil estates which has resulted in about  percent of indonesia’s oil palm estate to be potentially a stranded asset due supply and demand constraints associated with deforestation regulations by governments and voluntary commitments by corporations voluntary corporate commitments companies have responded by working towards sustainable palm oil supply chains currently according to forest trends  companies globally have some type of public zerodeforestation commitment in fact the member companies of the the consumer goods forum has made a voluntary commitment to achieve zero net deforestation by  another example is the  new york declaration on forests in this declaration   companies committed to “at least halve the rate of loss of natural forests globally by  and strive to end natural forest loss by ” and “eliminate deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities such as palm oil soy paper and beef products by no later than ” standardizing sustainability terms within supply chain contracts the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo was established in  with the objective of promoting the growth and use of sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and engagement of stakeholders  percent of global production of palm oil is rspocertified in  rspocertified palm oil accounted for about  million ha  million metric tons or  percent of global palm oil production rspo has four certification systems these are identity preserved segregated mass balance and book  claim there are also other palm oil sustainability certification mechanisms such as the international sustainability  carbon certification iscc system the key is rspocertified palm oil trades overthecounter otc with the term sheet used for the contract between corporate buyer and seller referencing the specific sustainability criteria of the underlying transacted palm oil asset the commitments that are written into conditions for term sheets place corporations at risk for not achieving their sustainability goals for example in june unilever suspended purchasing crude palm oil from sawit sumbermas sarana ssms because this supplier violated unilever’s supply chain commitments in q  trade receivables to unilever oleochemicals indonesia amounted to idr  billion usd  million – a x increase over q  trade receivables with the suspension of this contract ssms lost a buyer that was equivalent to  percent of their  revenue in summary ssms actions could have put unilever at legal risk of their products subject claims of violating misleading advertising laws in the eu this is because ssms sold palm oil to unilever whose origin may have violated unilever’s sustainable palm oil sourcing policy –  eu legal risks misleading advertising directive and ucpd the eu has laws in place to prevent misleading advertisement by businesses companies making claims about their products’ main characteristics while supplying these products to consumers or traders in the eu should be aware that there is a legal risk if they do not comply with these claims this could include environmental and sustainability claims clientearth’s april  legal policy brief explains that depending on the specific circumstances of the case such companies could be held accountable under eu laws on misleading commercial practices in the eu the unfair commercial practices directive directive ec ucpd and the misleading advertising directive directive ec aim to protect consumers and traders against misleading advertising the ucpd prohibits misleading commercial practices that deceive or are likely to deceive the average consumer in relation to among other things the geographical origin of a product and are likely to influence consumers’ purchasing decisions according to the ucpd a company could violate the directive if its provides false information presents information about a product that is deceptive omits material information about a product andor fails to comply with a code of conduct by which the company has undertaken to be bound for example in  the market court of helsinki upheld a claim by a consumer ombudsman that a trader took advantage of the retail public when it “advertised the sale of bags of sweets by stating that for each bag sold it would plant one tree however the trader had already agreed to plant a certain number of trees independently from the number of candy bags sold” according to a brief by clientearth “ucpd guidance provided by the european commission specifies that clarity and accuracy of an environmental claim is key traders must present their environmental claims in a “specific accurate and unambiguous manner” and traders must be able to substantiate their factual claims with scientific evidence and provide it in an understandable way if challenged” this means that if a trader that has described their product as being compliant with a selfregulatory code it is important that the product actually is compliant with the selfregulatory code – such as the rspo noncompliance with a code of conduct could constitute a breach of the ucpd where the related claims are not merely aspirational but are firm and capable of being verified finally the ucpd states that certain practices are prohibited these prohibited practices are relevant to voluntary commitments falsely claiming to be a signatory of a code of conduct eg displaying that the company has signed up to a code of conduct relating to the product’s environmental credentials displaying a trust or quality mark without the necessary authorisation eg the rspo certification logo falsely claiming that a code of conduct has the endorsement of a public or other body claiming
