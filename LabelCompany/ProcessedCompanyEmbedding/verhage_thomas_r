following bills remarks we will open up the call to questions before i turn the call over to tom i need to review our safe harbor statement with you any statements in this call regarding our business that are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements and our future results could differ materially from the forwardlooking statements made today our actual results may be affected by many important factors including the risks and uncertainties identified in our press release and in our sec filings now id like to introduce tom verhage tom thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer well thanks rich and good morning everyone well as you saw in our press release late yesterday we are starting our fiscal  with a fine quarter thanks to our continued strong top line growth particularly outside of nafta stronger foreign currencies boosted our sales by  but just to give you a sense of the strength of our business globally yearoveryear sales increases in our three regions in local currency were a  in asia pacific  in europe middle east and africa and  in nafta as you know heavy truck build rates are down considerably in nafta which resulted in a  million yearoveryear decrease in sales to that portion of the market bill will comment on global market conditions across our major product lines in just a few minutes our operating margin for the quarter was  compared to  last year as you know we target a minimum operating margin of  for the year gross margin of  compares favorably to  last year and operating expenses of  are up a bit from last years rate of  the operating expense ratio was impacted by investments to capture growth opportunities and the higher mix of industrial segment sales which generally have both higher gross margins and operating expenses than engine segment sales our gross margin and operating expense ratio will fluctuate each quarter and be impacted by factors such as product mix investments in new product development and various other factors our tax rate of  for the quarter compares to a prior year rate of  in our yearend webcast we mentioned that our first quarter tax rate would be lower than our annual projected rate due to a lower tax rate that was signed into law in germany that allowed us to reduce our german deferred tax liabilities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain matters that were previously reserved now i would like to provide you with some further detail on a few matters for you to consider in your analysis for the remainder of  we have not changed our annual margin outlook which is for gross margin to exceed  and operating expense to be in the  range if we achieve these targets our operating margin should be at a minimum of  we expect the operating income to grow by  to  this year compared to last years  million interest expense should increase by  million to  million with the primary driver being the full year of debt related to our acquisition of afs this past march our tax rate will continue to fluctuate by quarter and we are maintaining our annual guidance of  to  you are all probably aware that we have adopted a new income tax accounting rules required by fin  in fiscal  and this new rule did not have a significant impact on our first quarter financial statements our capex outlook is in the range of  million to  million and we expect depreciation and amortization in a range of  million to  million which includes  million of amortization related to the intangible assets of the afs acquisition and we are maintaining our free cash flow outlook for the year of a range of  million to  million as you consider your quarterly earnings estimates for the remainder of the year we want to remind you that our second quarter is impacted by the significant number of holidays which results in more days that both our customers and our plants are closed making this our weakest sales quarter of the year also due to the timing of our annual stock option grants approximately  or  million to  million of our annual stock option expense is recorded in the second quarter one another reminder is that last year contained an extra week of domestic sales in our fourth quarter which provided a onetime boost of approximately  million so thanks primarily to our robust sales growth in the first quarter we have increased our eps outlook for the year to a range of  to  and with that ill pass it over to bill who will provide more background on our outlook bill william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tom and good morning everyone our first quarter results proved again the power of our diversified portfolio of filter businesses around the world so although we saw some weaker end markets in nafta including onroad heavy truck and residential construction these were balanced by a strong growth in europe and asia in both our engine and industrial business segments and in addition with our strong international presence we benefited from the weaker dollar now id like to briefly cover some highlights by segments and i will start with our engine business in europe in europe our offroad and onroad businesses both grew over  and our engine aftermarket grew by more than  in the quarter european business conditions for us continued to be good due to the combination of general economic growth together with new business we won at both existing and new customers and with our aftermarket growth in the european emerging markets which we include eastern europe middle east and north africa this has been a priority for us as weve had more distributors throughout these developing regions in asia our engine offroad and aftermarket businesses also had a strong quarter the strength was seen across the region japan we saw continued strong construction market in china we added new offroad customers and increased our aftermarket distribution and in australia we saw good growth as a result of the mining boom now switching to nafta as expected our nafta engine businesses were mixture of different stories this quarter in offroad the small construction market and our sales to it remained weak due to the much publicized residential housing crisis however this was offset by the ag equipment sector which was strong by which was fueled by strong farm and crop conditions our aerospace and defense sales were up on strong military demand particularly for filters for the new mrap vehicles and replacement parts for existing military equipment that needs overhauling in addition our acquisition last year of afs also added about  million to quarter one sales in our replacement parts our aftermarket business truck ton miles in nafta moderated as the economy has slowed and general equipment utilization rates are mixed better for large equipment in ag but slower or less for small construction equipment resulting in a good quarter for aftermarket which ended up  and finally the heavy truck downturn was about what we expected our nafta onroad sales were down  following last years big  buy in front of the january  new emission regulations now im going to switch to our industrial businesses and ill start with our industrial filtration solution business which had a great quarter internationally up  in both asia and europe in asia our sales in china were very strong reflecting the continued strong manufacturing investment climate there in europe we also benefited from the continued capital investment across the continent as western europe continued adding capacity and eastern and central europe continue to make new investments and in nafta our sales were up  as we continued to see good demand for both our systems and replacement filters in our gas turbine business we started the year very strong but i should remind everyone that these are typically large systems in fact the largest we make and the result our shipments to our customers by quarter are volatile and tend to bounce around a bit but overall the gas turbine market we serve continues to enjoy a strong up cycle in both the power generation and oil and gas markets and then finally our special application sales were good in quarter one as we saw solid growth in both our disk drive filter and ptfe membranes businesses now switching to our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year its good for fiscal  as noted in our press release we have just increased our full year sales expectations for both business segments earnings and business sales are now expected to be up between  to  up from our previous forecast of  to  and our industrial business segment should be up between  and  and we previously forecast that to be up between  and  so we picked up both of our forecast for both the engine and industrial sides of our company now many of you may be thinking after an  revenue increase in quarter one why our full year numbers arent higher so let me briefly explain during quarter one we did receive a benefit on the revenue line of about  due to foreign exchange as tom mentioned and we dont expect to see a similar size benefit during the second half of this year second reason is as i mentioned our gts shipments by nature bounce around by quarter we had an outstanding quarter one but we dont forecast the next several quarters to be quite as large and then third remember we had a strong second half last year with our first  million quarter in the fourth so our comps would be getting tougher but having said that we are looking at another good revenue year with total sales up approximately  and our first  billion sales year ever now looking at the outlook conditions by segment starting first with our engine business despite some current weakness in nafta both the construction and mining equipment sales continue to grow internationally in the ag equipment sector we see strong growth there globally the latest reports forecast both good crop prices and farmer incomes to be up which is positive for the ag equipment market we expect demand to continue growing in out aerospace and defense business and in addition last marchs acquisition of afs will continue to benefit our sales line we expect our aftermarket sales to continue to grow strong internationally as we focus on continuing to develop new markets and adding distribution and finally as tom mentioned we continue to see the nafta truck business being down about  million to  million this year through our third quarter before starting to pick up in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in our industrial businesses we see all of the major business groups up in fiscal  in ifs which includes our industrial dust collectors and compressed air filters incoming orders remain good for both equipment and replacement filters so we have increased our sales growth guidance up  to  for fiscal  in our gts business we have significant orders in hand already for fiscal  and were expecting a   to  sales growth for the full year as we continue to see good conditions in the middle east asia and parts of africa and finally were expecting  to  revenue growth in our special application business this year as tom mentioned we expect our fiscal  operating margin to be a minimum of  we have now increased our full year eps to that range and expect eps to be between  and  per share and which would be our th consecutive year of record earnings now as our habit i want to give you an update on two of the new platforms that we have talked about one is powercore and the other one is the diesel emissions and ill start first with powercore we have now won  equipment platforms with our oem customers  of these are already in production and another dozen are expected to go into production during the fiscal  our sales our powercore sales in the first quarter were up  to  million and we still have another  plus platforms in the proposal stage with our oem customers so with our current win rate of over  we are confident of the continued growth of powercore technology then finally we will be releasing our next generation powercore technology in  which utilizes the latest advances in donaldson technology which will allow us to further reduce the footprint of the filtration systems by about onethird switching to emissions while we continue to be positive regarding our longterm participation in the diesel emissions market we have now reduced our estimate for our onroad business to  million by the end of  so why make this adjustment well based on our current expectations of platform wins for  coupled with current volume projections for those wins we feel that  million is our best estimate today in addition we believe that it will take approximately  years from the implementation of the  epa regulations the industry market volumes to recover to normal production levels we will continue to support our existing onroad emission customers while we increase our focus to the retrofit offroad market which we now believe are better fit for our product development skills so the bottom line around this emissions opportunity is that we continue to see the onroad and offroad diesel emissions as a good growth opportunity for donaldson although not quite as large as we had first hoped now i want to offer some wrap up comments on the quarter we are off to a very good start in fiscal  with strong sales a new record and a  operating margin our overall sales outlook for fiscal  is good for both the engine segment and the industrial segment the strength of our business model which is a portfolio of diversified filtration businesses around the globe continues to work as the weakness in those end markets in the midst of cyclical downturns like heavy truck has been and will be offset this year by the strength in our industrial businesses globally and our international engine business in addition in this period of continuous improvement we have been remained focused on improving the longterm profitability of our business as tom reported we made good progress this quarter specifically one of the areas of immediate focus for us is that we will be continuing to improve our distribution efficiencies by investing in people processes and systems to yield a longterm sustainable improvement the bottom line with all this is that we expect to deliver another record year of sales and earnings making fiscal  our th consecutive eps record tina that concludes our prepared remarks now wed like to open it up to questions question and answer operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of charlie brady with bmo capital market charles brady  bmo capital markets hi thanks good morning guys william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning charlie charles brady  bmo capital markets hey a great quarter by the way in your gas turbine business and i know its lumpy but its clear the expectation for that business relative to where you were at the end of the year youve really ratcheted that it up a lot i am just wondering is that just being driven by a more near term influx of customer orders that have come in or projects that may be were in the pipeline that were possible but a little more uncertainty now that the uncertainty there has increased such that is always coming over much more highly probable i mean the outlook for that business is up significantly from where you previously thought it was going to be william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer charlie this is bill its mostly around i think the second point which is orders firming up so we can see the projects but always see now as the orders firming up so thats why weve increased our guidance charles brady  bmo capital markets okay and switching gears on special applications business how much of that business is disk drive business now thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer charlie this is tom approximately twothirds of that business is disk drive charles brady  bmo capital markets okay i mean the performance in the ag business in the quarter was also pretty strong and i am just wondering given the strength in q why the rest of the year if you had all together why the overall year performance wouldnt be little bit even stronger than kind of what you are projecting right now william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer charlie this is bill i think we dont have a tremendous amount of visibility in the described business so what we must rely on is sort of industry estimates of hard described shipments and thats what we factored into our guidance charles brady  bmo capital markets okay thanks ill get back in the queue william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of brian drab of william blair brian drab  william blair hi good morning william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning brian brian drab  william blair first question just around working capital looks like there is a slight up tick in accounts receivable and inventory days wondering if you could just talk a little bit about that thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer hey brian this is tom receivables are up actually quite a bit less than sales i think receivables increased in the first quarter about  and as you know our sales growth was up  to  so we are fairly comfortable with where the receivables are id say also on receivables as you know a lot of our sales growth took place overseas and generally overseas customers get longer terms than domestic customers i mean on inventories inventories were up by i believe about  keep in mind that about half of thats currency with the stronger currencies brian drab  william blair right thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer and then consistent with our growing aftermarket model and having enough inventory and distribution centers to supply our customers as they need them that would be another reason why inventories are up a bit brian drab  william blair okay and then thanks for the update on powercore wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamic competitive dynamic between powercore and channel flowing how you are seeing that develop william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer brain this is bill i think as weve talked about this the last couple of years we knew or expected that if powercore was successful other people would try and copy it and so may be in the spirit of imitation being the most sincere form of flattery other people are trying to copy it brian drab  william blair right william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer thats absolutely why we had started a couple of years working on the next generation and why we are going to be releasing this year so we are going to raise the bar again with the next generation powercore for our customers improve value in a smaller size thats the way we are dealing with that so we do see competitors trying to copy our first generation technology we are going to release the next generation brian drab  william blair okay great thank you operator your next question comes from line of richard eastman with robert w baird richard c eastman  robert w baird good morning william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning rick richard c eastman  robert w baird hey bill i just want to clarify the sales growth rates that you are providing the boost  and  for engine and  to  for industrial is that in local currency for the full year william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer thats in dollars rick richard c eastman  robert w baird okay so thats in reported dollars okay william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer right richard c eastman  robert w baird and then you had referenced the defense and aerospace business as part of the engine segment which i understand but could you give us could you size that for us how bigger piece do you talk to when you think of aerospace and defense and is that in the offroad piece or is that kind of the whole engine segment william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer rick it is in the offroad piece and in fact this is between  and  of our total sales richard c eastman  robert w baird okay and then the last thing is and i struggle with this just a little bit but the leverage in the business given the sales growth weve seen and i know you have made investments which may explain this but if i try to adjust the sales and op profit for currency impact my incremental op margin is around  and by your segment disclosure it would look like the greater incremental margin is coming out of the industrial business than the engine business and i am just struggling a little bit as to why are we intentionally absorbing some of that leverage with what i think is growth investments or why are we not showing a bit more incremental profit on the sales group thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer rick this is tom actually i anticipated your question richard c eastman  robert w baird i must ask you too much thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer i think you did notice yearoveryear that our industrial products margins did improve and thats going to fluctuate quartertoquarter last year as you might recall we were opening up a new plant in the czech republic for dust collectors and that had some plant startup cost and the like as far as growth investments there is no question we are going to continue to do that and i think thats paid for itself if you look at our growth in the first quarter we wouldnt have that growth if we wouldnt have made some of those growth investment so there is a lot of new product platforms coming out particularly on the engine side that we are investing in we are investing in sales and marketing both especially outside the united states so i think its primarily the growth opportunities that we see and we are just going to need to continue to make those investments richard c eastman  robert w baird okay and do you feel that exports up significantly for you or is again the international growth coming product is manufactured there but is the weaker dollar helped you in terms of exports william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer rick this is bill we do supply from our plants in the us outside of nafta but primarily most of what we sell outside of nafta we make in the region and that actually helps us in terms of being naturally hedged so from a weaker dollar perspective we havent seen a big gain because we export a lot richard c eastman  robert w baird yes i understand okay great thank you william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of scott graham with bears stearns scott r graham  bears stearns hey good morning william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning scott scott r graham  bears stearns couple of questions one on the margin one on the sales we were you indicated to us sort of during the middle two quarters of last year that you had this organizational spending to improve service rates to help out some of the newer facilities with logistics and what have you that number i think raced all the way up to as much as  million and i think always the second or third quarter of last year and then came off a bit in the fourth quarter i was just kind of wondering if you would may recall out that what that number was this quarter thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer scott this is tom i think what you are referring to is the third quarter last year when we did see that spike and identified the need to make some significant investments we had two projects key projects underway one was in belgium where we converted a manufacturing plant to a distribution center that project is pretty much behind us and now we are working on our distribution center in the united states on some important technology and process and organizational initiatives so that spending will continue for a bit yet and perhaps later on in the fiscal year well hope we start to see some of those benefits but thats going to be a longterm gain and we are going to see the benefits in the future scott r graham  bears stearns it doesnt though appears if it was as high this quarter as it was in that quarter that you indicated that was  million is that a fair statement thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer the  million back in the third quarter of last year included both of those distribution centers scott r graham  bears stearns yes thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer we are still incurring some extra expenses in the first quarter of this year and on a yearoveryear basis those extra expenses are approximately couple of million dollars scott r graham  bears stearns thank you on the sales growth  of your  segment sales growth were really terrific and i was just wondering  of them in particular offroad and aftermarket those sales looks like they accelerated this past quarter and maybe ive even lumped into that the ifs and i am just wondering if you could call out what other than strong international was it more of a new customers new distribution been to that and also the ifs being up  we had slower factory activity in united states and europe yet those sales were also were quite strong i was just maybe wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on offroad aftermarket and ifs william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer scott bill here first on the offroad i think there we are getting a benefit within that as we mentioned earlier in response to ricks question about that our defense business is often its small portion of that but its up alive its up for two reasons stronger sales to military customers and then the second is the inclusion of the afs acquisition which we didnt have this time a year ago so that helps but aside from that when we see very strong offroad conditions internationally and we also see very strong ag equipment conditions both in the us and internationally so its combination of those positive factors and offroad and more than offsetting what we see is some weakness in say residential construction equipment smaller construction equipment that some of our customers have talked about in their releases so the positives are more than offsetting that in the offroad in the aftermarket i think its to your point and as we discussed in our comments its around new distribution more proprietary products and expanding internationally its a combination of those factors we saw in the emerging markets in europe that i referenced we saw very significant growth as a result of those efforts and so thats a those are the types of things that are add up to good aftermarket growth globally and then the last one in ifs we see stronger growth there in asia and europe than we do in nafta although as i mentioned our nafta business was up but its up a lot more in asia and europe and we really havent seen what youve referenced a slow down in europe in that business so weve seen continued strength at least through the first quarter there as well scott r graham  bears stearns thats very helpful thank you william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer okay operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of eli lustgarten with longbow securities eli lustgarten  longbow research good morning william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning eli eli lustgarten  longbow research couple of quick just wanted to make sure i understood you said aerospace defense was  to  up total corporate sales or total engine sales thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer total corporate sales eli eli lustgarten  longbow research the corporate sales okay and you also indicated in the prepared remarks the  million of option expense in the second quarter thats coming do you have an idea what the share count change will look like over the year are you expecting to buyback most of the prebook whats going on with share count based on the options thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer yes eli im going to go back to history on the share count think you might be aware that we bought back on average about  of our shares per year over the last  years and thats resulted in a net reduction of  after the stock options and grants employee plans we really dont comment prospectively i think our press release indicated what we bought back in the  eli lustgarten  longbow research in the quarter yes thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer so what we do in the future will just depend on market conditions share price and  eli lustgarten  longbow research but the game plan hasnt changed to make sure that to continue the process of hopefully offsetting share base thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer yes over the longterm eli that would continue to be our plan eli lustgarten  longbow research okay and what percentage of your offroad business is north american residential construction rich sheffer  director of investor relations and assistant treasurer eli this is rich north america is about  of our offroad business william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer and you said residential eli lustgarten  longbow research yes how much of that is residential is the small step with the medium lot thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer we look at the mix within offroad  to  is related to construction less than half of that would be related to residential eli lustgarten  longbow research okay and the rest of it is mining and aerospace to tell you that how youre defining offroad thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer yes mining william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer and residential construction eli lustgarten  longbow research and average in that right william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer right eli lustgarten  longbow research same question in the aftermarket business what percentage is north american construction in the aftermarket business in engine william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer eli this is bill i dont think we break that out typically thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer yes the way we report off our aftermarket sales is a combination of both offroad and onroad replacement eli lustgarten  longbow research i realize that thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer yes if you look at north america aftermarket is about  to  of our total aftermarket so youre looking at a pretty small fraction once you get down to residential construction eli lustgarten  longbow research all right thank you william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator we have a follow up question from the charlie brady with bmo capital markets charles brady  bmo capital markets thanks if you could just get back to the diesel emission opportunity and sort of ratchet it down your expectation there was fairly significant down tick in your expectation can you just give a little more detail to what sort of played into that over the past i guess three months relative to where you were thinking before william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer charlie this is bill i think what we saw happen is the business started to be awarded for the next couple of years that we didnt win some of the platforms that we expected and so thats why we updated our guidance and provided we still think that thats a good growth opportunity its not going to be as large as we hoped on the onroad side but as there is growth opportunity there for us and we are still pursuing it and then in the next decade around the offroad regulations which come in  and  we think that there is going to be may be an opportunity that we are better suited to go after so were going to be a longterm player we just wanted to update the guidance based on what we see happening now charles brady  bmo capital markets are there still platforms yet to be awarded william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer for the onroad for  most of those have been awarded at this point charles brady  bmo capital markets when would you expect the offroad awards to start coming out william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer bill again here the offroad were probably over the next couple of say year to two years okay they are going to be at advance of the  so in   charles brady  bmo capital markets great thanks very much william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from the line of andrew deangelis ph with keybanc capital markets unidentified analyst hi guys william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning unidentified analyst my first question is a follow up from question asked earlier as it relates to powercore i was just wondering what percentage of the aftermarket you currently expect that youre capturing as it relates to powercore sales william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer which percentage systems that we put out there or we captured with our  unidentified analyst from an aftermarket perspective yes william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer the powercore systems that we put out there were capturing if not may be not a  but pretty darn close to  of the replacement parts for those systems unidentified analyst okay thats helpful and then i wanted to focus not specifically on your gts business i know you dont provide margin by unit but were just kind of curious as to the margin trajectory of that business over the last several quarters and what we can expect going forward thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer andrew this is tom you are right in your earlier comment we dont provide margin guidance by product line so i guess we wont be able to answer that question unidentified analyst i mean can you talk implicitly though as to what the margins in that unit have done over the last several quarters and what youd expect from the profile going forward rich sheffer  director of investor relations and assistant treasurer sure andrew this is rich i think what you are referring to is last year we had one or two issues with some large systems i think its safe to say since we didnt call anything out that we do not have recurrence of that this quarter that caused a down draft in the margins so i think things are operating fairly normally there unidentified analyst okay and then my last question relates to your transportation products group there is an ongoing share shift in the onroad segment in terms of the engine and i know your guidance hasnt changed in terms of the revenue growth profile that unit over fiscal  i was just wondering what part of that  million to  million fall off in the first three quarters is kind of related to the market and what the impact of the share shift in that segment of the business might have to plan to the expectations over the next  or  quarters william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer its essentially all market unidentified analyst okay william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer production volumes being down unidentified analyst so you are not seeing a notable impact from the ongoing share shift there in on the engine side william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer no unidentified analyst okay thats helpful thank you william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator at this time there are no further questions are there any closing remarks william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer yes tina thank you to all of you participating and listening i would like to thank you all for your time and interest to my fellow employees i want to thank you for your efforts and support in our achievement of another record quarter for both sales and earnings happy holidays and thank you all good bye operator thank you this concludes the donaldson companys first quarter fiscal  earnings conference call you may now disconnect copyright

before i turn the call over to tom i need to review our safe harbor statement with you any statements in this call regarding our business that are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements and our future results could differ materially from the forwardlooking statements made today our actual results may be affected by many important factors including risks and uncertainties identified in our press release and in our sec filings now id like to introduce tom verhage tom thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer well thanks rich and good morning everyone well as you saw in our press release late yesterday we reported both another quarter and our th consecutive year of record earnings thanks to the continued broadbased strength in our sales growth each of our three regions and nearly all of our major product lines contributed to our  sales growth with the impact of stronger foreign currencies being  as you will recall our fourth quarter sales last year included an extra week of sales in the us which increased prior year sales by  million looking at the remainder of the income statement we achieved our targeted  operating margin for the year just like we did last year for the fourth quarter our operating margin was  which is down from  last year this reduction is due to an increase in our operating expenses as a percent of sales the major drivers of this increase include our business mix in the fourth quarter information technology spending for our global customer support capabilities end cost for product development initiatives that include a fourth quarter reclassification of some expenses or some of these expenses from cost of sales to operating expenses for fiscal  were targeting operating expenses to once again be in the  range compared to  for fiscal  while operating expenses as a percent of sales increased in the quarter our gross margin percentage also increased the gross margin improvement is primarily due to the combination of higher production volumes cost reduction and control efforts planned productivity improvements and the recovery from customers of some previously incurred program development costs these benefits are partially offset by the rapid escalation on commodity costs and some lingering impact of the cost associated with the warehouse management system that we implemented earlier this year as most of you are aware we use the lastin first out or lifo accounting method for our domestic inventories which represent approximately half of our consolidated inventories in times of rising commodity costs these cost increases are immediately charged to income rather than capitalized in inventory costs we selected this method decades ago as it lowers our taxable income preserving cash flow for business needs rather than making higher tax payments if you read the footnotes to our financial statements youll see that our lifo reserve for yearend inventories is  million this represents  million of lower taxable income over the many years weve used lifo in comparison to the alternative firstin first out or fifo accounting method and as stated in our press release this lifo method lowered our pretax income by  million in the fourth quarter alone like the other companies we continue to experience significant yearoveryear purchased commodity costs in nearly all categories on a global basis steel and petroleum based commodities are at the top of our list of cost pressures we are taking pricing actions in many of our product groups and will continue to negotiate recovery of these costs from our customers in addition we remain focused on our own product cost reduction efforts because of the rapid commodity price increases that we experienced in the fourth quarter it may take a number of months before we accomplish all price recovery for these costs however we are maintaining our longstanding gross margin target of  for fiscal  our tax rate for the quarter was  and for the year the rate was  this is slightly below the low end of the range that we provided last quarter of  to  in the fourth quarter our earnings mix was more heavily weighted to lower tax countries and we received a  percentage point benefit from a foreign dividend and a favorable resolution of a foreign tax decision our tax rate expectation for fiscal  is in range of  to  our capex came in at  million for the year which is down from  million last year we provided an estimate of  million to  million last quarter it slightly exceeded the upper end of that range due to the stronger foreign currencies in the countries where much of our capex took place our capex outlook for fiscal  is a range of  million to  million and our estimate of depreciation and amortization is a range of  million to  million free cash flow came in at  million which is above the range of  million to  million that we previously provided the fiscal  performance compares favorably to the prior year amount of  million our outlook for fiscal  is a range of  million to  million at this point we expect interest expense in  to be comparable to the current year amount of  million our press release contains our fiscal  sales guidance which is an increase of  to  in previous years our pricing has been relatively flat on a composite basis as we continue to redesign products and take out both content and cost for fiscal  we have built in a  price increase into our sales to hopefully compensate for a significant portion of the commodity price increases so we are pleased to be able to report our th consecutive year of record earnings and the fiscal  achieves our expected eps between  and  per share it will be year  of this record string of earnings so with that i will pass it over to bill who will provide more background on our outlook bill william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tom and good morning everyone in the next few minutes and before we open the call up to your questions id like to cover three topics first ill talk a little bit about our fourth quarter highlights then our outlook for fiscal  and then ill give you an update on two of our growth initiatives so starting first with our fourth quarter highlights as tom mentioned our sales growth was  and say that at constant exchange rates it was  looking at our fourth quarter sales by region and in local currencies sales were up  in nafta  in both europe and asiapacific and  in south africa as you may already know we have two reporting segments engine and industrial which are lead by jay ward and charlie mcmurray respectively and id like to give you some of their quarter highlights but before i get started please note that all of the fourth quarter sales numbers i will cover will be stated in local currency so they exclude the positive impact of exchange rate movement and therefore are more indicative of our real business conditions and strength so starting first with our engine segment in europe our european engine business grew by  due to good performances and our sales to offroad equipment oems as well as sales of replacement filters in the aftermarket we attribute our offroad oem growth of  during the quarter to the combination of solid production rates of new equipment by our customers as well as our own market share gains our european engine aftermarket business grew by  aftermarket growth in the european emerging markets has been as weve mentioned before one of our key growth priorities we continue to expand our distribution of sales coverage in the eastern europe russia and the middle east and during the past year this emerging market initiative delivered a  yearoveryear sales increase now switching to asia all of our engine businesses oem offroad oem onroad and the aftermarket had strong quarters up   and  respectively offroad equipment production by our customers is strong across asia as the heavy construction mining and ag end markets there remain in the growth mode truck production picked up in japan leading to our sales increase there and continued healthy economic activity generally throughout the asiapacific region had demand for our replacement filters growing in the quarter and now finally in nafta our engine business is up  offroad equipment sales were up  due primarily to a very strong performance by our aerospace and defense business unit their sales were up over  in the quarter due to the combination of continued strong demand for filters for the new mrap vehicles as well as replacement filters for the military equipment already in the field in addition sales by one of our newest acquisitions afs of our retrofit air filtration systems for the blackhawk helicopters have been very good on the other hand our nafta transportation business was down  in the quarter heavy truck build rates that our customers appeared to have now stabilized but medium and light duty build rates continue to decline and in our nafta engine aftermarket business sales were up  in the quarter a strong equipment utilization rates for larger offroad equipment that are used in heavy construction mining and ag offset the weaker conditions in both the truck and smaller construction equipment related to the housing industry now i switch to the other part of our company the industrial group to talk about some of their highlights so within the industrial group the sales for our industrial filtration solutions business were up  as all  major regions grew between  and  in europe we saw solid demand for our ifs products in western and central europe our nafta sales were strong for both new equipment and replacement filters and in addition our third quarter acquisition of lmc west contributed about  of the  sales increase in nafta during the quarter our gas turbine business had an extremely strong shipment quarter with sales reaching  million which represented a  increase over the same quarter in the prior year growth has been good globally in both the power generation and oil and gas end markets we serve and finally our special applications business set they closed out a record year with sales up full year sales up  the fourth quarter sales of our disk drive filters and membrane filtration products were up  over a very strong finish last year now i am going to switch gears and talk about our outlook for the new year for fiscal  and as you can see in our press release we have provided our initial guidance and that is for our company sales to be up between  and  please note that this includes the benefit of some pricing as tom mentioned but excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions it also assumes that exchange rates remain at current levels so ill start first with a general overall comment we are expecting organic volume growth to be lower next year than the year we just ended as general economic conditions are expected to be weaker in europe now talking about each of the businesses and starting first with engine our full year engine business sales are forecasted to up between  and  within our engine business heavy construction and mining equipment production rates by our customers remain solid however production rates for smaller equipments used primarily in residential construction are expected to remain weak we see our nafta truckrelated business remaining at current levels through the first half of our fiscal year and then beginning to grow in the second half it is expected that another prebuy will begin during calendar  in advance of the  diesel emission regulations and that the calendar  build rates will increase by  to  over  however the exact timing of this projected improvement is difficult to gauge at this time our customers ag equipment production rates is expected to remain strong as the latest reports forecast both us crop prices and farmers incomes to be up which is a positive sign for the ag equipment market and finally in the engine business we expect our aftermarket filter sales to grow as we continue to create proprietary replacement opportunities for ourselves and as we focus on developing new markets internationally now switching to the fiscal  outlook for our industrial segment in our industrial business overall we see full year sales growing at  to  within our ifs business which includes our best collectors and compressed air filters our order backlogs are good and suggest a strong start to the new year in addition we should benefit from market share gains from our new line of recently introduced powercore dust collectors as a result we expect sales growth of  to  in fiscal  in our gas turbine business we have good visibility for shipments over the next few quarters we expect our full year sales growth rate to be in the  to  as there are now some industry capacity constraints we still expect that demand for gas turbines and our filter systems will continue to grow through  and finally we expect our special application business to be up  to  in fiscal  this is expected to be led by continued growth in our ptfe membrane filtration products business now let me give you an update on two of our major growth initiatives and the first is powercore we talked about this for quite a while and we continue to be very successful with this breakthrough air filtration technology our enginerelated powercore sales were up  in the quarter to  million as first fit ph sales grew  and replacement filter sales grew  and as you may have seen earlier this year we raised the bar again with the introduction of our powercore generation or gen powercore gen allows us to further reduce the system size or enhance the system performance which is critically important for our customers given the new engine technologies and their vehicle space and weight constraints we have already won  platforms five onroad and five off with gen and  of the platforms we currently have in either the proposal or development stage are with our new gen technology in the gas turbine we are continuing to market the market introduction of our powercore technology since introduction we shipped  systems and have orders for an additional two systems already in hand for fiscal  and finally as i mentioned a minute ago weve now introduced a new line of dust collectors in our ifs business these new products also use our powercore technology and allow us to deliver a system that is  smaller than the traditional baghouse system it replaces we introduced this product this spring and have been very pleased with this strong initial market acceptance the other growth initiative i want to cover is our expansion projects and as tom mentioned we expect the capex to be between  million and  million in fiscal  in addition to supporting numerous process improvement and cost reduction projects we have a number of major expansion projects underway to support our continued growth we recently finished our major expansion of our existing engineer filter plant in klasterec in the czech republic we are nearing completion of the start up of our air filtration manufacturing line in brazil and we should that should be a production later this fall in india were expanding our existing filtration plant this expansion essentially represents the tripling of the current facility and is necessary to support the continued growth of our customers in india and finally the expansion of our disk drive filter plant in rayong thailand is proceeding on schedule and we expect to have additional manufacturing capacity available later this year now before we open the call up to your questions id like to offer a few summary comments i hope what has happened into our fiscal  results is the strength of the business model we have pursued over the past  plus years the essence of this business model is our relentless focus on growing our company through extensive geographic and end market diversification we have determined that this diversification has reduced the negative impact of any one end market or regional economic cycle it allows us the opportunity combined with effective execution to do two things the first is obviously to serve our customers the second is to continue to deliver record financial results for our shareholders looking forward we will continue to grow and further diversify it within our targeted filter markets we expect that the combination of our diversified portfolio of filtration businesses combined with our effective execution will allow us to deliver yet another record year of sales and earnings in fiscal  as tom mentioned our eps guidance for fiscal  is between  and  per share which is both a new record and up between  and  over the year we just completed achieving this will result in our th consecutive earnings record that is our target and finally before we move to qa i would like to remind you that we will be at the new york stock exchange tomorrow to do two things the first is to host an analyst day and the second is to ring the closing bell to celebrate achieving our first  billon year in revenues our analyst day will be webcast on the investors page of our website we will also provide a link on that page to view the bell ringing ceremony regarding that ceremony earlier this year we decided to have some fun with this impending milestone and we created a guess the date we hit  billion in sales event approximately  of our fellow employees around the world submitted guesses kim webster is one of our  employees who guessed the correct date which was june th kim is a senior buyer from our leicester uk plant and with his wife deborah he will represent our company and our achievement by ringing the closing bell tomorrow afternoon please tune into see it nicole that concludes our prepared remarks now id like to open up it up to the questions question and answer operator thank you sir operator instructions our first question comes from the line of eli lustgarten with longbow securities please go ahead eli lustgarten  longbow securities good morning thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer good morning eli eli lustgarten  longbow securities i have a couple of quick questions on the outlook one in the guidance you talked about foreign currency exchange rates not changing can you give us some idea what kind of foreign currency assumptions you have built into your guidance at this point assuming rates dont change rich sheffer  investor relations eli this is rich sheffer what we are expecting is assuming that the dollar stays about where it is now where its been trading the last few weeks its going to still be a little bit of a tailwind in the first half of the year and somewhere around midyear at these rates it would flip over and create a headwind in the second half so overall right now the total impact could be a slight headwind for the full year eli lustgarten  longbow securities and that means that the you have to fully replace the  of earnings that you reported this year from currency or will we be able to generate a little bit of that we would not fully have to replace it rich sheffer  investor relations the thought is whatever the impact is going to be compared to last year its baked into the guidance so yes we would replace it eli lustgarten  longbow securities yes but so the assumption doesnt have any of the  in it at all thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer hi eli this is tom that is correct eli lustgarten  longbow securities okay because its an impressive gain without the foreign currency that where i am driving to you mentioned   pricing is that pretty well evenly distributed across these businesses or is it skewed in any one action by either an engines or industrial products thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer hi eli this is tom it really varies not only between engine and industrial but within engine and industrial so its hard to be specific without getting into each individual product line but short answer is it really varies eli lustgarten  longbow securities yes and this is will go from like zero to  or  that kind of magnitude thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer even more the upper end is even more eli eli lustgarten  longbow securities okay so you are viewing ph that and finally when looking at your guidance probably the number of the biggest risk is probably the truck recovery which the base of how you do the recovery prebuy will be next year and whether it even occur because of the july fiscal year it could not even occur in  in your fiscal  just on a timing basis and i think you cited that if we did not see upturn until almost your fiscal  would that be lower end of your guidance be flooding by that is that critical to your lower end of the guidance william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer eli this is bill north american heavy truck represents  of our overall sales so even if it didnt happen like or we talked about in our guidance based on with the industry forecast are its really a very small part of our company and its really part of that whole diversification story that weve talked about as we  years ago that would have been a big deal for donaldson as you know because youve followed us for a long time now its not that big a deal  of our revenues for fiscal  eli lustgarten  longbow securities alright you feel pretty comfortable no matter as long as this will depend on your william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer right i mean its an important we have what we want to have is lots of  or  segments so its an important segment but if were not we are not writing that up and down as a company like we used to eli lustgarten  longbow securities and one of that question are there any new developments in platforms or something that would make the  emission then the subsequent  emissions for a construction act on the ak ph engine a significant market for donaldson directly william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer eli this is bill again i think thats baked into our guidance we are working on those programs now for both the on and offroad and thats part of what we are using our new powercore technology is to lock up as many those as we can eli lustgarten  longbow securities so there is no contract and new awards you talked about that you referred  emissions and is that part of your william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer they are related to the emission regulation as you pointed out so its not just emission control devices but its new generation air and liquid filters as well eli lustgarten  longbow securities okay thank you william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer sure thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff hammond with keybanc capital markets please go ahead jeff hammond  keybanc capital markets hi guys william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning jeff jeff hammond  keybanc capital markets just wanted to dig into some of the segments to understand a little bit better some of the moving pieces and i think this plays into the guidance little bit but your offroad is just if you strip out the fx its just been growing exceptionally not the parse still good growth in this quarter but after three quarters at  plus it slowed to  i just wanted to know wanted to understand within that what might be driving that if its a specific region or subvertical and then also special apps i think you mentioned some of that slower growth in disk drive that also slowed pretty materially in the fourth quarter and i just want to understand that dynamic as well william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer jeff bill ill start with your second question on the special apps i think part of that is it had a very strong finish last year so its a tough comparable quarteroverquarter as i noted that they had a yearoveryear they had a very good year in terms of our guidance going forward i think would be may be just a lot of thats driven by the pc market and were using published data to factor into our forecast in terms of whats seen out there on the offroad i think as i mentioned the part of the offroad are offroad business thats the weakest is the smaller equipment thats mostly related to residential we do not see that improving anytime soon we still see strong conditions for the larger equipment which is used for heavy construction and mining so its a mixture of the two and on top of that you have the ag business which has grown quite a bit we see that maintaining sort of a high level but probably not growing much beyond that and our defense business which we had a great quarter so its there are some pluses and minuses and there the weakest part is that smaller equipment related to residential construction jeff hammond  keybanc capital markets okay and then just overall you commented at the beginning that you definitely see lower organic growth in fiscal  i think your main comment around that was some slower growth in europe and what specifically have you seen near term in terms of a change in momentum in europe in general that would facilitate that comment william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer i think what we jeff bill again i think what we are doing there is we are as we are reading in the paper about the calling down the gdp growth rates in the uk and the germany and other parts of europe and thats whats making us cautious we had a strong finish to our business in europe so that but i think its that we are seeing at least reports of weakness in the general sectors in the western europe and we are factoring that into our guidance for next year jeff hammond  keybanc capital markets okay and then finally on the price increases have you already announced all of your price increase that would get you to that  or do you have to announce more and may be just give us a sense of what the feedback youve been getting in terms of push back being able to realize that any kind of demand instruction around some of these more substantial price increases william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer jeff bill again nobody whether as a consumer or in a business likes the word price increase so there is you are not welcomed with open arms when you come in for those types of discussions i think the thing is that everybody now understands that this isnt the temporary situation and its here to stay so generally our initial focus is trying to figure out with our customers ways of offsetting the impact of price increases and as tom mentioned through whether its cost reductions or process improvements to mitigate the impact and then try and negotiate for the recovery of whatever is left we do that as we incur the cost on an actual basis so the  that tom mentioned is our projection for the year in some cases depending on the products if there is a lot of steel for example weve already raised prices were working that in other cases where the materials are different we have not and were already doing that based on the actual cost that weve incurred and so well be doing that throughout the balance in this new fiscal year jeff hammond  keybanc capital markets but would you say what youve already announced youre getting that the realization you need to get to this  william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer no we havent we havent done all the pricing actions that would total up to the  because we probably havent seen all of that impact some of thats based on an anticipated impact to the fiscal  and as i mentioned we dont ask for the price increase until we actually incur it jeff hammond  keybanc capital markets okay perfect thanks guys william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin maczka with bbt capital markets please go ahead kevin maczka  bbt capital markets bill tom good morning william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning kevin thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer good morning kevin kevin maczka  bbt capital markets i have a question on some of the operating costs and some of the things that may be onetime in nature may be not things like it spending the four plants that youre expanding or launching this year are some of those costs onetime in nature that may not recur in  and the third bucket i guess is rd im assuming that will recur next year but if you can just comment on those three items is there anything big there that wont repeat to the same extent in  thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer kevin this is tom i guess first of all keep in mind weve provided the guidance of  operating expenses as a percent of sales for next year as we look at i think youre primarily interested in the fourth quarter  to  first  was just a very low quarter from an operating expenses standpoint i believe  but a couple of things kevin i did mention a reclassification of some rd expenses from cost of sales to operating expenses and that created about a half a point impact in the quarter now that has no impact for the year because that was an adjustment from the first three quarters to the fourth quarter no impact for the year but that did have an impact in the fourth quarter and of course we dont anticipate for that to increase there was a little bit of a mix issue both if you think about the very high sales in our industrial segment versus the engine segment industrial runs a little higher operating expenses and a little higher gross margin than the engine segment so mix is going to really vary quartertoquarter the product development expenses were up yearoveryear that was about just twotenths of a point and that will very likely continue in the future as we focus on a lot of the product development initiatives that bill mentioned it infrastructure cost i think we had a bit of a blip in the fourth quarter that was about a half of a point of the increase so i would expect that to be a more normal level of spend in f  and then as in any quarter there is there were some small onetime items that came up none of them individually at all significant but that had a couple of tenths of a point impact as well so i hope that answers your question kevin kevin maczka  bbt capital markets okay and then on the expansion projects bill you mentioned the four plants that are either very closed to completion or will be completed later this year i guess once those are complete give us an update on how you feel about your capacity at that point is maybe the plan to have another phase necessary of further expansions beyond that william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good question i think its unlikely that well have four projects underway at the same time if we look at like  or  months from now just because of i think we this is a sort of unusual period where we had four at the same time but typically kevin we are always going to have probably  or  or  underway adding capacity in different parts of the world how do we feel about our capacity situation right now i think were in pretty good shape we have some plants that we havent announced yet so i cant disclose it for additional capacity but thats more of is part of that normal process that i mentioned where we have to add some every year and its a consequence approach so its a good thing kevin maczka  bbt capital markets okay and just one more if i could tom can you just help me reconcile you said  percentage points of prices baked into your revenue guidance but did you say organic volume growth would be negative and so my question is if thats true with very little foreign exchange impact how do we get to the  to  on the top line thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer kevin tom again i dont think anybody said that organic growth would be negative so if you take our sales guidance and back off the  for selling price increases the remainder would essentially be organic growth kevin maczka  bbt capital markets okay got it thanks for the clarification operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian drab with william blair please go ahead brian drab  william blair good morning william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning brian brian drab  william blair congratulations on a great year in a tough environment william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you brian drab  william blair i think most of my questions have been answered at this point but just a followup question on the operating expenses you mentioned that the it expense in the fourth quarter was a little bit of a blip and i was just wondering if you could give us some more color on that and also talk a little bit about the warehouse management system at your rensselaer operation to whether your expenses came in inline with expectations and if that project is done thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer yes brain tom here ill take the last one first for the distribution expenses at our us facility in indiana we came in very close to the guidance we provided last quarter the incremental expenses there in the fourth quarter were about  million so for the second half of the year that totaled up to about  million and we think we have that pretty much behind us now so we arent expecting any of those incremental expenses to go forward in the future and then on the it expenses we had a couple of systems initiatives wrap up in the fourth quarter and at the conclusion of those implementation there is a bit of a blip in spending so again customer care systems wrapping up erp modules and things like that came up in the fourth quarter and that caused the increase in spending brian drab  william blair okay great thats all i have thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of charlie brady with bmo capital markets please go ahead unidentified analyst good morning this is actually tom brickman ph standing in for charlie brady william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tom unidentified analyst just a couple of questions you mentioned that the gross margin you had some impacts from the you said some recovery of previously incurred product development cost can you go in a detail about that a little bit please thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer tom this is thomas verhage that was a relatively small impact about fourtenths of a point and that happens from time to time where we feel a loud costs that we previously incurred we covered them from customers in a quarter later than when we actually incurred the costs unidentified analyst okay and youve mentioned a little bit about how its a small percentage of your sales but first half  translation product sales i guess you were talking about how the trucks onroad trucks are only about  of your sales but can you just talk about expectations for translational products in general first half  william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer first half of what tom this is bill first half of our fiscal  unidentified analyst yes william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer pretty flat and then in the next calendar year in advance of the emission regulations in  that we anticipate that another prebuy or at least a volume increase for whatever reasons but we probably most are dealers prebuy so i think i said  to  calendar year  over calendar  so that would affect a second half of our fiscal  unidentified analyst got you okay yes in the special applications products you also mentioned this again you were saying whats causing the slowdown in growth just to going into more detail about that william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer tom bill again i think its just based on what we see with the industry forecasts for hard drive shipments hard disk drive shipments unidentified analyst okay yes and finally the did you have a gross margin percentage that was for the commodity costs did you break that out just for the quarter thomas r verhage  vice president and chief financial officer yes tom tom verhage actually i am glad you asked that impact for the quarter was about  and as we mentioned in the press release and i mentioned in my comments that is almost entirely due to our optional election of the lifo method of accounting because all of those when we purchase those commodities at those increased costs that goes into our income statement immediately rather than capitalizing that in inventory so had we been on fifo we would have reported  million more for additional pretax income in the quarter than we did by being under lifo method here in the us unidentified analyst okay and okay so going forward you said weve already put through price increases going offset the steel cost pressures youve seen but as far as other commodity cost i mean i guess in the near future maybe in the next quarter or so you may still see the pressures but after that the price hike should flow through i guess just wondering about how quickly the price hikes will flow through william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer tom it is bill cook on a gradual basis and again as i on a as incurred basis so as we as it affect us we go to our customers and start negotiating for price increases for any part that we cant mitigate through cost reductions so its happening now and its going to happen through at least the first half of the fiscal year new fiscal year unidentified analyst i got you okay thank you william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer sure operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line andrew obin with merrill lynch please go ahead andrew obin  merrill lynch hi guys good morning william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer good morning andrew andrew obin  merrill lynch just a couple of small questions what percentage of offhighway equipment is ag equipment could you comment on that rich sheffer  investor relations andrew this is rich ag makes up between  and  of our offroad equipment andrew obin  merrill lynch has the mix shifted as ag has been growing has the mix shifted or have you had enough international growth on the construction side that the mix has remained fairly comparable in the past couple of years rich sheffer  investor relations yes given the strength in a lot of our offroad end markets weve seen maybe  or  but still stand in within that band so basically all the bolts have been lifting andrew obin  merrill lynch and the second question i have is just as i said its a small question but you noted a relatively flat production i guess in trucks in europe and is that based on an industry forecast or is that based on specific conversations you guys had with your customers in europe rich sheffer  investor relations andrew rich again just based on our internal forecast we take into account both fee the published forecast and our conversations with our customers specifically so we are looking for singledigit growth in the truck business in europe in fiscal  andrew obin  merrill lynch okay william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer andrew this is bill we always start with your reports and then factor in what we hear from our customers as well andrew obin  merrill lynch great need to know when i ask you guys for industry color no but i appreciate it thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of craig stone with kayne anderson investment please go ahead craig stone  kayne anderson rudnick have you seen any competition for the second fit of powercore applications if you havent why not and are the oems building any language into the warranties about powercore william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer this is bill on the powercore what we had anticipated initially when we launched the first generation that when it was successful because we intended for it to be successful that there wouldnt be people trying to copy it we have lot in intellectual property around it and we defend that aggressively but our best defense with powercore is to replace our cells with new technology and thats what weve done with the generation or the gen so were trying to see some people trying to get into the market on a replacement with the gen and now weve raised the bar again with our gen in terms of the question about the oes the oes like our powercore because theyre very interested in protecting the replacement parts and thats an important part of their business so it allows them and us through them to lock up that replacement parts business so they are very positive i am not sure if i answered your question but were you talking about warranty specifically craig stone  kayne anderson rudnick i am asking if the oems require powercore as replacement filters in order to maintain the warranty william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer okay the oems both today nothing else will fit generally and deliver the performance so i guess in the sense in order to protect the warranty they have to gap these filter thats going to work the answer is yes but im not sure there is specific warranty language that requires the powercore craig stone  kayne anderson rudnick thank you operator thank you our next question is a followup question from the line of kevin maczka with bbt capital markets please go ahead kevin maczka  bbt capital markets i just had a question on the gas turbine business it was such a huge year this year so youve got tough comps obviously but bill you talked about some new powercore products coming soon youre in the middle of an upcycle there is still strength in your international power gen and oil and gas markets im just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on what you are seeing that would dictate a  to  top line william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer i think kevin the issue there is there are other not related to donaldson but there are other supplier constraints for the turbine manufacturers that are limiting how many turbines they can manufacture and so that the market is as youre suggesting is marketing conditions are stronger in that but there is a capacity constraint in the production of turbines kevin maczka  bbt capital markets okay and can you just talk a little bit on your is there a notable mix there between power gen and oil and gas and maybe any other end market william m cook  chairman president and chief executive officer yes kevin i am not a notable mix between the two nothing has
