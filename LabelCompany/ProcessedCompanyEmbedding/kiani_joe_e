statements which reflect masimos current judgment including certain of our expectations regarding fiscal  financial performance however they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections and forecasts are discussed in detail in our sec filings including our most recent form k and form q you will find these in the investor section of our website ill now pass the call to joe kiani joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer thank you eli good afternoon and thank you for joining us for masimos second quarter  earnings call were happy to again report results that surpassed our projections as in the first quarter we continue to see strong worldwide adhesive sensor growth which we believe was attributable both to increase in hospital census and our growing base of new customers as evidenced by the prior two quarters growth and another strong quarter of driver shipments as we shipped  additional set and rainbow set oximeters in q excluding our handheld and finger sic fingertip  pulse oximeters here are some of other highlights from our second quarter our product sales grew by nearly  our second quarter  gaap earnings per share was  including an  per share gain related to the new accounting rules for gains realized on stock option exercises and an approximate  fx benefit this is a  increase from our gaap earnings a year ago –  excuse me important new clinical studies  were published during q continuing to validate the growing list of masimo technologies and products that are reducing costs and improving patient care and we received two important fda clearances which will expand our domestic product portfolio and on which i will discuss later in todays call were encouraged that our year plan to achieve strong earnings growth built on a solid foundation of breakthrough products and strong and broad service has continued to become more visible and consistent over the last two years encouragingly our results for the first half of  have exceeded our original projections and as a result we are very happy to be able to once again increase our financial guidance for the rest of  next mark will review our second quarter financial results in more detail and also provide you with our new  financial guidance i will then discuss some additional second quarter business product and clinical highlights mark mark p de raad  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you joe and good afternoon everybody our second quarter  total revenues were  million which was up  from  million in the prior year period total product revenues rose by  or  on a constant currency basis versus the second quarter of  product revenues for q exceeded our expectations due as joe noted to both continued strength in attracting new customers notably in some of our key ous regions as well as an increase in us hospital census rainbow product revenues for q totaled  million which was up  from  million in the prior year period this increase is consistent with our projected total annual rainbow growth of approximately  our q sphb revenues declined to  million from  million in the prior year period this decline was due primarily to a difficult comparison involving two large license orders last year as well as the slight delay in the shipment of an ous order which will now be realized in q our worldwide enduser or direct business which includes sales through justintime distributors grew  in the second quarter to  million versus  million in the year ago period our direct business represented approximately  of total product revenue in the quarter versus  in the prior year period oem sales comprised the remaining  and rose by  versus the prior year period to  million by geography total us product revenue increased by  to  million compared to  million in the same quarter of  our total ous product revenues of  million rose by  versus  million in the same prior year period and were up  on a constant currency basis ous revenues represented approximately  of total q product revenues up from  in the prior year quarter our second quarter  gaap product gross margin was  up by  basis points from the previous year  this improvement is attributable to a number of factors including a more favorable product mix the continuing benefits from our value engineering efforts and other manufacturing cost initiatives as well as favorable fx movements including the yearoveryear decline in the value of the mexican peso versus the us dollar reported second quarter  total operating expenses were  million an increase of  million or  versus  million in the prior year period our sga expenses were  million an increase of  million or  while our rd spending was  million an increase of  versus the year ago period the increase in rd expenses related to additional engineering resources to support both ongoing masimo new product development efforts as well as additional staffing related to our commitment to reinvest the medical device tax savings second quarter  operating income was  million compared to  million in the prior year period this significant increase in yearoveryear operating income is a result of a combination of factors including strong product revenue growth improved product gross margins and continued operating expense control encouragingly for the third quarter in a row our operating income margin has exceeded  and in fact was up over  basis points above the same prior year quarter q  nonoperating income was approximately  compared to nonoperating expense of  million in the prior year period the  in q nonoperating income includes approximately  million in net interest expense related to borrowings under our line of credit less other interest income this interest expense was more than offset by approximately  million in favorable foreign exchange translation gains resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from april   to july   on our ous local currency denominated balance sheets our second quarter  effective tax rate fell to  down from  in the same period last year and well below our expected rate of approximately  this lower than expected q effective tax rate was due to a  million benefit we recognized related to our adoption of asu  the new accounting rule regarding the reporting of tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as youll recall the new accounting rules require that the tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options are reported as a discrete benefit to the current quarter effective tax rate as part of the profit and loss statement in the past these tax benefits were reported directly to equity without this discrete item our adjusted q effective tax rate would have been  very close to our  projection as a result of this new accounting rule our q  fully diluted eps was increased by  per diluted share following a  increase in q  our average shares outstanding for q were  million down from  million in the year ago period but up from  million in q  during the q quarter we repurchased an additional  shares increasing our yeartodate purchases to  million shares the sequential increase in our q weighted share count was primarily due to the impact that a higher stock price has on the dilutive value of stock options outstanding under the treasury stock method second quarter gaap net income increased by approximately  to  million or  per diluted share including the  per diluted share benefit related to the discrete q accounting change and the  benefit from movements in foreign exchange rates as of july   our dso was  days compared to  days as of april   and compared to  days as of january   our inventory turns remained at  consistent with the april   level and were down from  as of january   total cash and cash equivalents as of july   were  million compared to  million as of january   during the first six months of the year we have generated approximately  million in cash from operations and  million from the exercise of stock options these funds were used in part to repurchase  million shares at a cost of approximately  million and to repay approximately  million in our line of credit borrowings and to fund our operations during the most recent second quarter alone in addition to the repurchase of approximately  shares at a cost of approximately  million we also repaid  million on our line of credit lowering our total borrowings outstanding from  million at the end of q to  million at the end of q now id like to take just a moment to update our fiscal  financial guidance which is based on the best information we have available to us we are now projecting that our total fiscal  gaap revenues will be approximately  million including  million in product revenues up from our prior estimate of  million which was then up  from our original fiscal  guidance of  million in product revenues we now expect our annual gaap  product gross profit margins to be approximately  up from our prior guidance of  we now also expect our fiscal  operating expenses to be approximately  million which is up slightly from our prior guidance of approximately  million we continue to expect that our tax rate for the remaining six months of fiscal  will be approximately  we are projecting that our average quarterly weighted shares outstanding for the rest of fiscal  to be between  million and  million and as a result of these changes we are now expecting our  gaap eps to be approximately  up from our prior estimate of  per diluted share and our original projection at the start of the year of  per diluted share and with that ill turn the call back to joe joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer thank you mark i want to congratulate our team for our performance through the first half of the year we intend to continue to achieve results that exemplify our greater growth potential stemming from our breakthrough technologies that have had a profound impact on patient care and cost of care as mark just described we have once again boosted our full year forecast to incorporate a more positive outlook for  we are realizing higher revenues per drivers across our installed base as utilization has risen in addition steady growth for rainbow and recent regulatory clearances where important new products provide us with greater confidence that well exceed our prior target set at the beginning of this year were consistently winning new hospital conversions for masimo set and rainbow set oximeters during q we received two noteworthy product clearances from the fda first we received fda clearance for our o regional oximetry monitor enabling us to participate in an estimated  million market that is growing by  annually given the accuracy and easeofuse of o compared to competitive monitors in the field we hope to capture meaningful share in this market in the next few years in fact one of the worlds leading centers for cardiovascular medicine and transplantation dhzb the german heart center in berlin has adopted our o regional oximetry and sedline brain function monitoring technologies to monitor their patients in the operating room and intensive care unit dhzb is a specialized hospital dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and thoracic diseases implantation of mechanical circulatory support systems and heart and lung transplantations and treats more than  inpatients and  outpatients annually the second novo  fda clearance we received in q was for our wearable tetherless radius monitor with rainbow measurement capabilities the rainbow version of radius allows for patient mobility within the hospital and includes continuous hemoglobin measurement as an option which may be useful for detecting postoperative internal hemorrhage we also recently initiated the launches of nextgeneration sedline and nextgeneration sphb products in europe both of which incorporate substantially improved technology that increases their clinical utility on a related note we are happy to report that the rollout of rainbow parameters within both lowacuity and highacuity monitors made by philips have commenced ge is also now selling rainbow and its lowacuity monitor line unfortunately weve recently learned that ges rollout of rainbow in their highacuity monitors would likely be delayed by two years to three years on the clinical front two papers were recently published that support the clinical utility of masimos innovative technologies in a study utilized using the firstgeneration pronto pulse cooximeter to noninvasively measure total hemoglobin and  patients sphb was successfully measured  of the time with being  labbased hemoglobin values of  plus and minus  grams per deciliter and mean noninvasive sphb value of  plus or minus  grams per deciliter the authors dr ryan and colleagues at the university of tennessee health science center at le bonheur childrens hospital found that noninvasive and invasive measurements correlated well and that the rapid availability of results and the lack of requirement of venipuncture noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring may be a valuable adjunct in the initial evaluation and monitoring of pediatric trauma patients they also noted that noninvasive sphb testing may be most effective in determining when invasive testing of hemoglobin is warranted a paper just published in transplantation proceedings authored by dr lee and colleagues at chang gung memorial hospital in taiwan investigated the utility of pvi and concluded that pvi may serve as a reliable estimate of cardiac preload status in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation as higher pvi values correlated with lower right ventricular enddiastolic volume value  so that an increase in ventricular preload status could be inferred from a decrease in pvi during olts they also noted that right ventricular enddiastolic volume was better correlated with pvi than with other static filling pressure such as central venous pressure or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure therefore giving a safer faster and better estimate of fluid responsiveness these two papers are just the latest examples of the high clinical value that our technologies provide to clinicians as they strive to improve patient care in fact we estimate that the use of set pulse oximeter rainbow sphb and pvi will save an average hospital  million a year in the age  of both the affordable care act and the expansion of acos technologies that help clinicians get it right the first time are what hospitals want in closing our focus on delivering on our year plan is based on our guiding principles of remaining faithful to our promises and responsibilities we are encouraged that our first half of  financial performance has exceeded our original  guidance and in doing so has allowed us to once again increase our financial guidance for the year we are looking forward to what will be a record year in  as we head into the final stretch of our year plan in  as always we remain focused on our mission to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications with our breakthrough noninvasive monitoring technologies with that well open the call to questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of lawrence keusch from raymond james your line is open joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer hello john hsu  raymond james  associates inc good afternoon everyone hi this is – hey joe this is john shu in for larry how are you joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer oh good hi john how are you john hsu  raymond james  associates inc doing well thanks doing well hey so obviously a very nice quarter obviously looking at marks comments on the strong operating margin expansion maybe we could start there three straight quarters at  obviously you want to get up closer to  over the next year couple of years so again can you just remind us outside of the gross margin opportunity on the product side with value engineering kind of what gets us there and your confidence around the timing for that joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer certainly certainly value engineering work that weve been doing the last few years is resulting in some of those gains our value based – our pricing  with our customers and our discipline with that along with the expansion of the new products obviously weve been talking about rainbow for a while but were seeing excellent growth with sedline excellent growth with capnography and now o so adding set rainbow and now root which have these new modalities together along with the open connectivity and creating the connective hub for the hospitals we think will help us drive strong revenue gains as we manage our expenses to what we believe are sustainable given the initial investment we made in the first   period of the year plan john hsu  raymond james  associates inc okay great thats helpful and then just kind of shifting gears to international i guess two quick ones for you one the sizing if you could provide us with the size of the international order in hemoglobin that shifted  to the third quarter and then also any updates regarding the size of – and timing for the middle east tender thank you joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer well not to get too much into the minutia all i can say had we had that order in q our revenues for hemoglobin would have grown  instead of being in decline also given some of the factors of the last  same quarter a period ago but what i can tell you on the middle east were working really well with them the run rate of sales have been excellent we did regain the tender that we had won last year and in fact the hospitals run rate for that was probably two times three times of what we did last year with them however there is pressure from the finance minister for these hospitals to not automatically get what they asked for so they will be working towards getting what they want but instead of it being preapproved for the whole year theyll have to seek it on a regular basis so while all of that will mean not much for this year for us because weve already projected worst case anyway and we are more than happy to meet that with the new projections we gave you well have to track what really happens on the street in q and q and then hopefully q of next year we can tell you what to expect for the rest of the year based on their historical usage pattern because unfortunately we cant rely on the tender request and tender win that we had given the way the finance minister has i guess rammed in  that freedom from the hospitals and well request additional demands on a regular basis john hsu  raymond james  associates inc okay great thats very helpful and then just lastly the royalty revenues have obviously actually been doing a little bit better versus the prior year and you did raise guidance by  million for the year so just any update you can provide us on the status of discussions with medtronic on royalty agreement joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer we havent reached any new agreement but we still remain optimistic that the royalties will continue till october  given that we won the ipr on two of the patents that they went  to try to eliminate the one that we won goes till october  the one that we partially lost expires next month so that – obviously the royalties havent changed so we think things will remain till october  and if we can do something more with medtronic well be announcing it as soon as we have it john hsu  raymond james  associates inc okay great thank you for taking my questions joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer thank you so much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of bill quirk from piper jaffray your line is open william r quirk  piper jaffray  co great hi thanks joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer hello bill william r quirk  piper jaffray  co good afternoon everybody hi joe joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer how are you doing mr quirk william r quirk  piper jaffray  co doing very well sir and it sounds like based on the quarter i think you guys are as well quick question i guess for perhaps mark if im doing the math correctly here mark when i net out the change from the accounting treatment as well as fx and of course your organic eps upside in the quarter it looks like youre assuming – again outside of accounting and outside of fx – that the incremental upside is going to be driven by the core business it looks like its a couple of pennies over the next two quarters relative to previous guidance am i doing the math right there mark p de raad  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah yeah directionally thats exactly right william r quirk  piper jaffray  co okay mark p de raad  chief financial officer  executive vice president the success we had in the second quarter made us confident enough to take up our projected revenue guidance for both q and q in the range of about  million we also though because of the higher amount of weighted shares ended up essentially you could say effectively losing  because of the impact of the now projected higher share number for q and q so the combination of that the higher revenue of about  million each quarter offset by slightly higher weighted share numbers resulted in a net increase of about  for both q and q william r quirk  piper jaffray  co okay got it very clear and just to be clear mark thats obviously organic i mean it sounds like any of this change related to tax treatment is obviously going to be triggered upon exercise of options correct and doesnt sound like you really have anything dialed in in terms of expectations there mark p de raad  chief financial officer  executive vice president correct yeah we actually cant because of the discrete nature of those we cant even include those in any kind of forward guidance number one because its very difficult of course to project what kind of stock option exercises might occur and secondly because it simply isnt allowed as part of your forward effective tax rate guidance william r quirk  piper jaffray  co understood okay thank you and then a couple for joe if i may joe the comment around the ge highacuity monitor delay could you add a little bit of color there and then separately just curious we got the update around medtronic in the previous question anything to say on with respect to philips thanks joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer sure sure on the ge given that of course we are in possession of confidential information that i cannot disclose all i can tell you this delay had nothing to with us its something that is an internal issue for them but with their permission we wanted to share with you where they are the good news is philips has fully rolled out dräger has been out there for a while with rainbow technology welch allyn zoll and many other oems so were anxious to get ge out there but i know theyre doing everything they can but fortunately things like this sometimes happen in the product development cycle as far as our litigation with philips as you know its been broken up in four phases we won phase one for  million verdict which was not finalized which actually may end up being a good thing with the  supreme court recently changed the standard for willful infringement we think we have a great willful infringement case against philips which will be not only bringing up on the phase  coming up in january but well seek to bring back on the phase one victory as well where they have admitted that they infringed our technology before even the trial began for us the  phase  that will be the antitrust suit and patents used case  against us that would happen in march of next year and then phase  is some additional patents we have against them along with our antitrust suit against them and that has not been scheduled yet so in summary if i was going to tell you what i think will happen i think hopefully assuming we win the antitrust and patent issues  in march probably about  months after that im sure philips will appeal it to the court of appeals federal circuit court of appeals which we expect we should win and so we think sometime in about two years from now well have our first check from philips and maybe with the prejudgment interest postjudgment interest if there is willfulness found  made it could be much bigger than the  million that we secured in the phase  trial and postjudgment ruling by judge stark william r quirk  piper jaffray  co very comprehensive thanks joe joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer thank you thank you bill one more question operator we have a question from the line of brian weinstein from william  blair sic william blair  your line is open brian d weinstein  william blair  co llc hey guys how are you joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer hello brian brian d weinstein  william blair  co llc hi and so joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer good how are you brian d weinstein  william blair  co llc good thanks so question for you on market share where do you guys think you are in market share in pulse oximetry and what percentage of the available market are you taking every year at this point joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer we dont really know what our market share is those are difficult to assess we do believe we are growing two times three times the rate of growth in the pulse oximetry market given that were now – weve been growing for almost two years at above  rate so unfortunately thats all i have for you i know there is surveys that are done by independent surveying companies i dont know how much i can trust those so therefore i dont want to state what they say because i know there are ways of guessing at  those numbers is not a scientific as how sometimes theyre truly done when economists get involved in big case trials and so forth brian d weinstein  william blair  co llc okay mark question for you on operating expenses and i guess joe for you as well you answered various questions just talking about kind of controls there but in general what are you guys doing on the operating expense side to kind of make sure that youre going to continue to get that leverage and what are the programs that you have in place and can just give us any more color on how you think about managing opex mark p de raad  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure sure brian i think as weve been articulating for the past couple of years now actually we changed really our direction towards planning our future level of total investment in operating expenses and we changed it from a perspective of identifying various targeted opportunities and ways to expand the business and essentially determining whether to fund those kind of expenses to one in which we just simply said theres a fixed amount of operating expense that were willing to invest each year and then we work very very diligently internally to prioritize all of the various spending initiatives that we have but at the end of the day were limiting ourselves to x amount of dollars of spending growth so because of that approach obviously there is a tremendous amount of control in terms of our ability to dictate essentially what level of spending were going to be at and thats something we started at the end of  its continued all the way through  and is obviously continuing through this year and as we look forward for the next couple of years there is no intention to change that type of forced prioritization of investments in order to hit a fixed amount of aggregate spending dollars increase brian d weinstein  william blair  co llc okay thanks for that answer and my last question is on pricing is there any change here when youre signing new contracts joe you talked about kind of pricing discipline are you seeing medtronic use price or are  they still being a responsible player thank you joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer so i dont think anything has changed on pricing we see medtronic doing the same thing that covidien was doing pricingwise given that we from clinical studies have data that shows we can say that average hospital of  beds about  million a year we – not to mention the lifesaving impact of our technology the eye damage reduction in the nicu of our technology we believe our pricing is just right and thats not too low but consistent to wanting to help our customers reduce cost of care we always calculate that into our pricing strategy so the good news is customers are willing to give us a small premium for the value that our technology brings to them that both saved them money big money not small pennies but also helped them take better care of their patients brian d weinstein  william blair  co llc great thanks joe e kiani  chairman  chief executive officer thank you so much brian and i want to just add one thing the reason we can grow our expenses the way that mark mentioned in a very disciplined fashion is because we had grown as you know our infrastructure a little bit ahead of plan normal plans the way we would do things given the royalties we were gaining from covidien medtronic and that has allowed us now – i guess the last part of our year plan to not have to grow our expenses yet not be choking the company when it comes to both product that saves lives and helps people as well as the number of people we need from an infrastructure perspective to treat our customers as they are accustomed to so were really happy that the year plan is working were happy that our investors have stuck by us and now are seeing the stock working so we will do our best to continue this commitment to you and look forward to our next quarter results in a few months thank you all for joining us operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in todays conference this concludes the program you may now disconnect

many people the perfect job is one that provides them with security and the means to a comfortable lifestyle and actually enjoying what they do doesn’t always come with the package but for joe e kiani and the approximately  worldwide employees of masimo corp an irvinebased medical technology developer loving their work goes without saying kiani and his workers  whom he calls “purists” for their love of the job  have ridden a wave of passion in their purpose to great success with revenue expected to top  million in  smart business spoke with kiani about the importance of integrity maintaining the right culture and keeping all your doors open keep your focuswe have unpretentious leadership focused on our guiding principles great products and great people unpretentious leadership means not pretending to act a certain way you think someone in my role should act but rather staying focused on what matters which is great principles great products and great people i see sometimes when i meet other executives that there is an air about them as though they’re playing some part out of a movie if you are playing that role you’re spending more time wondering how people perceive you rather than just doing what you’re supposed to do and trying to fulfill expectations whether you’re making ice cream or in our case noninvasive blood monitors you have to stay focused on good principles making a good product and hiring the best people you can we’re here to exceed our customers’ expectations by making great products and services the dangers of growing too fast are that no  you could disappoint your customers if you can’t maintain the quality of both the product and the people no  you might bring on people too fast that might not be a great fit for the culture we’re very worried about that so we’re watching those things very closely and i spend a lot of time with operations and with the teams to make sure everyone knows how important it is to not lose sight of those things you have to keep making sure the new people that come are acclimated to the culture but it hasn’t been difficult and we’ve been able to do it because we made sure the core of the people we had were cut from the same cloth since we’ve gotten bigger it’s those people  not me  that are teaching the new people what matters and why we’re all here be available to your staffthat saying ‘opendoor policy’ is a good way to say it because your door has to be open if you close that door too often people will … just stop coming by because they know you don’t want to see them when someone does sneak their head in unless you’re doing something that’s very very important that’s got to be done in a timely basis you’ve really got to put it down put a big smile on your face and react to whatever issues people are bringing to you i have a lot of things i want to get done during a day and i find i get very few of them done during the day i do them after my kids go to sleep and i do them until about midnight because i don’t want to take away that time for anyone to walk in and talk to me as i go around my executive team if i see people don’t have that in a friendly way i try to remind them to open their doors and remind them that their job is to be a leader more than getting a particular job done the most important thing is to make sure … each level agrees on the same values and has the same culture because they’re going to be the ones who are going to touch the next level the most we’ve grown by  percent in the last year so even if i wanted to there’s no way i could meet with everybody and spend time with everybody as much as i need to guide your company by your own principlesbusiness principles should be no different than an individual’s highest principles before i started masimo i was involved in a company when i was  or  years old and it was the first time i was at a high level in a company the businesspeople there were about to sell the company to another company and they were making false statements about how far the product was i had to really think about it because at that point i was wondering if maybe that was how business was done it was a very painful process for me to step up and say no and i wrote a letter to the ceo and the chairman of the board and told them where the product actually was it wasn’t pretty but at that moment i realized that your personal principles  hopefully they’re good ones  have to be the company’s the entity does not take on some ruthless whateverittakes kind of principle it’s got to be yours integrity is the most important trait a business leader can have i hope whatever happens to not lose sight of our principles i say that because our human nature sometimes goes against what we should be doing so it’s a constant fight i hope i’m close enough to the customer and the technology that i can maintain the vision for the company and keep an appreciation for the talent the people because at the end of the day you can have great vision and integrity but if you don’t have the people to execute you’re not going to make it success is being happy most of the time which can only be attained if you live up to your own principles success for the company is the same building a successful company based on principles and integrity not greed and power how to reach masimo corp wwwmasimocom or   leave a reply
