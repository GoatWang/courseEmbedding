treesnake on guamproduct type science featureyear authors fritts t and d leasmantannersuggested citation fritts t and d leasmantanner  the brown treesnake on guam shortly after world war ii and before  the brown treesnake was accidentally transported from its native range in the south pacific to guam probably as a stowaway in ship cargo as a result of abnormally abundant prey resources on guam and the absence of natural predators and other population controls brown treesnake populations reached unprecedented numbers snakes caused the extirpation of most of the native forest vertebrate species thousands of power outages affecting private commercial and military activities widespread loss of domestic birds and pets and considerable emotional trauma to residents and visitors alike when snakes invaded human habitats with the potential for severe envenomation of small children since guam is a major transportation hub in the pacific numerous opportunities exist for the brown treesnakes on guam to be introduced accidentally to other pacific islands as passive stowaways in ship and air traffic from guam numerous sightings of this species have been reported on other islands and an incipient population is probably established on saipan it is important that people who may come in contact with the brown treesnake particularly on neighboring islands and other highrisk sites understand the scope of this problem and how to identify the snake so proper action can be taken this resource has been developed to provide source materials on the history of the invasion continuing threats research results and containment and management of the brown treesnake boiga irregularis in guam and its relevance to other islands and mild continental environments related projects title
