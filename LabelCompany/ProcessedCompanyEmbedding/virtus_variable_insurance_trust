annuity companies logo httpphotosprnewswirecomprnhnemlogo  logo httpwwwnewscomcomcgibinprnhnemlogo  on july  the edge series board of trustees approved the appointment of virtus as advisor and distributor of the trust and several fund mergers that if approved by fund shareholders should improve the scale and marketability of the trust the trust comprises  funds and  billion in assets at june   that are investment options in phoenixs variable life and annuity products  virtus currently serves as administrator to the trust and subadvisor to  million of fund assets and will assume subadvisory responsibilities for an additional  million of fund assets  goodwin capital advisers an affiliate of phoenix and aberdeen asset management will continue to manage  million of assets under subadvisory agreements with virtus four of the funds with approximately  million of assets will not be part of the transaction and will be merged into a thirdparty variable insurance trust at a later date  phoenix has an additional  billion of variable product assets managed by external advisors philip k polkinghorn phoenixs senior executive vice president business development and president of the phoenix edge series fund said the transaction is consistent with the companys recent history of strategic partnerships with organizations that can provide particular expertise and benefit phoenix

gives us a new product line that we can offer to other insurance companies as we expand our distribution reach into the variable insurance trust marketplace aylward said  we look forward to building on our relationship with phoenix customers and offering our investment management and administration expertise to other insurance companies financial terms of the agreement which is expected to close
