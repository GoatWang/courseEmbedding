response demand response has become a critical component of electrical system planning utilities and regulatory commissions across the continent are setting goals to increase supply from renewable resources and decrease reliance on costly and outdated power plants meanwhile demand for electricity has increased with no sign of slowing efforts to meet increased demand have pushed more electricity

business operations facility equipment suffers the most from voltage fluctuations due to grid instability it may become critically damaged or even stop working at low voltage levels on a larger scale
