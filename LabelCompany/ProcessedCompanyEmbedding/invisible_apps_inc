for employment law change eli portnoy contributor eli portnoy is the ceo  cofounder of sense more posts by this contributor how uber can protect consumer privacy more than a year ago matthew panzarino wrote an article on techcrunch in which he described a new type of mobile app experience that he coined the invisible app he predicted that we would imminently see the rise of a huge number of apps that would live in the background anticipating our needs based on sensor and contextual data and do things for us before we even had to ask what an exciting vision the trends are clearly on the side of the invisible app our phones are getting more and more sensors and these tiny components are also getting faster and more accurate and draining significantly less battery in fact the newest smartphones have more than  sensors that can combine to detect things as subtle as whether you are driving up a hill or biking down a hill now the computer in our pocket can not only access all the information in the world but also can automatically understand where we are what we are doing and what is happening around us then the apple watch was announced and matthew’s vision grew even more exciting and more likely this new product would now be able to take all the sensorintelligence our invisible apps would be producing and have a place to conveniently display it — our wrist running into a meeting and need to know the background of the person with whom you are meeting your calendar would anticipate this and conveniently present that information on your wrist but more than a year later these apps haven’t emerged where is the app that knows i am still in the office at  pm and orders me food where is the app that knows i am out and i’ve had one too many beers and orders me an uber where is the app that scolds me for not going to the gym this week why aren’t invisible apps here if our phones are getting smarter with more sensors and using that intelligence is a widely understood opportunity why aren’t the apps built on our phones also using those sensors to be smarter and anticipate our needs privacy the first issue that developers of invisible apps face is privacy the data that invisible apps need is highly sensitive and needs to be guarded and treated with immense care best practices regulations and legal precedent are only just emerging for location data and have quite a way to go for all other sensor data like activity altitude and ambient lighting many consumers are hesitant to give apps access to this data because it’s not fully clear how this data will be used and safeguarded which makes developers hesitant to build experiences that require it for invisible apps to become widespread industry associations will need to be formed best practices around privacy will need to be created and all of this will need to be communicated to consumers battery life sensors which are the cornerstone of the invisible app experience have made huge strides with regard to battery efficiency but they still require quite a bit of power what person hasn’t watched their battery drain with alarming speed while they used navigation software the good news is that it is absolutely possible to build services that use gps and other sensors in the background with minimal impact on battery life the bad news is that optimizing how when and which sensors you pull to reduce impact on your battery is nuanced and complex and requires drawn out battery tests that can take many weeks and months to perform this is outside the scope of most development projects for developers and consumers to get comfortable using sensors more regularly and in the background battery optimizations need to be as easy as selecting from within a few options of battery drain versus accuracy api complexity apple and android both provide api access to sensor data on phones however there are literally dozens of apis to learn each functions differently and documentation is incredibly sparse this makes it very difficult for developers to build even simple logic into their apps for instance on android just for location there is geofences passive provider network location provider gps location provider and fused location api which has no power low power balanced power and high accuracy modes each of these behaves differently under different conditions but reading documentation alone won’t make it possible to implement a decent experience you’ll have to spend a lot of time working with each to figure out how to actually achieve what you are trying to build the current hodgepodge of sensor apis requires developers to spend too much time understanding the underlying sensor and the software derivatives ios and android need to simplify their apis and provide better documentation or a layer needs to emerge that simplifies developing on sensors converting raw data into intelligence most of the sensor apis provide raw data such as a latitude and longitude or a string of numbers representing the y axis movement this puts a tremendous onus on the developer to turn sensor data into actionable intelligence to do this well app developers would need to collect hundreds of millions if not billions of data points one of the rare places where android and ios provide meaningful intelligence over raw data is with the activity monitor which lets apps know whether their user is walking driving or running the utopian future where our apps know what we need before we even have to ask is coming at this year’s google io it was revealed that this basic functionality was achieved with between  and  data points to get to anything more interesting than whether someone is walking would require an order of magnitude more data points which is an enormous effort outside the reach of most startups the underlying collection and analysis of sensor data is not something every developer should need to undertake apps need to be able to code against use cases and not against raw sensor data conclusion the utopian future where our apps know what we need before we even have to ask is coming the opportunity is too significant and the megatrends too strong to stop this from happening however there are privacy technical and infrastructure hurdles that must be overcome as well as foundational pieces that need to be built once it is easy to build accurate batteryefficient and privacyfriendly apps with sensor intelligence i believe we will see a huge rush of entirely new apps and experiences that will make us even more productive and more efficient and make our phones even more central to our lives featured image vlueshutterstock image has been modified  shares advertisement advertisement newsletter subscriptions the daily crunch get the top tech

with your app better make it invisible says runkeeper founder jason jacobs by jason jacobs minute readour phones have become an extension of ourselves so much that we get anxiety when we leave them at home nearly  of people worldwide said they couldn’t go a single day without their phone according to time but fewer of us consciously think about the potential for our phones to get to know us just by virtue of being on us all the timeadvertisementin order for phones and wearables to be truly transformative the apps that run on them will need to become invisiblenow wearable technologies like pebble and google glass are changing the way we interact with our phones and how our phones interact with us with these innovations come big opportunities to transform how we go about our lives but in order for phones and wearables to be truly transformative the apps that run on them will need to become invisiblewave one of the app revolution has been a great first step now you can keep track of your daily calorie intake your personal spending against budget find driving directions to your destination and many other functions that help make our lives easier but each of these apps still requires a fair bit of work and as a result many people aren’t sticking with them over time this problem is compounded as more apps proliferate and as people’s overburdened schedules continue to get crazier a shining example is email it is engrained in our business culture as an efficiencydriver but increasingly bogs people down with more and more required actions that disrupt the flow of their workday lots of companies are out trying to tackle the email challenge and make the technology more invisible before people declare email bankruptcy and throw in the towel altogetherthe second wave of the app revolution will be the quest for invisibility invisible apps run passively in the background meaning they are always on collecting data with no action needed to enable them the information that they surface is proactive and timely without you the consumer needing to look for it they leverage many data sources including other apps and the more they know about you the smarter they become as the technology fades into the background and these apps get better at solving everyday problems effectively they will become indispensable across more and more aspects of our lives this quest for invisibility is already in progress google now for instance not only prompts you when it is time to leave for your next meeting but it tells you which route to take given current traffic patterns–without you having to ask uber doesn’t just let you book a taxi from your phone it shows where the car is in realtime as it approaches how many minutes away it is and prompts you as it is arriving so you can head outside just in time square doesn’t just enable merchants to accept credit cards via their phones but also lets you place an order just by saying your name while inside the store while these examples may seem like magic it’s only the beginning as your phone has more sensors in it and more access to integrated external sensors it will continue to know more about you and your surroundings as this occurs the friction involved in using apps will continue to decrease and the proactive insight and value that these apps provide will increase exponentially over timei’m not claiming the robots will take over quite yet but as apps become more invisible we can start to live more productively and get closer to reaching our fullest potentialadvertisement–jason jacobs is the

kleis excellent tactical espionage game snuck onto mobile without being too compromised developer klei entertainment price  version  app reviewed on ipad air  graphicssound rating user interface rating gameplay rating replay value rating overall rating invisible inc is a stealthbased strategy game that creates an amazing sense of tension through its intelligent design and dystopian future aesthetic when the original pc release of the game came out in  it was met with pretty positive fanfare and for the most part the mobile version is just as great spy game invisible inc looks and plays like a lot of turnbased strategy games but with the twist of being stealthbased your team of spies have some impressive skills but their goals dont revolve around killing instead the focus is more on staying out of sight to achieve your goals and resorting to knocking out or killing guards only when it seems absolutely necessary although the stealth focus changes a lot of common approaches taken in strategy games invisible inc still takes cues from a lot of excellent games to make everything click specifically things like xcom enemy withins mission structure dungeon of the endlesss focus on character and a lack of hit percentage stats on attacks like banner saga games are all here in invisible inc the resulting mix makes the game feel immediately familiar while also challenging strategy veterans with its sneaky gameplay your mission if you choose to accept it your mission in invisible inc is to save your decaying ai after being raided by an evil megacorporation the ultimate plan is to locate the enemy headquarters and reupload the ai to their computer system you start off with a team of two spies each with their own unique traits and a few days to gear up for your headquarters infiltration via missions missions all fall into a handful of types like rescuing captured agents or hacking into fabricators to outfit your team with new gear each level is procedurally generated to make sure no two scenarios feel quite the same after completing the game youll earn unlocks like new programs or team members to give you new options to consider in subsequent playthroughs mission compromised in the port from pc to mobile invisible incs gameplay remains completely intact but there are currently a few minor issues with the game on mobile the most prevalent of these issues is that certain visuals seem to disappear from the screen intermittently namely guards as they are being dragged and danger zone indicators neither of these are especially huge deals but with a game thats already as visually dense as invisible inc its noticeable the other issue with invisible inc is its mobile performance although it runs well invisible incs battery usage is incredibly high which is a bit of a bummer considering it is such a perfect game to play on a long flight there are also some long load times in the game but these are infrequent enough that they dont seem especially frustrating the bottom line invisible inc is a fantastic combination of unique and triedandtrue strategy mechanics that feels endlessly replayable the minor technical issues in this mobile version are only slight blemishes on what is otherwise an extremely polished and fun strategy game posted in reviews ipad apps and games ipad games tagged with game strategy review stealth inc invisible xcom klei
