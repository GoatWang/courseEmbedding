   terratechderekpeterson  leave a comment anthony fabrizio biochemical research specialist terra tech corp  anthony fabrizio graduated from the university of san francisco with an undergraduate degree in chemistry with an emphasis in biochemistry upon completion of his undergrad degree fabrizio continued a masters research degree focusing on electron transfer energetics within water and how hydrogenbonding networks are modulated by solvation of simple solutes this research lead to better fundamental understanding of the nobel prize winning theory of electron transfer as well as how it relates to biological systems fabrizio’s first contact with cannabinoids and the endogenous systems which they regulate was as an undergraduate due to his struggle with epilepsy as a patient who was suffering from  seizures a week fabrizio was consulted by a friend to try medical cannabis fabrizio did not act on the consultation for the first few days until his seizure frequency became unbearable fabrizio tried medical cannabis for the first time after  days with no seizures fabrizio took it upon himself to search the scientific literature available to him to verify if academic studies had been conducted in regards to cannabis and epilepsy to his amazement he found many thousands of published articles which addressed cannabis and its effects on not only epilepsy but cancer neurodegenerative disease diabetes cardiovascular disease ptsd autoimmune diseases among many other ailments this finding began fabrizio’s  year journey into researching and understanding cannabis its therapeutically active constituents and their parent systems known as the endocannabinoid and endovanilloid systems which are involved in a plethora of metabolic and biological processes it became obvious quite quickly that the body of scientific literature reveals these chemicals and systems as a treasure chest of research tools into understanding a variety of diseases as well their potential biochemical cause fabrizio’s research culminated in a career path in which fabrizio specializes in extraction techniques and application of research to create targeted cannabinoid and terpene profiles that better fit the needs of each patient and their particular ailment in addition fabrizio acts as a biochemical research consultant as it pertains to cannabinoid and terpenoidbased therapeutic applications in california nevada and most recently florida terra tech introduces ivxx ™ – a new brand of premium quality locallyproduced cannabis december  december    terratechderekpeterson  leave a
