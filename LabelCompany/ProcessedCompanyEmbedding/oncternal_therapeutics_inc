target was ewsfli which is only found in ewing sarcoma tumor cells and has been called undruggable now tk demonstrates that not only is ewsfli druggable but that the potential of tk inhibiting a

etsfamily transcription factor inhibitor tk is a small molecule that inhibits the biological activity of etsfamily transcription factor oncoproteins in a variety of tumor types stopping cancer cell growth and tumor formation following the successful filing of an investigational new drug ind application in the us we are opening a phase  study of tk to begin in the second quarter of  in patients with relapsed ewing sarcoma es a rare bone cancer that strikes children and young adults with a typical onset between 0 and  years of age targeting known oncogenes the etstranscription factor family includes four members implicated as oncogenes or genes that have been identified as initiators of cancer while they are active in embryogenesis the etsfamily transcription factor proteins are not commonly expressed after birth presenting an ideal target for researchers hoping to exclusively affect cancer cell growth in ewing sarcoma es the cancer is caused by a single and wellcharacterized genetic mutation that leads to a chimeric ets protein which enables patients to be easily identified with dnabased testing the etsfamily transcription factor proteins are also expressed in various other cancers including acute myeloid leukemia glioblastoma and prostate cancer ewing sarcoma has high unmet medical need we are initially advancing tk in development for es because of the tremendous need for new targeted therapies for this devastating disease and the hope that it can be made available for patients with an expedited approval pathway in the last  years no new therapies have been approved specifically for es despite advances in chemotherapy and local control measures many patients have very poor outcomes we are planning subsequent studies to investigate tk in patients with other cancers whose tumors carry mutant or overexpressed levels of etsfamily oncogenes collaboration with georgetown university tk was developed based on the discoveries of jeff a toretsky md at georgetown university who identified a small molecule that was shown to kill ewing sarcoma cells and inhibit growth of tumors in preclinical studies oncternal scientists developed and tested a large series of derivatives of the research molecule and after extensive evaluation tk was selected as our lead product candidate tk has been extensively evaluated in preclinical studies where it has been shown to kill es cells we continue to collaborate with dr toretsky and his colleagues in order to advance the research underlying the molecular pathways of tk and optimize its development across multiple tumor types we are recruiting patients with cll for a phase  study of cirmtuzumab our antiror monoclonal antibody with ewing sarcoma for a phase  study of tk our small molecule inhibitor of

humanized mab to ror cirmtuzumab is a humanized igg monoclonal antibody designed and developed to bind with high affinity to a biologically important epitope on the extracellular domain of receptortyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor  ror cirmtuzumab is currently being tested in a phase  trial for patients with relapsedrefractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll the most common form of leukemia in adults that contributes to approximately  us deaths annually we’re also working to rapidly advance cirmtuzumab into additional clinical trials to bring forward this novel therapeutic to patients with other types of cancer ror is a marker for many cancers ror is a type  transmembrane protein expressed on the plasma membrane with an extracellular domain that is essential for ligand binding and signal transduction this novel target is highly expressed in many hematologic malignancies including cll and mantle cell lymphoma mcl as well as by a number of solid tumors including lung ovarian and triplenegative breast cancer binding of cirmtuzumab to ror on tumor cells inhibits wnta signaling a pathway important for blocking tumorcell proliferation migration and survival blocked wnta signaling leads to tumor cell death by apoptosis unmet need in cll cll is the most common type of leukemia in adults with approximately  new cases diagnosed per year in the us a diagnosis of cll has been shown to shorten the life expectancy of all patients and the disease is not curable with standard therapies while many patients can live with cll for years there remains a strong need for therapies to manage cll particularly in patients with advanced disease who may face rapid progression and a median survival of not more than  years as a highly targeted firstinclass therapy cirmtuzumab has the potential to be used either alone or in combination to treat cll and other cancers where ror is expressed collaboration with university of california san diego cirmtuzumab was

to see our discovery research and early clinical development program trigger the formation of a new biotechnology company in san diego led by an experienced leadership team the scientific work done by dr kipps and his colleagues has been extraordinary and holds great promise to generate a new wave of firstinclass targeted cancer therapies said david f hale chairman of oncternal therapeutics  we are excited to build a worldclass company focused on the development of these promising ror programs which feature novel science and a strong intellectual property portfolio that we plan to enhance in the future  we look forward to rapidly advancing cirmtuzumab into additional clinical trials and bringing forward novel therapeutics for the treatment of patients with these devastating diseases the antiror monoclonal antibody cirmtuzumab was developed at uc san diego by dr kipps with funding from the us national institutes of health the california institute for regenerative medicine cirm and the blood cancer research fund  cirmtuzumab is currently being tested in a phase  clinical trial for patients with relapsedrefractory cll  studies have shown that ror is expressed by a number of hematologic malignancies as well as by a number of solid tumors creating a treatment that will help patients is not just a matter of good scientific work its also a matter of good business planning and leadership this agreement brings those two elements together says c randal mills president and ceo of cirm  we are hopeful this alliance will help accelerate the progress of dr kipps research and we congratulate him and his team at uc san diego oncternal will also continue development of several preclinical development programs initiated by uc san diego including potential rordirected adcs with early evidence of promising antitumor efficacy and specificity and several potential cart vectors which can be introduced into a cancer patients tcells enabling the cells to recognize and kill tumor cells that express ror  oncternal therapeutics intends to continue the development of the cart program in collaboration with the moores cancer center  one of our missions as a public university is to translate our research into public benefit said paul roben associate vice chancellor for innovation at uc san diego this successful collaboration exemplifies that commitment to social responsibility cirmtuzumab cirmtuzumab is a humanized igg monoclonal antibody that was designed and developed to bind with high affinity to a biologically important epitope on the extracellular domain of ror binding of cirmtuzumab to ror on tumor cells inhibits wnta signalling a pathway that is important for tumorcell proliferation migration and survival blockade of this wnta signaling leads to tumor cell death by apoptosis about rorreceptortyrosine kinaselike orphan receptor  – also known as ror  is a type  transmembrane protein that is expressed on the plasma membrane with an extracellular domain that is essential for ligand binding and signal transduction  highlevel expression of ror has been found in many cancers  the highest and most consistent expression of the ror protein is in mantle cell lymphoma mcl where virtually all patient samples express ror and cll where 9 percent express ror on the cell surface  ror is also expressed at high frequency in many solid tumors including lung and ovarian cancers as well as triplenegative breast cancer about oncternal therapeuticsoncternal therapeutics has been formed around the groundbreaking research at uc san diego of dr thomas kipps on the ror signaling system and the development of antibodies and related binding agents to treat rorexpressing cancers  the oncternal leadership team has extensive experience in the formation and successful development of biotechnology companies and innovative pharmaceutical products  the founders and initial board members include david f hale cam garner scott glenn and james b breitmeyer who have been involved in founding andor development of a number of life sciences companies in san diego  hale and garner were members of the senior management team of hybritech with its subsequent sale to eli lilly and company  one or more of the founders have had key roles with gensia dura cancervax santarus skinmedica quidel dexcom neurelis cadence evoke pharma zogenix and a number of other
