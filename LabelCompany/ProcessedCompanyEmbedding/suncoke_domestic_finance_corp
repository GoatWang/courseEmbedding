breach of fiduciary duty by directors these provisions do not alter a director’s liability under federal securities laws the inclusion of this provision in our amended and restated certificate of

otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders indemnification our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to
