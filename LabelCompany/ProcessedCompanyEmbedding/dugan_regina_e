object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

of the defense advanced research projects agency better known as darpa — she was the agency’s first female leader zynga’s press release highlights a bunch of mediarelated honors as well but i’m partial to reporter liz gannes’ complimentary description “google’s regina dugan is a badass” the appointment follows the departure of linkedin cofounder reid hoffman and dreamworks animation ceo jeffrey katzenberg from zynga’s board last month those departures meant that zynga was no longer in compliance with a nasdaq listing rule that required boards to have a majority of independent directors as noted in a regulatory filing with dugan’s appointment zynga should be compliant again there are now five independent directors dugan stanley j meresman sunil paul ellen f smirnoff and john doerr who is now the lead independent director the other board members are founder and chairman mark pincus bing gordon and mattrick dugan will chair the board’s nominating and governance committee and will also be a member of the product committee in the release she said i believe we need to play zynga is full of creative thinkers who embrace the power of play einstein famously stated that ‘combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought’ and this spirit is embodied in zynga’s products which have brought new technology to games games that help people connect share rest and energize through play i look forward to working with don and the board on the company’s next chapter despite some highprofile struggles and layoffs zynga actually came in slightly ahead of analyst estimates in its most recent earnings report at the time it also announced that pincus who was replaced by mattrick as ceo last year would be stepping down from an operational role at the company update you can see the regulatory filing related to dugan’s appointment here the filing also mentions mattrick vesting stock as a result of his first anniversary at the

are leaps versus incremental steps seattlebased wireless analyst chetan sharma recently told technology review in a new york times article titled new force behind agency of wonder john markoff noted that dugan is credited with having a knack for inspiring and indeed insisting on creative thinking darpa is often discussed as a place of innovation which was addressed during a washington post live

the nano hummingbird a miniature flying robot with a camera that can transmit live video by adam l penenberglong readin august a hypersonic military plane flying at  times the speed of sound vanished into the pacific ocean nine minutes after launching from vandenberg air force base in lompoc california the unmanned flight was an experiment conducted by darpa the defense advanced research projects agency a defense department division responsible for the development of new military technology the plane cost millions to build and this was the second time in two years this kind of craft had been lost yet regina dugan darpa’s coolblooded director was not overly vexed “you can’t lose your nerve for the big failure because you need exactly the same nerve for the big success” dugan had earlier told fast company during a minute interview at darpa headquarters in arlington virginiaadvertisementblistering speed and big splashes–in the pacific and at the pentagon–have characterized the yearold dugan’s tenure as darpa director the first woman to hold the role dugan has invigorated the agency whose inventions led to computer networking and gps among other technologies that have had transformative impact on civilian life with initiatives that may fundamentally change the way the military innovates she has centered darpa’s focus on the intersection of basic and applied research she is so focused on speeding up the time from bluesky idea to delivery of product that she has embraced crowdsourcing for both idea creation and manufacturing turning to the masses may seem antithetical to military secrecy but dugan’s unorthodox approach fits with another goal of hers welcoming a wider array of smaller contractors to bid for darpa projects including aerovironment which fabricated the nano hummingbirds on the previous page in the minisociety known as the military industrial complex none of this is simple or uncontroversial earlier this year it was revealed that darpa had awarded a private defense firm that dugan founded with her father and uncle  million in contracts over the past several years including  million since she became agency director her former firm in which she still holds a hefty stake also owes her  for a loan she made dugan says she properly recused herself from all related decisions “there’s nothing more important to me personally than ethics” she told fast company but critics worry that her influence played a role the department of defense’s inspector general is investigatingwhile her past is attracting attention dugan is firmly focused on the future she shuns the spotlight so much so that she requested through her deputies that fast company not run this story as an interview fearing that an undue focus on her would diminish the accomplishments of her program managers in whose ranks she dwelled several years ago it’s clear that dugan’s ambition for darpa is limitless her vision audacious but the question remains will she succeed or will her agenda–like that hypersonic vehicle–crash and burn like a shortlived experimentfc so dr dugan when did you first realize you were good at math and science back in advanced calculus class in high school whenever i would speak the other students would make computer sounds in the back of the room bleeping and fussing whirring all kinds of sounds at moments like that i thought hmm there’s something different here advertisementdid you play sports i did my father had three girls we were very close in age and he coached us all in softball he always had two of us who were split in the age groups so i got him every other year as a coach i played third base–and i was a catcher for a while which i loved you’re in every play and you get really dirtywhat attracted you to engineeringadvertisement for a while in high school i thought i would be an architect because i liked the combination of technical discipline with the creative side of architecture i was curious about everything pulled in all directions by different subjects but then i figured out that engineering could be every bit as creative as architectureyou went to virginia tech and got your master’s there then whati went to nasa i actually got my first patent at nasa for a system designed to refuel satellites in orbitadvertisementdid any of that technology work its way into launcheswe did quite a bit of testing and it might have been successful had time not passed it just never came about because the need wasn’t there refreshing the electronics became more important than refuelingwas there a lesson there perhaps in the amount of time it takes for innovations to work their way into the product sideadvertisementi had left nasa by the time they made these decisions so i don’t know the specifics but i do think that speed is part of the innovation process if ideas aren’t built on with a sense of urgency time can pass you bythis isn’t just a problem for the government it’s a problem for everyone the difficulty of making new ideas broadly available and yet some ideas move quickly look at the progression of radio television the internet the ipod facebook the acceleration in getting to millions of users has gone from  years to less than  that’s something that we’ve paid a lot of attention to how do we increase the speed at darpa that seems a key part of your mission since you got here–that it’s not enough to be doing cuttingedge researchadvertisementwhen deputy director kaigham gabriel and i got here we understood that darpa is one of the gems of the nation we had been asked to take good care of her for me part of that meant really understanding why darpa has this halfcentury of success in innovation and the first element in darpa’s success is the power that lies at the intersection of basic science and application in the socalled pasteur’s quadrant do you know stokes’s theory of innovationabsolutely notdonald e stokes wrote a theory of innovation in the late s till then most people thought of innovation as a linear process you do basic science then you do more advanced science then you do the application work then you commercialize it what stokes suggested is that it doesn’t happen that way at all he preferred to think of it in a quadrant fashion defining one row as very deep science and the other as light science the two columns were a lowapplication drive and a highapplication drive pasteur’s quadrant happens at the deepscience highapplicationdrive quadrant that’s darpa’s absolute power lane it’s called pasteur’s quadrant because serious concerns about food safety drove his research photo by douglas sondersa very recent example of how it works for us is the blastgauge work that we do here’s a big problem tbi traumatic brain injuries so the way we approach it at darpa is to say “okay let’s understand the basic science the phenomenology how is it that an encounter with a blast injures the brain what levels of blasts cause what levels of injury is it the overpressure is it the acceleration what is it” a medical person from darpa researched this and discovered it was the overpressure and the darpa physicist says “we know how to measure that” together they devise this little blast gauge that’s the size of a couple stacks of quarters the gauge helps doctors measure a soldier’s blastexposure level enabling better assessment of injuries they develop it in one year going through four iterations of the electronics that’s fastadvertisementall of this leads back to the idea of shipping products the defense world is like a minisociety it has to deploy to anyplace in the world on a moment’s notice and it has to work in a lifeordeath situation that kind of focus that kind of drive to ship an application really does inspire greater genius and the constancy of funding that comes with that–in good times or bad whether this party or that party is in power–also helps inspire innovation you’ve introduced a number of projects that seem to be designed to speed up and open up innovation at darpato increase the speed of innovation here we want to increase the number of people who can contribute ideas to the creative process we’re trying to get that going with things like the adaptive vehicle make program the accelerated manufacture of pharmaceuticals and a whole host of spaceprogram projects then there’s also how we engage with the scientific and business communities we structure programs so that we can have diversity of involvement from universities to small businesses to large businesses to garage inventors you’re looking for the maximum number of folks who can contribute ideas to the process so we’re trying to catalyze and grab the best ideas no matter where they come from leveraging the most modern concepts of crowdsourcing and harnessing creative power look at the semiconductor industry those companies could only keep up with moore’s law by going from hundreds of chip designers focused on eking out every last electron to hundreds of thousands of designers throughout the industry who could excel at various pieces of the design when you open up the process like that the number of people and the diversity of people who can participate goes way upadvertisement jay rogers ceo of local motors left and darpa’s nathan wiedenman look on as dugan shakes president barack obama’s hand the xcv behind a combat test vehicle designed through crowdsourcing was unveiled at carnegie mellon university in june  photo by douglas sondersdarpa is known for top top secret technologies yet with some of these crowdsourcing experiments see turning to the crowd you are transparently setting up websites where anyone can upload a video of their experiment how do you reconcile these two opposing ideaswe have to do both i’m sure you’re familiar with james surowiecki’s book the wisdom of crowds he has this great story of francis galton’s visit to a livestock show in  galton’s motive was to show that the average person wasn’t very smart his basic theory was we should leave government to the smart few and not to the masses so he came upon this contest to guess the weight of a butchered and dressed ox and what he discovered quite to his frustration was that the crowd was in fact exceedingly smart the mean as predicted by the crowd was  pounds and the actual weight was  pounds it was a profound outcome when former secretary of defense robert gates and his deputy interviewed you did they ask how you’d change darpa or is it the case that you were appointed and then made decisions on how best to proceedadvertisementwhen i first arrived there was a lot of debate about whether the agency would get pulled more in the direction of basic science or more toward applied research obviously i consider that a false choice probably the single biggest reason that i came back to serve here was that i believed lack of adaptability is a vulnerability in and of itself this is something that has to be addressed specifically the ability to adaptso getting your employees to buy in is a huge deal tell me about your first days on the jobi decided that i had to meet every single person in the agency at that time there were –i know the number precisely so i did it in backtoback minute meetings the deputy director and i met everyone advertisementwhat did you get out of thatit was valuable to me disproportionate to my expectations these are the musicians in this darpa orchestra that sounds like a crazy few weeksadvertisementyes but that was only the first step the next was to understand the portfolio of projects and that was as awesome a task as meeting everyone and it takes even longerare you always a tohouraweek worker the first year and the second have been at a really crushing pace but that kind of intensity is important i tell young people who ask me about their careers “wake up on saturday and ask yourself which job would i go to right now then choose that one” because what it tells you is that you’re going to your passion your passion is your work and i feel that way about my work advertisementturning to the crowdthree programs that are accelerating under dugan’s

crew of unconventional players including hackers hobbyists and independent researchers while cutting bureaucratic red tape developers retain intellectualproperty rights uavforgedarpa is crowdsourcing the design and construction of a portable backpacksize unmanned aerial vehicle to fly into “critical environments” and conduct surveillance teams of inventors post their plans to a darpa website where the crowd can weigh in with suggestions top teams are invited to demo their tech at a “flyoff” where the winning group will receive  a darpa subcontractor will build prototypes that the inventors can demonstrate in a warfighter exercisesystem fthis crowdsourced approach to spaceworthy hardware and software started three years ago with the goal of restructuring the way satellites which run a minimum of  million to launch are built instead of constructing a satellite as one big project the idea is to break it into constituent pieces that can be built by different vendors of all sizes and specialties then each piece could be launched separately until all the parts join up in a virtual satellite formation in orbit flying for the duration of the mission and talking to each other
