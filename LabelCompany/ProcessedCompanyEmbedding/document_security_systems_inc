your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first

ebitdathe company uses adjusted ebitda as a nongaap financial performance measurement adjusted ebitda is calculated by the company by adding back to net income loss interest income taxes depreciation and amortization expense as further adjusted to add back stockbased compensation expense and nonrecurring items and impairments of investments and intangible assets adjusted ebitda is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with gaap management believes that adjusted ebitda provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing its financial results with other companies in the industry many of which also use adjusted ebitda in their communications to investors by excluding noncash charges such as amortization depreciation stockbased compensation and impairment charges as well as nonoperating charges for interest and income taxes investors can evaluate the companys operations and its ability to generate cash flows from operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in the industry management also uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate potential acquisitions establish internal budgets and goals and evaluate performance of its business units and management the company considers adjusted ebitda to be an important indicator of the companys operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the companys historical and prospective operating trends however there are significant limitations to the use of adjusted ebitda since it excludes interest income and expense and income taxes and nonrecurring items all of which impact the companys profitability and operating cash flows as well as depreciation amortization impairment charges and stockbased compensation the company believes that these limitations are compensated by clearly identifying the difference between the two measures consequently adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and loss presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda as defined by the company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities the following is a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda loss   three months ended march     change unaudited unaudited net loss                                  add backs
