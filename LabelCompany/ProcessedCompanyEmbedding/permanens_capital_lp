allocation must be customized for each client  no two clients are the same endowment allocators should have direct investment experience manager fees should be low cost and nonconflicted clients should avoid comingled asset exposure whenever possible conventional benchmarks often create pressure to conform and may add unintended risks investors have sacrificed liquidity and overpaid for mediocre investment performance permanens capital creates customized investment governances and asset allocations that match client operating risks and cash flows utilizing a combination of inexpensive etfs funds and customized sector portfolios permanens seeks to construct the lowest cost and most liquid custom portfolio for each client permanens aggregates client allocations to achieve institutional lowest fee structures the permanens approach allocators frequently first find managers then evaluate fees and terms and lastly evaluate strategy permanens starts with an asset class then finds the most appropriate liquid lowest fee exposure we utilize customized subadvised portfolios etfs mutual funds and hedge funds no active stock selection limited use of hedge funds mostly for more complex assets avoid private wealth management execution costs and slippage minimize nontraditional risks custody commingling   permanens capital all rights reserved home      contact us
