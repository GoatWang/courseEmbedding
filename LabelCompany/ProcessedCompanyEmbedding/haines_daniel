the undergraduate design projects program category and requests support for undergraduate and graduate student engineers to provide prototype custom designed devices and software to aid persons with disabilities the primary goal of this thrust is to provide meaningful design experience for the engineering student that will directly aid a specific disabled individual a formal program is in place at manhattan college which will ensure satisfactory progress is attained on these projects a group of students and the investigators on the grant will work with a number of collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects forty projects are planned during the three year duration of this award and a written report on the completed projects will be submitted for an annual publication once completed each project will be given to the person for whom it is designed the hope is that this real world experience will give engineering students a sense of purpose and pride help engineering schools serve the community attract new students into engineering and raise student interest in graduate education this type of undertaking is important since it provides a meaningful experience for engineering students as part of their undergraduate design requirements and will also benefit a population where customization is often needed for rehabilitation devices    funding agency

uncovers the history of one of the most important factors in relations between these two south asian powers  water a new approach that contextualizes the indus conflict in terms of decolonization and cold war policies emphasizes how critical the indus basin river system is to both india and pakistan and how the treaty failed to resolve all conflict rivers divided indus basin waters in the making of india and pakistan daniel haines description the indus waters treaty is considered a key example of indiapakistan cooperation but less has been said about its critical influence on statemaking in both countries rivers divided reveals the importance of the indus basin river system and thus control over it for indian and pakistani claims to sovereignty after south asias partition in  securing water flows was a key aim for both governments in  the indus waters treaty ostensibly settled the dispute but in fact failed to address critical sources of tension examples include the role of water in the kashmir conflict and the riverine geography of punjabs militarised border zone despite the recent resurgence of disputes over watersharing in south asia the historical causes and consequences of the regions flagship natural resources treaty remain little understood based on new research in south asia the united states and united kingdom this book places the indus dispute for the first time in the context of decolonisation and cold warera development politics it examines the discord at local national and international levels arguing that we can only explain its importance and longevity
