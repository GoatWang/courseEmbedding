california in bank jan 4  page           pd   cald  reed brockway  ruffin and william f reed san diego for plaintiff and appellant         holt macomber graham  baugh and william h macomber san diego for defendant and appellant         moss lyon  dunn gerold c dunn and henry f walker los angeles as amici curiae on behalf of defendant and appellant         no appearance for defendant and respondent         traynor justice         plaintiff brought this action for damages against the retailer and the manufacturer of a shopsmith a combination power tool that could be used as a saw drill and wood lathe he saw a shopsmith demonstrated by the retailer and studied a brochure prepared by the manufacturer he decided he wanted a shopsmith for his home workshop and his wife bought and gave him one for christmas in  in  he bought the necessary attachments to use the shopsmith as a lathe for turning a large piece of wood he wished to make into a chalice after he had worked on the piece of wood several times without difficulty it suddenly flew out of the machine and struck him on the forehead inflicting serious injuries about ten and a half months later he gave the retailer and the manufacturer written notice of claimed breaches of warranties and filed a complaint against them alleging such breaches and negligence         after a trial before a jury the court ruled that there was no evidence that the retailer was negligent or had breached any express warranty and that the manufacturer was not liable for the breach of any implied page   pd 8 warranty accordingly it submitted to the jury only the cause of action alleging breach of implied warranties against the retailer and the causes of action alleging negligence and breach of express warranties against the manufacturer the jury returned a verdict for the retailer against plaintiff and for plaintiff against the manufacturer in the amount of  the trial court denied the manufacturers motion for a new trial and  cald  entered judgment on the verdict the manufacturer and plaintiff appeal plaintiff seeks a reversal of the part of the judgment in favor of the retailer however only in the event that the part of the judgment against the manufacturer is reversed         plaintiff introduced substantial evidence that his injuries were caused by defective design and construction of the shopsmith his expert witnesses testified that inadequate set screws were used to hold parts of the machine together so that normal vibration caused the tailstock of the lathe to move away from the piece of wood being turned permitting it to fly out of the lathe they also testified that there were other more positive ways of fastening the parts of the machine together the use of which would have prevented the accident the jury could therefore reasonably have concluded that the manufacturer negligently constructed the shopsmith the jury could also reasonably have concluded that statements in the manufacturers brochure were untrue that they constituted express warranties  and that plaintiffs injuries were caused by their breach         the manufacturer contends however that plaintiff did not give it notice of breach of warranty within a reasonable time and that therefore his cause of action for breach of warranty is barred by section  of the civil code since it cannot be determined whether the verdict against it was based on the negligence or warranty cause of action or both the manufacturer concludes that the error in presenting the warranty cause of action to the jury was prejudicial         section  of the civil code provides in the absence of express or implied agreement of the parties acceptance of the goods by the buyer shall not discharge the seller from liability in damages or other legal remedy for breach of any promise or warranty in the contract to sell or the sale but if after acceptance of the goods the buyer fails to give notice to the seller of the breach of any promise or warranty within a reasonable time after the buyer knows or ought to know of such breach the seller shall not be liable therefor         like other provisions of the uniform sales act civcode cald  §§ 8 section  deals with the rights of the parties to a contract of sale or a sale it does not provide that notice must be given of the breach of a warranty that arises independently of a contract of sale between the parties such warranties are not imposed by the sales act but are the product of commonlaw decisions that have recognized them in a variety of situations see gagne v bertran 4 cald    pd  and authorities cited peterson v lamb rubber co 4 cald    calrptr 8  pd  klein v duchess sandwich co ltd  cald  8  pd  burr v sherwin williams co 4 cald 8  8 pd 4 souza  mccue constr co v superior court  cald 8   calrptr 4  pd 8 it is true that in many of these situations the court has invoked the sales act definitions of warranties civcode §§   in defining the defendants liability but it has done so not because the statutes so required but because they provided appropriate standards for the page   pd  court to adopt under the circumstances presented see clinkscales v carver  cald    pd  dana v sutton motor sales  cald  8  calrptr   pd 88         the notice requirement of section  however is not an appropriate one for the court to adopt in actions by injured consumers against manufacturers with whom they have not dealt la hue v cocacola bottling  washd 4  pd 4 4 chapman v brown dc 8 fsupp  8 affd brown v chapman  cir 4 fd  as between the immediate parties to the sale the notice requirement is a sound commercial rule designed to protect the seller against unduly delayed claims for damages as applied to personal injuries and notice to a remote seller it becomes a boobytrap for the unwary the injured consumer is seldom steeped in the business practice which justifies the rule james product liability 4 texas lrev    and at least until he has had legal advice it will not occur to him to give notice to one with whom he has had no dealings prosser strict liability to the consumer  yale lj   footnotes omitted it is true that in jones v burgermeister brewing corp 8 calappd 8  8 calrptr  perry v thrifty drug co 8 calappd 4 4  calrptr  arata v tonegato  calappd 8   pd  and maecherlein v  cald  sealy mattress co  calappd    pd  the court assumed that notice of breach of warranty must be given in an action by a consumer against a manufacturer since in those cases however the court did not consider the question whether a distinction exists between a warranty based on a contract between the parties and one imposed on a manufacturer not in privity with the consumer the decisions are not authority for rejecting the rule of the la hue and chapman cases supra peterson v lamb rubber co 4 cald  4  calrptr 8  pd  people v banks  cald  8  calrptr   pd  we conclude therefore the even if plaintiff did not give timely notice of breach of warranty to the manufacturer his cause of action based on the representations contained in the brochure was not barred         moreover to impose strict liability on the manufacturer under the circumstances of this case it was not necessary for plaintiff to establish an express warranty as defined in section  of the civil code  a manufacturer is strictly liable in tort when an article he places on the market knowing that it is to be used without inspection for defects proves to have a defect that causes injury to a human being recognized first in the case of unwholesome food products such liability has now been extended to a variety of other products that create as great or greater hazards if defective peterson v lamb rubber co 4 cald  4  calrptr 8  pd  grinding

corporation dc 8 fsupp   airplane         although in these cases strict liability has usually been based on the theory of an express or implied warranty running from the manufacturer to the plaintiff the abandonment of the requirement of a contract between them the recognition that the liability is not assumed by agreement but imposed by law see e g graham v bottenfields inc  kan 8  pd 4 48 rogers v toni home permanent co  ohio st   ned    alrd  decker  sons inc v capps  tex   4 swd 88  alr  and the refusal to permit the manufacturer to define the scope of its own responsibility for defective

inc  njsuper 4 4 ad   linn v radio center delicatessen  misc 8  nysd   make clear that the liability is not one governed by the law of contract warranties but by the law of strict liability in tort accordingly rules defining and governing warranties that were developed to meet the needs of commercial transactions cannot properly be invoked to govern the manufacturers liability to those injured by their defective products unless those rules also serve the purposes for which such liability is imposed         we need not recanvass the reasons for imposing strict liability on the manufacturer they have been fully articulated in the cases cited above see also  harper and james torts §§ 88 pp 4 prosser strict liability to the consumer  yale lj  escola v coca cola bottling co 4 cald 4 4  pd 4 concurring opinion the purpose of such liability is to insure that the costs of injuries resulting from defective products are borne by the manufacturers that put such products on the market rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to protect themselves sales warranties serve this purpose  cald 4 fitfully at best see prosser strict liability to the consumer  yale lj   in the present case for example plaintiff was able to plead and prove an express warranty only because he read and relied on the representations of the shopsmiths ruggedness contained in the manufacturers brochure implicit in the machines presence on the market however was a representation that it would safely do the jobs for which it was built under these circumstances it should not be controlling whether plaintiff selected the machine because of the statements in the brochure or because of the machines own appearance of excellence that belied the defect lurking beneath the surface or because he merely assumed that it would safely do the jobs it was built to do it should not be controlling whether the details of the sales from manufacturer to retailer and from retailer to plaintiffs wife were such that one or more of the implied warranties of the sales act arose civcode §  the remedies of injured consumers ought not to be made to depend upon the intricacies of the law of sales ketterer v armour  co dc  f   klein v duchess sandwich which co  cald  8  pd  to establish the manufacturers liability it was sufficient that plaintiff proved that he was injured while using the shopsmith in a way it was intended to be used as a result of a defect in design and manufacture of which plaintiff was not aware that made the shopsmith unsafe for its intended use         the manufacturer contends that the trial court erred in refusing to give three page   pd  instructions requested by it it appears from the record however that the substance of two of the requested instructions was adequately covered by the instructions given and that the third instruction was not supported by the evidence         the judgment is affirmed         gibson c j and schauer mccomb peters tobriner and peek jj concur   in this respect the trial court limited the jury to a consideration of two statements in the manufacturers brochure  when shopsmith is in horrizontal position rugged construction of frame provides rigid support from end to end heavy centerlessground steel tubing insurers perfect alignment of components  shopsmith maintains its accuracy because every component has positive locks that hold adjustments through rough or precision work  any affirmation of fact or any promise by the seller relating to the goods is an express warranty if the natural tendency of such affirmation or promise is to induce the buyer to purchase the goods and if the buyer purchases the goods relying thereon no affirmation of the value of the goods nor any statement purporting to be a statement of the sellers opinion only shall be construed as a warranty close case information last updated february   decision date 4 citations  cald   pd   calrptr  jurisdiction supreme court of california author
