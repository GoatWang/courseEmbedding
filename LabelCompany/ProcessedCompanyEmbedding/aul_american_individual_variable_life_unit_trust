conjunction with the detailed information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus unless otherwise indicated the description of the policy in this prospectus assumes that the policy is in force that the last survivor rider is not in force and that there are no outstanding loans and loan interests the policy is similar in many ways to fixedbenefit life insurance as with fixedbenefit life insurance typically the owner of a policy pays premium payments for insurance coverage on the insured also like fixedbenefit life insurance the policy provides for accumulation of premiums and a net cash value that is payable if the policy is surrendered during the insureds lifetime as with fixedbenefit life insurance the net cash value during the early policy years is likely to be lower than the premium payments paid however the policy differs from fixedbenefit life insurance in several important respects unlike fixedbenefit life insurance the death benefit may and the account value will increase or decrease to reflect the investment performance of the investment accounts to which account value is allocated also there is no guaranteed minimum net cash value if the net cash value is insufficient to pay the monthly deduction the policy will lapse without value after a grace period see premium payments to prevent lapse if a policy lapses while loans are outstanding adverse tax consequences may

and whether loan interest was paid when due withdrawals or loans may have an adverse effect on policy benefits risks of life insurance retirement plans using your policy as a funding vehicle for retirement income purposes presents several risks including the risk that if your policy is insufficiently funded in relation to the income stream expected from your policy your policy can lapse prematurely and result in significant income tax liability to you in the year in which the lapse occurs other risks associated with borrowing from your policy also apply loans will be automatically repaid from the gross death benefit at the death of the insured resulting in the estimated payment to the beneficiary of the net death benefit which will be less than the gross death benefit and may be less than the face amount upon surrender the loan will be automatically repaid resulting in the payment to you of the net cash value similarly upon lapse the loan will be automatically repaid the automatic repayment of the loan upon lapse or surrender will cause the recognition of taxable income to the extent that net cash value plus the amount of the repaid loan exceeds your basis in the policy thus under certain circumstances surrender or lapse of your policy could result in tax liability to you in addition to reinstate a lapsed policy you would be required to make certain payments thus you should be careful to fashion a life insurance retirement plan so that your policy will not lapse prematurely under various market scenarios as a result of withdrawals and loans taken from your policy to avoid lapse of your policy it is important to fashion a payment stream that does not leave your policy with insufficient net cash value determinations as to the amount to withdraw or borrow each year warrant careful consideration careful consideration should also be given to any assumptions respecting the hypothetical rate of return to the duration of withdrawals and loans and to the amount of account value that should remain in your policy upon its maturity poor investment performance can contribute to the risk that your policy may lapse in addition the cost of insurance generally increases with the age of the insured which can further erode existing net cash value and contribute to the risk of lapse pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th further interest on a

begin accruing thereon from that date this can have a compounding effect and to the extent that the outstanding loan balance exceeds your basis in the policy the amounts attributable to interest due on the loans can add to your federal and possibly state income tax liability you should consult with your financial and tax advisers in designing a life insurance retirement plan that is suitable further you should continue to monitor the net cash value remaining in a policy to assure that the policy is sufficiently funded to continue to support the desired income stream and so that it will

existing account value or the effect of future withdrawals or loans upon the policys account value and death benefit are available from your representative consideration should be given periodically

contract the home office tax considerations the following summary provides a general description of the federal income tax considerations associated with the policy and does not purport to be complete or to cover all situations this discussion is not intended as tax advice counsel or other competent tax advisers should be consulted for more complete information this discussion is based upon auls understanding of the present federal tax laws as they currently are interpreted by the internal revenue service the irs tax status of the policy in order to attain the tax benefits normally associated with life insurance the policy must be classified for federal income tax purposes as a life insurance contract section  of the internal revenue code sets forth a definition of a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes the us treasury department the treasury is authorized to prescribe regulations implementing section  while proposed regulations and other interim guidance has been issued final regulations have not been adopted in short guidance as to how section  is to be applied is limited if a policy were determined not to be a life insurance contract for purposes of section  such policy would not provide the tax advantages normally provided by a life insurance contract pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th with respect to a policy issued on a standard basis aul believes that such a policy should meet the section  definition of a life insurance contract with respect to a policy that is issued on a substandard basis ie a premium class with extra rating involving higher than standard mortality risk there is less guidance in particular as to how the mortality and other expense requirements of section  are to be applied in determining whether such a policy meets the section  definition of a life insurance contract if the requirements of section  were deemed not to have been met the policy would not provide the tax benefits normally associated with life insurance and the tax status of all contracts invested in the investment account to which premiums were allocated under the nonqualifying contract might be affected if it is subsequently determined that a policy does not satisfy section  aul may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to attempt to cause such a policy to comply with section  for these reasons aul reserves the right to modify the policy it deems in its sole discretion as necessary to attempt to qualify it as a life insurance contract under section  section h of the internal revenue code requires that the investments of each of the investment accounts must be adequately diversified in accordance with treasury regulations in order for the policy to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the internal revenue code the investment accounts through the portfolios intend to comply with the diversification requirements prescribed in treas reg section  which affect how the portfolios assets are to be invested aul believes that the investment accounts will meet the diversification requirements and aul will monitor continued compliance with this requirement in certain circumstances owners of variable life insurance contracts may be considered the owners for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the investment accounts used to support their contracts in those circumstances income and gains from the investment account assets would be includable in the variable contract owners gross income the irs has stated in published rulings that a variable contract owner will be considered the owner of investment account assets if the contract owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets the treasury has also announced in connection with the issuance of regulations concerning diversification that those regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor ie the owner rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account this announcement also stated that guidance would be issued by way of regulations or rulings on the extent to which contract holders may direct their investments to particular investment accounts without being treated as owners of the underlying assets the ownership rights under the policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described by the irs in rulings in which it was determined that contract owners were not owners of investment account assets for example an owner has additional flexibility in allocating premium payments and account value these differences could result in an owner being treated as the owner of a prorata portion of the assets of the investment accounts in addition aul does not know what standards will be set forth if any in the regulations or rulings which the treasury has stated it expects to issue aul therefore reserves the right to modify the policy as necessary to attempt to prevent an owner from being considered the owner of a prorata share of the assets of the investment accounts pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st the following discussion assumes that the policy will qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes tax treatment of policy benefits in general aul believes that the proceeds and account value increases of a policy should be treated in a manner consistent with a fixedbenefit life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes thus the death benefit under the policy should be excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary under section a of the internal revenue code however if you elect a settlement option for a death benefit other than in a lump sum a portion of the payment made to you may be taxable depending on the circumstances the exchange of a policy a policy loan a partial surrender a surrender a change in ownership or an assignment of the policy may have federal income tax consequences in addition federal state and local transfer and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depends on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary the policy may also be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement therefore if you are contemplating the use of a policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on its tax consequences you should consult a qualified tax adviser regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement generally the owner will not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the account value including increments thereof until there is a distribution the tax consequences of distributions from and loans taken from or secured by a policy depend on whether the policy is classified as a modified endowment upon a complete surrender or lapse of a policy whether or not a modified endowment the excess of the amount received plus the amount any of outstanding loans and loan interests over the total investment in the policy will generally be treated as ordinary income subject to tax modified endowments section a establishes a class of life insurance policies designated as modified endowment contracts the rules relating to whether a policy will be treated as a modified endowment are extremely complex and cannot be adequately described in the limited confines of this summary in general a policy will be a modified endowment if the accumulated premiums paid at any time during the first seven policy years exceed the sum of the net level premiums which would have been paid on or before such time if the policy provided for paidup future benefits after the payment of seven level annual premiums a policy may also become a modified endowment after a material change the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment after a material change generally depends upon the relationship of the death benefit and account value at the time of such change and the additional premiums paid in the seven years following the material change pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd it is expected that most policies will be modified endowments due to the policys flexibility classification as a modified endowment will depend on the individual circumstances of each policy in view of the foregoing a current or prospective owner should consult with a tax adviser to determine whether a policy transaction will cause the policy to be treated as a modified endowment policies classified as modified endowments will be subject to the following first all distributions including distributions upon surrender and partial surrender from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the account value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy described below at such time second loans taken from or secured by such a policy are treated as distributions from the policy and taxed accordingly past due loan interest that is added to the loan amount will be treated as a loan third a  percent additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution from or loan taken from or secured by such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan is made on or after the owner attains age   is attributable to the owners becoming disabled or is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the owner and the owners beneficiary if a policy becomes a modified endowment after it is issued distributions made during the policy year in which it becomes a modified endowment distributions in any subsequent policy year and distributions within two years before the policy becomes a modified endowment will be subject to the tax treatment described above this means that a distribution from a policy that is not a modified endowment could later become taxable as a distribution from a modified endowment all modified endowments that are issued by aul or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year are treated as one modified endowment for purposes of determining the amount includable in an owners gross income under section e of the internal revenue code distributions from a policy that is not a modified endowment are generally treated as first recovering the investment in the policy described below and then only after the return of all such investment in the policy as distributing taxable income an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the owner in order for the policy to continue complying with the section  definitional limits such a cash distribution will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income to the extent of any gain in the policy under rules prescribed in section  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment are not treated as distributions instead such loans are treated as indebtedness of the owner finally neither distributions including distributions upon surrender nor loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment are subject to the  percent additional income tax policy loan interest generally consumer interest paid on any loan under a policy which is owned by an individual is not deductible for federal or state income tax purposes the deduction of other forms of interest paid on policy loans may also be subject to other restrictions under the internal revenue code a qualified tax adviser should be consulted before deducting any policy loan interest investment in the policy investment in the policy means i the aggregate amount of any premiums or other consideration paid for a policy minus ii the aggregate amount received under the policy which is excluded from gross income of the owner except that the amount of any loan from or secured by a policy that is a modified endowment to the extent such amount is excluded from gross income will be disregarded plus iii the amount of any loan from or secured by a policy that is a modified endowment to the extent that such amount is included in the gross income of the owner estate and generation skipping taxes when the insured dies the death benefits will generally be includable in the owners estate for purposes of federal estate tax if the insured owned the policy if the owner was not the insured the fair market value of the policy would be included in the owners estate upon the owners death nothing would be includable in the insureds estate if he or she neither retained incidents of ownership at death nor had given up ownership within three years before death federal estate tax is integrated with federal gift tax under a unified rate schedule an unlimited marital deduction may be available for federal estate and gift tax purposes the unlimited marital deduction permits the deferral of taxes until the death of the surviving spouse when the death benefits would be available to pay taxes due and other expenses incurred if the owner whether or not he or she is the insured transfers ownership of the policy to someone two or more generations younger the transfer may be subject to the generationskipping transfer tax with the taxable amount being the value of the policy the generationskipping transfer tax provisions generally apply to transfers which would be subject to the gift and estate tax rules because these rules are complex the owner should consult with a qualified tax adviser for specific information if ownership is passing to younger generations pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th life insurance purchased for use in split dollar arrangements on january   the irs released a technical advice memorandum

summary of the policy the investor should read the following summary of prospectus information and diagram of the policy in conjunction with the detailed information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus unless otherwise indicated the description of the policy in this prospectus assumes that the policy is in force that the last survivor rider is not in force and that there are no outstanding loans and loan interest the policy is similar in many ways to fixedbenefit life insurance as with fixedbenefit life insurance typically the owner of a policy pays premium payments for insurance coverage on the insured also like fixedbenefit life insurance the policy provides for accumulation of net premiums and a net cash value that is payable if the owner surrenders the policy during the insureds lifetime as with fixedbenefit life insurance the net cash value during the early policy years is likely to be lower than the premium payments paid however the policy differs from fixedbenefit life insurance in several important respects unlike fixedbenefit life insurance the death benefit may and the account value will increase or decrease to reflect the investment performance of the investment accounts to which account value is allocated also there is no guaranteed minimum net cash value nonetheless aul guarantees to keep the policy in force during the guarantee period shown on the policy data page of your policy if on each monthiversary the sum of the premiums paid to date less any partial surrenders loans and loan interest equals or exceeds the required premium for the guarantee period shown on the policy data page of your policy multiplied by the number of policy months since the policy date otherwise if the net cash value is insufficient to pay the monthly deduction the policy will lapse without value after a grace period see premium payments to prevent lapse if a policy lapses while loans are outstanding adverse tax consequences may result see tax considerations contract benefits cash benefits available under a contract include loans for up to  of the account value partial surrenders provided there is sufficient net cash value the ability to surrender the contract in full at any time for its net cash value less loan interest due on the next policy anniversary and any surrender charges death benefits include benefit payable to the beneficiary income tax free available as a lump sum or under a variety of settlement options either equal to the face amount or equal to the face amount plus account value flexibility to change the death benefit option and face amount contract risks aul intends for the policy to satisfy the definition of a life insurance policy under section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the internal revenue code under certain circumstances the internal revenue code will treat a policy as a modified endowment aul will monitor the policies and will attempt to notify you on a timely basis if your policy ceases to satisfy the federal tax definition of life insurance or becomes a modified endowment however we do not undertake to give you such notice or to take corrective action we reserve the right to refund any premiums that may cause the policy to become a modified endowment for further discussion of the tax status of a policy and the tax consequences of being treated as a life insurance contract or a modified endowment see tax considerations insufficient premium payments poor investment performance withdrawals and unpaid loans of loan interest may cause your policy to lapse endangering insurance coverage there is no guarantee that your policy will not lapse even if you pay your planned premium you should review your coverage with your registered representative on a regular basis withdrawal charges on full surrenders may inhibit your ability to access your cash value furthermore making a withdrawal or taking a loan may change your policys face amount andor death benefit reducing the death benefit proceeds payable to your beneficiary withdrawals and loans may make your policy more susceptible to lapse portfolio company risks each investment option invests in a corresponding mutual fund portfolio the value of each portfolio fluctuates with the value of the investments that it holds returns are not guaranteed you bear the investment risk of any investment option that you choose a comprehensive discussion of the risks of each mutual fund portfolio may be found in the mutual funds prospectus purpose of the policy aul designed the policy to provide longterm insurance benefits and it may also provide longterm accumulation of cash value you should evaluate the policy in conjunction with other insurance policies that you own as well as the need for insurance and the policys longterm potential for growth it may not be advantageous to replace existing insurance coverage with this policy right to examine policy and policy exchange for a limited time you have the right to cancel your policy and receive a refund see right to examine policy aul generally allocates net premiums to the fixed account and investment accounts on the later of the day the right to examine period expires or the date we receive the premium at our home office see premium allocations and crediting you may exchange the policy for a paidup whole life policy with a level

program the service portfolio optimization is an asset allocation service that we offer at no additional charge for use within this variable life policy asset allocation refers to the manner that investments are distributed among asset classes to help attain an investment goal for your policy portfolio optimization can help with decisions about how you should allocate your account value among available investment options the theory behind portfolio optimization is that diversification among asset classes can help reduce volatility over the long term as part of our portfolio optimization service we have developed several asset allocation models portfolio optimization models or models each based on different profiles of an investors willingness to accept investment risk if you decide to subscribe to the portfolio optimization service and select one of the portfolio optimization models your initial purchase payment in the case of a new application or account value as applicable will be allocated to the investment options according to the model you select subsequent purchase payments if allowed under your policy will also be allocated accordingly if you subscribe to portfolio optimization we will serve as your investment advisor for the service with all associated fiduciary responsibilities solely for purposes of development of the portfolio optimization models and periodic updates of the models on a periodic basis typically annually or when aul believes appropriate the portfolio optimization models are evaluated and the models are updated if you subscribe to portfolio optimization we will automatically reallocate your account value in accordance with the model you select as it is updated from time to time based on discretionary authority that you grant to us unless you instruct us otherwise for more information on our role as investment advisor for the portfolio optimization service please see our brochure from our form adv the sec investment adviser registration form which is included as an exhibit and delivered with this prospectus in developing and periodically updating the portfolio optimization models we currently rely on the recommendations of an independent thirdparty analytical firm we may change the firm that we use from time to time or to the extent permissible under applicable law use no independent firm at all the portfolio optimization models we offer five asset allocation models each comprised of a carefully selected combination of auloffered funds development of the portfolio optimization models is a twostep process first an optimization analysis is performed to determine the breakdown of asset classes optimization analysis requires forecasting returns standard deviations and correlation coefficients of asset classes over the desired investing horizon and an analysis using a stateofthe art program and a statistical analytical technique known as meanvariance optimization next after the asset class exposures are known a determination is made of how available investment options underlying portfolios can be used to implement the asset class level allocations the investment options are selected by evaluating the asset classes represented by the underlying portfolios and combining investment options to arrive at the desired asset class exposures the portfoliospecific analysis uses historical returnsbased style analysis and asset performance and regression and attribution analyses it may also include portfolio manager interviews based on this analysis investment options are selected in a way intended to optimize potential returns for each model given a particular level of risk tolerance this process could in some cases result in the inclusion of an investment option in a model based on its specific asset class exposure or other specific optimization factors even where another investment option may have better historical performance periodic updates of the portfolio optimization model and notices of updates each of the portfolio optimization models are evaluated periodically generally annually to assess whether the combination of investment options within each model should be changed to better seek to optimize the potential return for the level of risk tolerance intended for the model as a result of the periodic analysis each model may change and investment options may be added to a model including investment options not currently available or investment options may be deleted from a model when your portfolio optimization model is updated we will automatically reallocate your account value and subsequent premiums if applicable in accordance with any changes to the model you have selected this means the allocation of your account value and potentially the investment options in which you are invested will automatically change and your account value and subsequent premiums if applicable will be automatically reallocated among the investment options in your updated model we require that you grant us discretionary investment authority to periodically reallocate your account value and subsequent premiums if applicable in accordance with the updated version of the portfolio optimization model you have selected if you wish to participate in portfolio optimization when we update the portfolio optimizations models we will send you written notice of the updated models at least  days in advance of the date we intend the updated version of the model to be effective you should carefully review these notices if you wish to accept the changes in your selected model you will not need to take any action as your account value or subsequent premiums if applicable will be reallocated in accordance with the updated model automatically if you do not wish to accept the changes to your selected model you can change to a different model or withdraw from the portfolio optimization service some of the riders available under the contract require you to participate in a specific asset allocation service if you purchased any of these riders such riders will terminate if you withdraw from portfolio optimization or allocate any portion of your subsequent premiums or account value to an investment option that is not currently allowed with the rider as more fully described in each rider selecting a portfolio optimization model if you choose to subscribe to the portfolio optimization service you need to determine which portfolio optimization model is best for you aul will not make this decision you should consult with your registered representative on this decision your registered representative can help you determine which model is best suited to your financial needs investment time horizon and willingness to accept investment risk you should periodically review these factors with your registered representative to determine if you should change models to keep up with changes in your personal circumstances your registered  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd representative can assist you in completing the proper forms to subscribe to the portfolio optimization service or to change to a different model you may in consultation with your registered representative utilize analytical tools made available by aul including an investor profile questionnaire which asks questions intended to help you or your registered representative assess your financial needs investment time horizon and willingness to accept investment risk it is your decision in consultation with your registered representative to select a model or to change to a different model and aul bears no responsibility for this decision you may change to a different model at any time with a proper written request or by telephone or electronic instructions provided a valid telephoneelectronic authorization is on file with us quarterly reports if you select a portfolio optimization model you will be sent a quarterly report that provides information about the investment options within your selected model in addition to or as part of your usual quarterly statement risks although the models are designed to optimize returns given the various levels of risk there is no assurance that a model portfolio will not lose money or that investment results will not experience volatility investment performance of your account value could be better or worse by participating in a portfolio optimization model than if you had not participated a model may perform better or worse than any single investment option or asset class or other combinations of investment options or asset classes model performance is dependent upon the performance of the component investment options and their underlying portfolios the timing of your investment and the rebalancing may affect performance your account value will fluctuate and when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost a portfolio optimization model may not perform as intended although the models are intended to optimize returns given various levels of risk tolerance portfolio market and asset class performance may differ in the future from the historical performance and assumptions upon which the models are based which could cause the models to be ineffective or less effective in reducing volatility periodic updating of the portfolio optimization models can cause the underlying portfolios to incur transactional expenses to raise cash for money flowing out of the portfolios or to buy securities with money flowing into the portfolios these expenses can adversely affect performance of the pertinent portfolios and the models aul may be subject to competing interests that have the potential to influence its decision making with regard to portfolio optimization for example one portfolio may provide a higher fee to aul than another portfolio and provide aul with incentive to use the portfolio with the higher fee as part of a portfolio optimization model in addition aul may believe that certain portfolios may benefit from additional assets or could be harmed by redemptions as advisor to oneamerica funds inc we monitor performance of the portfolios and may from time to time recommend to the funds board of directors a change in portfolio management firm or strategy or the closure or merger of a portfolio all of which could impact a model all fund portfolios are analyzed by the independent third party analytical firm we do not dictate to the third party analytical firm the number of portfolios in a model the percent that any portfolio represents in a model or which portfolios may be selected other than to require exclusion of any portfolio that is expected to be liquidated merged into another portfolio or otherwise closed we believe our reliance on the recommendations of an independent thirdparty analytical firm to develop and update the models as described above reduces or eliminates the potential for us to be influenced by these competing interests but there can be no assurance of this aul is under no contractual obligation to continue this service and has the right to terminate or change the

models to reflect such changes your registered representative can assist you in completing the proper forms to enroll in portfolio optimization although the models are designed to optimize returns given the various levels of risk there is no assurance that a model portfolio will not lose money or that investment results will not experience some volatility historical market and asset class

obtained better returns in a single investment option or options representing a single asset class than in a model model portfolio performance is dependent upon the performance of the component

insurance charges specified in the policy will be insufficient to meet actual claims aul also assumes the mortality risk associated with guaranteeing the death benefit during the guarantee period the expense risk aul assumes is that expenses incurred in issuing and administering the policies and the separate account will exceed the amounts realized from the monthly administrative charges assessed

federal tax definition of a life insurance contract in accordance with the internal revenue code loan repayments unlike premium payments are not subject to premium expense charges when a loan repayment is made account value in the loan account in an amount equivalent to the repayment is transferred from the loan account to the investment accounts and the fixed account thus a loan repayment

have a permanent effect on the death benefit and policy values because the investment results of the investment accounts of the separate account and current interest rates credited on account value in the fixed account will apply only to the non loaned portion of the account value the longer the loan is outstanding the greater the effect is likely to be depending on the investment results of the investment accounts while the loan is outstanding the effect could be favorable or unfavorable policy loans may increase the potential for lapse if investment results of the investment accounts are less than anticipated also loans could particularly if not repaid make it more likely than otherwise for a policy to terminate see tax considerations for a discussion of the tax treatment of policy

frequency of payment acceptable to us specialized uses of the policy because the policy provides for an accumulation of cash value as well as a death benefit the policy can be used for various individual and business financial planning purposes purchasing the policy in part for such purposes entails certain risks for example if the investment performance of investment accounts to which variable account value is allocated is poorer than expected or if sufficient premiums are not paid the policy may lapse or may not accumulate sufficient variable account value to fund the purpose for which the policy was purchased partial surrenders and policy loans may significantly affect current and future account value net cash value or death benefit proceeds depending upon investment account investment performance and the amount of a policy loan the loan may cause a policy to lapse because the policy is designed to provide benefits on a longterm basis before purchasing a policy for a specialized purpose a purchaser should consider whether the longterm nature of the policy is consistent with the purpose for which it is being considered using a policy for a specialized purpose may have tax conse quences see tax considerations life insurance retirement plans any owners or applicants who wish to consider using the policy as a funding vehicle for nonqualified retirement purposes may obtain additional information from us an owner could pay premiums under a policy for a number of years and upon retirement could utilize a policys loan and partial withdrawal features to access account value as a source of retirement income for a period of time this use of a policy does not alter an owners rights or our obligations under a policy the policy would remain a life insurance contract that so long as it remains in force provides for a death benefit payable when the insured dies illustrations are available upon request that portray how the policy can be used as a funding vehicle for nonqualified retirement plans referred to herein as life insurance retirement plans for individuals illustrations provided upon request show the effect on account value cash value and the net death benefit of premiums paid under a policy and partial withdrawals and loans taken for retirement income or reflecting allocation of premiums to specified investment accounts this information will be portrayed at hypothetical rates of return that are requested charts and graphs presenting the results of the illustrations or a comparison of retirement strategies will also be furnished upon request any graphic presentations and retirement strategy charts must be accompanied by a corresponding illustration illustrations must always include or be accompanied by comparable information that is based on guaranteed cost of insurance rates and that presents a hypothetical gross rate of return of  retirement illustrations will not be furnished with a hypothetical gross rate of return in excess of  the hypothetical rates of return in illustrations are illustrative only and should not be interpreted as a representation of past or future investment results policy values and benefits shown in the illustrations would be different if the gross annual investment rates of return were different from the hypothetical rates portrayed if premiums were not paid when due and whether loan interest was paid when due withdrawals or loans may have an adverse effect on policy benefits risks of life insurance retirement plans using your policy as a funding vehicle for retirement income purposes presents several risks including the risk that if your policy is insufficiently funded in relation to the income stream expected from your policy your policy can lapse prematurely and result in significant income tax liability to you in the year in which the lapse occurs other risks associated with borrowing from your policy also apply loans will be automatically repaid from the death benefit at the death of the insured resulting in  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st the estimated payment to the beneficiary of the death benefit proceeds which will be less than the death benefit and may be less than the face amount upon surrender the loan will be automatically repaid resulting in the payment to you of the net cash value similarly upon lapse the loan will be automatically repaid and the policy will terminate without value the automatic repayment of the loan upon lapse or surrender will cause the recognition of taxable income to the extent that net cash value plus the amount of the repaid loan exceeds your basis in the policy thus under certain circumstances surrender or lapse of your policy could result in tax liability to you in addition to reinstate a lapsed policy you would be required to make certain payments thus you should be careful to design a life insurance retirement plan so that your policy will not lapse prematurely under various market scenarios as a result of withdrawals and loans taken from your policy to avoid lapse of your policy it is important to design a payment stream that does not leave your policy with insufficient net cash value determinations as to the amount to withdraw or borrow each year warrant careful consideration careful consideration should also be given to any assumptions respecting the hypothetical rate of return to the duration of withdrawals and loans and to the amount of account value that should remain in your policy upon its maturity poor investment performance can contribute to the risk that your policy may lapse in addition the cost of insurance generally increases with the age of the insured which can further erode existing net cash value and contribute to the risk of lapse further interest on a policy loan is due to us for any policy year on the policy anniversary if this interest is not paid when due it is added to the amount of the outstanding loans and loan interest and interest will begin accruing thereon from that date this can have a compounding effect and to the extent that the outstanding loan balance exceeds your basis in the policy the amounts attributable to interest due on the loans can add to your federal and possibly state income tax liability you should consult with your financial and tax advisors in designing a life insurance retirement plan that is suitable for your particular needs further you should continue to monitor the net cash value remaining in a policy to assure that the policy is sufficiently funded to continue to support the desired income stream and so that it will not lapse in this regard you should consult your periodic statements to determine the amount of the remaining net cash value illustrations showing the effect of charges under the policy upon existing account value or the effect of future withdrawals or loans upon the policys account value and death benefit are available from your representative consideration should be given periodically to whether the policy is sufficiently funded so that it will not lapse prematurely because of the potential risks associated with borrowing from a policy use of the policy in connection with a life insurance retirement plan may not be suitable for all owners these risks should be carefully considered before borrowing from the policy to provide an income stream other policy benefits and provisions limits on rights to contest the policy incontestability in the absence of fraud after the policy has been in force during the insureds

accelerated death benefit rider in order to receive benefits from this rider the policy and rider must be in force and an owner must submit proper notice of the claim to us at our home office proper notice means notice that is received at our home office in a form acceptable to us we may request additional medical information from the insureds physician andor may require an independent physical examination at our expense before approving the claim for payment of benefits we will not approve any benefits under the rider for a claim which is the result of intentionally selfinflicted injury or participation in a felony or if the benefits are payable under medicare or services are provided outside of the united states any additional exclusions may be noted in the adbr effect on existing policy the death benefit proceeds otherwise payable under a policy at the time of an insureds death will be reduced by the amount of the payments if the owner makes a request for a longterm care

deferred compensation plan tax considerations the following summary provides a general description of the federal income tax considerations associated with the policy and does not purport to be complete or to cover all situations this discussion is not intended as tax advice counsel or other competent tax advisors should be consulted for more complete information this discussion is based upon auls understanding of the present federal tax laws as they currently are interpreted by the internal revenue service the irs tax status of the policy in order to attain the tax benefits normally associated with life insurance the policy must be classified for federal income tax  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th purposes as a life insurance contract section  of the internal revenue code sets forth a definition of a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes the us treasury department the treasury is authorized to prescribe regulations implementing section  while proposed regulations and other interim guidance has been issued final regulations have not been adopted in short guidance as to how section  is to be applied is limited if a policy were determined not to be a life insurance contract for purposes of section  such policy would not provide the tax advantages normally provided by a life insurance contract with respect to a policy issued on a standard basis aul believes that such a policy should meet the section  definition of a life insurance contract with respect to a policy that is issued on a substandard basis ie a premium class with extra rating involving higher than standard mortality risk or one involving joint insureds there is less guidance in particular as to how the mortality and other expense requirements of section  are to be applied in determining whether such a policy meets the section  definition of a life insurance contract if the requirements of section  were deemed not to have been met the policy would not provide the tax benefits normally associated with life insurance and the tax status of all contracts invested in the investment account to which premiums were allocated under the nonqualifying contract might be affected if it is subsequently determined that a policy does not satisfy section  aul may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to attempt to cause such a policy to comply with section  for these reasons aul reserves the right to modify the policy as it deems necessary in its sole discretion to attempt to qualify it as a life insurance contract under section  section h of the internal revenue code requires that the investments of each of the investment accounts must be adequately diversified in accordance with treasury regulations in order for the policy to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the internal revenue code the investment accounts through the portfolios intend to comply with the diversification requirements prescribed in treas reg section  which affect how the portfolios assets are to be invested aul believes that the investment accounts will meet the diversification requirements and aul will monitor continued compliance with this requirement in certain circumstances owners of variable life insurance contracts may be considered the owners for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the investment accounts used to support their contracts in those circumstances income and gains from the investment account assets would be includible in the variable contract owners gross income the irs has stated in published rulings that a variable contract owner will be considered the owner of investment account assets if the contract owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets the treasury has also announced in connection with the issuance of regulations concerning diversification that those regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor ie the owner rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account this announcement also stated that guidance would be issued by way of regulations or rulings on the extent to which contract holders may direct their investments to particular investment accounts without being treated as owners of the underlying assets the ownership rights under the policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described by the irs in rulings in which it was determined that contract owners were not owners of investment account assets for example an owner has additional flexibility in allocating net premium payments and account value these differences could result in an owner being treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of the investment accounts in addition aul does not know what standards will be set forth if any in the regulations or rulings which the treasury has stated it expects to issue aul therefore reserves the right to modify the policy as necessary to attempt to prevent an owner from being considered the owner of a pro rata share of the assets of the investment accounts the following discussion assumes that the policy will qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes tax treatment of policy benefits in general aul believes that the proceeds and account value increases of a policy should be treated in a manner consistent with a fixedbenefit life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes thus the death benefit under the policy should be excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary under section a of the internal revenue code however if you elect a settlement option for a death benefit other than in a lump sum a portion of the payment made to you may be taxable depending on the circumstances the exchange of a policy a change in the policys death benefit option a policy loan a partial surrender a surrender a change in ownership or an assignment of the policy may have federal income tax consequences in addition federal state and local transfer and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depends on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary the policy may also be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement therefore if you are contemplating the use of a policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on its tax consequences you should consult a qualified tax advisor regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement generally the owner will not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the account value including increments thereof until there is a distribution the tax consequences of distributions from and loans taken from or secured by a policy depend on whether the policy is classified as a modified endowment upon a complete surrender or lapse of a policy whether or not a modified endowment the excess of the amount received plus the amount of any outstanding loans and loan interest over the  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th total investment in the policy will generally be treated as ordinary income subject to tax modified endowments section a establishes a class of life insurance policies designated as modified endowment contracts the rules relating to whether a policy will be treated as a modified endowment are extremely complex and cannot be adequately described in the limited confines of this summary in general a policy will be a modified endowment if the accumulated premiums paid at any time during the first seven policy years exceed the sum of the net level premiums which would have been paid on or before such time if the policy provided for paidup future benefits after the payment of seven level annual premiums a policy may also become a modified endowment after a material change the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment after a material change generally depends upon the relationship of the death benefit and account value at the time of such change and the additional premiums paid in the seven years following the material change due to the policys flexibility classification as a modified endowment will depend on the individual circumstances of each policy in view of the foregoing a current or prospective owner should consult with a tax adviser to determine whether a policy transaction will cause the policy to be treated as a modified endowment however at the time a premium is credited which in auls view would cause the policy to become a modified endowment aul will attempt to notify the owner that unless a refund of the excess premium with any appropriate interest is requested by the owner the policy will become a modified endowment however we do not undertake to provide such notice the owner will have  days after receiving such notification to request the refund policies classified as modified endowments will be subject to the following first all distributions including distributions upon surrender and partial surrender from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the account value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy described below at such time second loans taken from or secured by such a policy are treated as distributions from the policy and taxed accordingly past due loan interest that is added to the loan amount will be treated as a loan third a  percent additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution from or loan taken from or secured by such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan is made on or after the owner attains age   is attributable to the owners becoming disabled or is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the owner and the owners beneficiary if a policy becomes a modified endowment after it is issued distributions made during the policy year in which it becomes a modified endowment distributions in any subsequent policy year and distributions within two years before the policy becomes a modified endowment will be subject to the tax treatment described above this means that a distribution from a policy that is not a modified endowment could later become taxable as a distribution from a modified endowment all modified endowments that are issued by aul or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year are treated as one modified endowment for purposes of determining the amount includible in an owners gross income under section e of the internal revenue code distributions from a policy that is not a modified endowment are generally treated as first recovering the investment in the policy described below and then only after the return of all such investment in the policy as distributing taxable income an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the owner in order for the policy to continue complying with the section  definitional limits such a cash distribution will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income to the extent of any gain in the policy under rules prescribed in section  loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment are not treated as distributions instead such loans are treated as advances of the death benefit to the owner finally neither distributions including distributions upon surrender nor loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment are subject to the  percent additional income tax policy loan interest generally consumer interest paid on any loan under a policy which is owned by an individual is not deductible for federal or state income tax purposes the deduction of other forms of interest paid on policy loans may also be subject to other restrictions under the internal revenue code a qualified tax adviser should be consulted before deducting any policy loan interest investment in the policy investment in the policy means  the aggregate amount of any premiums or other consideration paid for a policy minus  the aggregate amount received under the policy which is excluded from gross income of the owner except that the amount of any loan from or secured by a policy that is a modified endowment to the extent such amount is excluded from gross income will be disregarded plus  the amount of any loan from or secured by a policy that is a modified endowment to the extent that such amount is included in the gross income of the owner tax treatment of longterm care accelerated death benefit rider it is intended that the longterm care accelerated death benefit rider benefits provided by this policy qualify as taxfree benefits under section bb andor section g of the internal revenue code benefit amounts from this policy plus any per diem longterm care insurance benefits will be includible in income if they exceed the limits set in section bd charges for this rider may be treated as a taxable distribution from the policy and might also be subject to the  penalty tax if the policy is a modified endowment contract as discussed previously the longterm care accelerated death benefit rider may be issued in certain states as a non qualified rider ie it would not constitute qualified longterm care insurance under section bb of the code tax treatment of nonqualified benefits is uncertain at this time  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th the tax comments in this section reflect our understanding of the current federal tax laws as they relate to the longterm care accelerated death benefit rider since these laws are subject to interpretation and change we recommend you seek individual advice from your tax advisor estate and generation skipping taxes when the insured dies the death benefits will generally be includible in the owners estate for purposes of federal estate tax if the insured owned the policy if the owner was not the insured the fair market value of the policy would be included in the owners estate upon the owners death nothing would be includible in the insureds estate if he or she neither retained incidents of ownership at death nor had given up ownership within three years before death federal estate tax is integrated with federal gift tax under a unified rate schedule an unlimited marital deduction may be available for federal estate and gift tax purposes the unlimited marital deduction permits the deferral of taxes until the death of the surviving spouse if the owner whether or not he or she is the insured transfers ownership of the policy to someone two or more generations younger the transfer may be subject to the generationskipping transfer tax with the taxable amount being the value of the policy the generationskipping transfer tax provisions generally apply to transfers which would be subject to the gift and estate tax rules because these rules are complex the owner should consult with a qualified tax advisor for specific information if ownership is passing to younger generations life insurance purchased for use in split dollar arrangements final regulations on splitdollar life insurance arrangements were issued by the treasury department effective september   modifying irs notice  rev rul  irb  nonqualified deferred compensation on october   irc section a was enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of  contributions into nonqualified deferred compensations plans after december

section b of the code payments made by certain employers ie taxexempt organizations meeting the requirements of section c of the code or public educational institutions to purchase policies for their

purchase payments are a result of voluntary salary reduction amounts or employer contributions salary reduction payments however are subject to fica social security taxes taxation of distributions distributions from a section b policy are taxed as ordinary income to the recipient taxable distributions received before the employee attains age   generally are subject to  penalty tax in addition to regular income tax certain distributions are excepted from this penalty tax including distributions following the employees death disability separation from service after age  separation from service at any age if the distribution is in the form of an annuity for the life or life expectancy of the employee or the employee and beneficiary and distributions not in excess of deductible medical expenses in addition no distributions of voluntary salary reduction amounts made for years after december   plus earnings thereon and earnings on policy values as of december   will be permitted prior to one of the following events attainment of age   by the employee or the employees separation from service death disability or hardship hardship distributions will be limited to the lesser of the amount of the hardship or the amount of salary reduction contributions exclusive of earnings thereon required distributions at the time of retirement the policy must be  transferred to a nonlife insurance b contract which complies with the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and will continue in force subject to the payment of any required premium and the provisions of the b policy endorsement will no longer apply to the policy or  surrendered or  distributed nonindividual ownership of contracts if the owner of a policy is an entity rather than an individual the tax treatment may differ from that described above accordingly prospective owners that are entities should consult a qualified tax advisor possible charge for auls taxes at the present time aul makes

annuity and variable life insurance policies we do not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the funds selling shares as an investment medium for products other than the policies

insurance policies and variable annuity contracts issued by other companies whose values are allocated to one or more other separate accounts investing in any one of the funds shares of some of the funds may also be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans qualifying under section  of the internal revenue code as a result there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of owners or owners of other contracts including contracts issued by other companies and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans in the event of a material
