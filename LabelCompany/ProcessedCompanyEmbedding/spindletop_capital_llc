thrive customers investors employees partners communities and society these rare authentic firms of endearment act in powerfully positive ways that stakeholders recognize value admire and even love they make the world better by the way they do businessand the world responds” from 998 sisodia and his colleagues found that firms driven by purpose and passion outperformed the sp  by 4x up 68 in  years conscious capitalism recognizes that all stakeholders are interconnected management shareholders investors customers vendors and communities the four basic tenants of a conscious business as defined by whole foods cofounder john mackey and raj sisodia in their book conscious capitalism are “purpose stakeholder orientation conscious leadership and conscious culture” businesses that inspire higher purpose benefit all stakeholders including their employees vendors customers community investors stakeholder orientation run by leaders focused on alignment of interests that create a culture
