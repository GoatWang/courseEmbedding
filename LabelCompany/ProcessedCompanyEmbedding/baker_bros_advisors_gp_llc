premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search heres why the baker bros are gobbling up this emerging cancer company the renowned healthcare investing firm has slowly amassed a huge position in seattle genetics should investors consider riding on their coattails george budwell tmfgbudwell sep   at am the  billion healthcare specialist investing firm comanaged by felix and julian baker known as the baker bros advisors is regarded as one of the best when it comes to picking stocks in this volatile sector  and for good reason the baker bros for instance have had the rare insight to gobble up shares in former smallcap companies like acadia pharmaceuticals bluebird bio and synageva biopharma corp before they ripped higher so when this fund starts to accumulate shares in a company investors may want to take heed  on that note the baker bros have slowly been building a massive position in the antibody drug conjugate or adc specialist seattle genetics nasdaqsgen for a few years now even adding almost  million more shares to their holdings in the second quarter of  according to the quarterly fs filed with the sec in total the firms holdings in the drugmaker are valued at around  billion making it the largest stakeholder in the company  given their significant financial interest in seattle genetics and the fact that felix baker sits on its board of directors  i think its worth the effort to consider if investors should add this stock to their portfolios so lets take a look at what seattle genetics has to offer investors as a midcap biotech stock  seattle genetics is specializing in an emerging field of novel cancer treatmentsbefore immunotherapies stole the headlines and perhaps the show as well adcs were believed to be one of the most promising new classes of cancer treatments coming online after several cases of offsite toxicity cropped up in clinical studies for some experimental adcs though the investing community seemingly forgot about them overnight but the pharma industry has not forgotten not by a long shot by contrast several pharma companies have been working vigorously on improving the technology to make it both safer and more effective across a wide variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies   this work has so far spawned several regulatory approvals for seattle genetics adcetris for various forms of blood cancer and roches kadcyla for herpositive metastatic breast cancer  source seattle genetics commercially speaking these two drugs have also been fairly successful as novel oncology treatments adcetris secondquarter sales for example grew to  million compared to approximately  million for the same period a year ago and not to be outdone kadcyla posted a monstrous  sales growth rate in the first half of  relative to the same period a year ago perhaps the key takeaway from these figures is that the medical community appears to be deeply interested in employing adcs in the fight against cancer  is seattle genetics a buyan easy criticism to lob at seattle genetics is that its a smaller biopharma trying to compete against the big boys like pfizer and roche among others but a deeper look at the company shows that it is a central player in the adc field with major licensing agreements with abbvie glaxosmithkline pfizer roche and many others already in play in short big pharma and biotech appear to be rather optimistic about seattle genetics drug development platform moving forward  so what investors need to understand is that adcs are probably not going to be displaced by the suite of checkpoint inhibitors grabbing the headlines right now evinced in part by big pharmas major investment in this technology and the real focus is to refine the adc platform as a whole turning to the question of whether seattle genetics stock is a buy or not i think the answer is a yes from a fundamental perspective the drugmaker may not look like a compelling value buy  largely because of its huge and growing clinical program that is keeping the companys ledger in the red but its massive core clinical program that sports  clinical candidates being assessed across a whopping  indications has the potential to generate multiple products with each one capable of raking in hundreds of millions in annual revenue and then theres seattle genetics wide diversity of research collaborations that also could lead to a substantial upswing in royalty payments all told seattle genetics wide diversity of clinical activities gives it several shots on goal in terms of turning the company into a profitable operation which is probably one of the main reasons why the baker bros are so keen on this midcap biotech stock    george budwell owns shares of abbvie the motley fool recommends bluebird
