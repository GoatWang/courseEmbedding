giants columbiana foods inc columbiana is holding tight to independent family ownership the ohiobased grocer is a franchisee of giant eagle supermarkets which also happens to be an ohio native “we have a strong relationship with giant eagle” shares ron graff jr vice president of store operations for columbiana “there are  giant eagle stores throughout ohio west virginia pennsylvania and maryland and only about  of them are independently owned and operated columbiana owns three giant eagle stores one in youngstown and two in east liverpool ohio” a dream and the drive to do it the company now owns over  square feet of retail grocery space however since its inception in 78 columbiana has remained committed to partnerships family ownership the simple ideal of highquality fresh food and service cleanliness and community outreach the history of columbiana is a simple but inspiring story of two men with similar dreams who met in the right place at the right time ron graff sr an air force veteran who returned from duty joined his father as an employee at the local ap store first bagging groceries ron sr quickly rose through the ranks to store manager divisional buyer and merchandising sales manager for the company  in 7 looking to grow beyond a single store ron sr joined sm flickinger a grocery wholesale company where he met joe mcandrew joe who dreamed of being a worldclass butcher also had aspirations bigger than his position as meat manger he too joined sm flickinger with a shared vision the pair bought a former super duper in columbiana ohio in 78 with nothing but dreams and a  mortgage the risk was well worth it ron sr and joe decided to stick to a downhome familyfeel a deliberate turn from the cold cutthroat corporate operations of their past the duo vowed to treat employees with respect and offer room for growth in 8 the partners bought a store in east liverpool ohio at twice the size of the first store in columbiana  it wasn’t until 8 that columbiana formed its long standing relationship with giant eagle “my father and joe bought a squarefoot store in calcutta ohio and that commenced our relationship with giant eagle” recalls ron jr “we’ve undergone major remodels and it now covers  square feet” a family affair as ron sr and joe wanted it to be columbiana has remained in the hands of following generations for decades “i run columbiana with my brother bob graff our president and chief operating officer” shares ron jr “our sister cheryl shartel is also involved and our sisterinlaw controls human resources along with my wife perishable director our children and this company’s fourth generation are also getting ready to take on a significant role in the business” columbiana built its first groundup store in  a giant eagle in the center of the churchill commons shopping center on belmont avenue belmont avenue is now the company’s notsocorporate headquarters with  square feet of retail space offering an extensive variety of fresh produce meats and groceries along with specialty gourmet foods banking and even a dry cleaning dropoff center “when people come into our store they know they’re getting low prices that are always low there’s no oneday sale or gimmicks” explains ron sr “our prices on seasonal items stay low for months and we also offer a shopper’s advantage card that helps customers who regularly shop here save” in a market where foreign companies are coming in and setting up giant retail outlets ron jr says it is columbiana’s relationship with giant eagle that has kept the company going strong for so many years “giant eagle is pennsylvaniabased privately held and americanowned you really can’t beat that” he assures “we wouldn’t be with any other wholesaler they’re always on the cuttingedge of technology and marketing” ron jr adds that columbiana’s community involvement has also helped the company’s good standing over the years “giving back to the community is our no  mission statement” he says “we work with organizations such as h the united way rotary local food banks and schools” with a still slow economic outlook in ohio and government regulations that are less than small business friendly ron jr says his main concern is remaining a strong employer for his employees and their families “we’ve been doing this for four generations there’s a lot of people who rely on this company” he assures over the years the faces behind the counter at columbiana foods inc have changed however the dedication to highquality fresh food honest service and prices cleanliness and the
