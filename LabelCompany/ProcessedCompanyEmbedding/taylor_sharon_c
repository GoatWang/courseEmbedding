taylor march     share on facebook tweet on twitter sharon c taylorsenior vice president human resourcesprudential financialnewark nj   when it comes to examples of hard work strong ethics and sacrifice sharon taylor didn’t have to look farther than her own parents her father worked up to three jobs at the same time to support their family and her mother sacrificed her own professional dreams on the family’s behalf “both of my parents acknowledged that life is not fair they explained that you have to learn from your mistakes never give up and not to wallow in selfpity and bitterness” says taylor   taylor’s resilience was tested early on when she encountered a tough college professor who almost caused her to change her major but she used her parents’ example and teachings to move past this obstacle she maintains that the experience made her a better person because she learned from the professor’s toughness the value of candid feedback and of setting high standards for oneself she ultimately graduated with honors from temple university with a bachelor’s degree in spanish linguistics and translation   taylor has enjoyed a successful career at prudential financial for more than years that career began with an internship that led to opportunities for significant roles including her current position as senior vice president for human resources she now has accountability to the firm’s chairman and ceo and board of directors for global hr policies strategies systems programs and infrastructure that support the company’s domestic and international businesses   an avid proponent of education taylor is actively involved with the elmwood united presbyterian church eupc scholarship committee which provides scholarships to innercity youth pursing undergraduate graduate and professional degrees she herself was one of the committee’s first scholarship recipients “their prayers support and monetary generosity inspired me to finish my education” she says “i never forgot their acts of kindness and to this day i am inspired to help do the same for others” related articlesmore from author  natasha l wilson  machelle d williams  charlene a
