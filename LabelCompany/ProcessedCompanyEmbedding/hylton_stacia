has nominated stacia hylton who has strong ties to the private prison industry to oversee the us marshals which is responsible for awarding contracts to build federal prisons and house people incarcerated in them sen patrick leahy has scheduled a hearing on her confirmation for the senate judiciary committee on november th if her nomination is approved it would be a major blow to criminal justice reform while us federal detention trustee hylton awarded several multimillion dollar contracts to the geo group the countrys second largest private jailer she also awarded corrections corporation of america cca the largest us private prison company an  million contract for a  bed prison in nevada when she retired as trustee earlier this year the president of cca attended her retirement party immediately after retiring hylton began earning sixfigures consulting for geo and now she wants back in the administration where she will be in a position to award her friends in the private prison industry with more fat contracts for building more beds that would allow our incarceration rate to grow even more  please tell the administration to withdraw the nomination of a prison profiteer and instead nominate a person who is committed to reducing this countrys incarceration rate and reigning in those who profit from it and tell senator leahy and his committee to demand a new

rate of incarceration and the revolving door of government workers become highly paid industry lobbyists i am asking you to oppose stacia hyltons name as nominee for us marshallthis year after awarding private prison companies millions of dollars as a top doj employee ms hylton made more than  as a consultant for the private prison industry  which stands to gain the most by increasing the number of people imprisoned in our country we need someone in this important position who is committed to reducing the number of people behind bars in federal prisons and someone committed to shrinking the influence of private prison companies president obama when you ran for office you vowed to close the revolving door please demonstrate this commitment to both good government and criminal justice reform by withdrawing ms hyltons name and appointing a real advocate for changing the course and moving our country away from being the worlds biggest jailer and senator leahy and
