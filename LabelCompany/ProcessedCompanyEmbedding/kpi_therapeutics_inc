the kv channel from the same family of compounds as shk which kpi therapeutics is developing as a topical cream for atopic dermatitis psoriasis and other dermatological complications associated with inflammatory diseases kpi targets the kv channel on effector memory t cells which are the subset of t cells that are found at the sites of inflammation in a variety of different autoimmune diseases like atopic dermatitis these t cells are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease blocking the kv channel inhibits the effector functions of these effector memory t cells and helps ameliorate disease we have shown through immunohistochemistry analysis that the infiltrating t cells in atopic dermatitis express high levels of the kv channel and are thus a good target for kpi treatment kpi is

development status we have shown that topical administration of kpi works in a number of in vivo efficacy models kpi has demonstrated dosedependent activity in an atopic dermatitis model where the drug was able to reduce inflammation t cell infiltration and markers of inflammation when applied topically based upon nonclinical models we anticipate kpi will be well tolerated drug formulation optimization and skin penetration assessments are ongoing to further develop kpi for dermatologic applications topical administration has been shown to work in various in vivo models reducing inflammation along with associated biomarkers the shk family is well tolerated as shown in our toxicology studies kpi is undergoing formulation optimization related fact sheets autoimmune platform
