she joined acorda’s inhouse legal team in  shortly before the release of zanaflex capsules its first marketed product which reduces muscle spasticity in patients with ms spinal cord injuries and brain trauma she helped the company build its marketing and distribution infrastructure “almost overnight” she says which is no small feat considering all the regulations put on marketing pharmaceuticals

spearheaded a redesign of operations that better allowed for collaboration within the company—and now she has her sites set abroad participating in strategic planning for acorda to expand

one of her greatest career achievements since it helps people with multiple sclerosis improve their ability to walk “we should all feel proud of that” she says wasman also takes pride in mentoring the approximately  people who report to her many of whom are also women “it’s great for them to see that a woman can in fact get to the executive team” she says she notes that women comprise  percent of acorda’s fulltime employees for no reason other than the company “genuinely values diversity”  looking beyond her company wasman contributes to the area’s biotech boom by serving on the board of new york bio formerly nyba “new york as a state has everything to be a major biotech hub and we haven’t quite gotten there yet” she says “we have some of the best university and research institutions in
