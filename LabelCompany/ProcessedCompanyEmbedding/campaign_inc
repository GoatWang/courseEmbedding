week what will tesla announce daniel sparks tmfdanielsparks oct   at pm elon musk at a tesla event image source tesla motors electriccar maker tesla motors nasdaqtsla plans to host a product unveiling on oct  ceo elon musk announced on twitter over the weekend exactly what the new product will be is unknown but previous comments from management offer some suggestions heres what there is to know ahead of teslas event on monday what it wont be tesla product unveiling on the th unexpected by most musk tweeted on sunday the cryptic language was enough to prompt speculation while simultaneously leaving investors pretty much clueless thanks a lot elon fortunately musk did rule out one announcement when he tweeted that the event would be followed by teslasolarcity on the th this statement referenced a previous tweet in september noting the company was aiming to reveal its new solar roof with an integrated secondgeneration energy storage product and a tesla charger on oct  its not clear whether this oct  product announcement is contingent on the closing of its acquisition attempt of solar panel company solarcity  a deal tesla hopes to close in the fourth quarter of  but it looks like tesla is continuing to plan on the event even as the two companies remain separate so teslas oct  announcement likely wont be related to energy storage or solarcitys upcoming solarroof product what it might be besides teslas promised nextgeneration energy storage products there are two pending events management has previously said it would hold in the near future a part  demonstration of its model  and a more advanced version of autopilot could the unveiling have to do with either of these upcoming announcements just before tesla first unveiled its model  design on march  musk said the event was just part  of the model  unveil part  which takes things to another level will be close to production model  prototype image source tesla motors since model  deliveries arent expected to begin until late  a part  model  unveiling next week is unlikely a more likely announcement for october is a nextgeneration autopilot system when musk was asked at recodes code conference  about whether model  would have autonomous driving capabilities the ceo said tesla would host an event later in  to talk more about that heres an excerpt from musks conversation with recodes walt mossberg and kara swisher mossberg the model  will have autonomous for  musk i have a  im going to do another tesla event maybe by the end of the year to talk more about that mossberg well so you can start here musk it will be real big news if i start here mossberg we dont mind that musk let me just say that were going to do the obvious thing mossberg and swisher ok musk its really obvious currently teslas autopilot system puts all the responsibility on the driver serving as a driverassist technology autopilot automatically steers brakes and changes lanes on the highway but it requires that drivers remain alert keeping their hands on the wheel and ready to take control if the autopilot fails to drive correctly a more advanced autopilot system might bring tesla vehicles closer to full autonomy as musk as warned repeatedly though regulation will likely lag advancements toward autonomy so its unlikely even a more advanced system would readily relieve drivers of their driving responsibilities of course tesla could very well announce something totally different from these two products musk has hinted at while next weeks announcement in and of itself could be enough to impact an investing thesis in the stock investors should file this as a big unknown until its clear exactly what tesla is unveiling daniel sparks owns shares of tesla motors the motley fool owns shares of and recommends tesla motors

product into a consumer success by drew gannon drewgannon  comments the oona smartphone stand credit when tv commercials for the snuggie launched in october of  they were difficult to take seriously for anyone with an extra sweatshirt in their closet a lounging womans debate between keeping her arms warm and completing simple tasks like answering the phone or knitting was hardly inspiration to directorder a  sleeved blanket and by the time the ad showed an entire snuggieclad family cheering at a sporting event some viewers were too busy laughing to pick up the phone   but when four million snuggies were sold in four months the snuggies creator allstar products had the last laugh within months of its introduction the snuggie transformed from a virtually unknown product into a pop culture phenomenon appearing on the today show referenced on hit tv comedy  rock and featured in the tabloids hundreds of facebook groups and youtube parodies spread awareness and boosted sales once we got people talking it turned into a great product says scott boilen allstar products ceo it was almost like why wouldnt a blanket have sleeves today more than  million snuggies have been sold making the brand an exemplar for oneofakind products seeking mass consumer acceptance with tens of thousands of inventions conceived each year turning an innovative new product into a consumer staple isnt easy it requires creativity ingenuity and persistence to break into a market and convince consumers they need something that never existed before follow the example of the snuggie and other successful products to make your own invention into a sensation  how to market a new product design a campaign with builtin motivation yes the creators of snuggie were in on the joke allstar products intentionally gave its product a quirky name and an overthetop commercial to promote fun and fashion but the snuggie still upheld allstars core purpose problem solving were a problemsolution company says boilen we show a problem to a consumer and give them an excellent way to solve it at a good price in order to make a new product something consumers cant live without it needs to serve a purpose in your customers life defining that purpose depends on your individual products functionality allstars problemsolution method takes daily activities and enhances them with a new idea the direct marketing consumer product company used a similar solutionbased method when promoting topsy turvy a device that allows tomatoes to grow upside down to provide freshgrown produce without the traditional hassles of a full garden that was more about functionality than fun boilen says it was a different message that took a little longer for people to get out there but it was also a big hit for vapur a twoyearold company that designs foldable reusable water bottles defining a purpose was twofold both solving a problem and embracing changing consumer desires we knew there was a lot of need for a green water bottle because the green movement was taking off the economy was tanking and people were looking for away to get off bottled water says cofounder jason carignan the problem with traditional bottles was that they were as bulky empty as they were full a few rare products are able to leave their purpose undefined using their customers imaginations to fill in the blanks the oona a versatile smartphone holder recently funded through kickstarter defines itself as whatever you need it to be we wanted to create a stand that could do as many things in the physical world as your phone can do in the virtual world says cofounder sam gordon dig deeper how to define your target market how to market a new product focus on the descriptors in your marketing   once you have a product and youve figured out precisely the role it would play in a consumers life its time to share that with the public in order to inspire potential customers to think outside the box the oona created a video showing their smartphone stand serving as many purposes in as many places as possible in under three minutes the creators use of multimedia set them apart from other kickstarter projects helping them shatter their  goal with  in funding from  backers—a top record for the crowdfunding site finding the perfect words to describe an innovative product through video or more traditional forms of branding can be time consuming make sure to allocate enough time before a product launch to allow for a thorough thought process remembering that you have to build consumer understanding from nothing we were in development for six to nine months going through rounds and rounds of naming says carignan on vapurs branding process  do we call it a flexible bottle a water skin a pouch eventually vapur named itself the antibottle accepting that its consumers would feel more comfortable with a conventional descriptor still carignan says the anti prefix sets vapur apart from its competitors you put all the rigid bottles in one corner and us in the other he says were the other better option sometimes regardless of how much thought you put into your original ideas branding becomes an evolution over time since it was first released in  the roomba the now iconic robotic vacuum has undergone multiple branding changes its parent company irobot never intended to call the roomba a robot when we tested the roomba with customers and asked if it was a robot they said no says colin angle irobots chairman and ceo a robot is a humanoid like commander data on star trek so we called it an automated vacuum however as review after review described the roomba as a robot public perception began to change so irobot changed its branding as well we went from auto vac to robotic vacuum to robo vac to a vacuuming robot says angle now if you wonder if roomba is a robot of course its a robot  dig deeper new rules of branding your business online how to market a new product prove that it works the press not only served the roomba in transforming its branding but also helped irobot overcome general skepticism about their products effectiveness and thats been one of the products major barriers to purchase from day one to today according to angle the press has become the roombas best and most effective ally for whatever reason the press has always been interested in robots and like our consumers all of them were incredibly skeptical when we gave them one says angle and then it worked you take these skeptics give them something that turns them from skeptic to supporter and they often become rabid supporters vapur also relied on sampling to bloggers and social media reviews in order to build a more genuine overview of the product that was really critical because once opinionated people started using the product and promoting it people saw the benefits in a way we were not able to share objectively says carignan once youve got your message defined youve got to get it out working with the media did exactly that for the oona a week after its launch on kickstarter several publications began reviewing the stand including the fast company design blog on may  —the day fast companys review came out—the oona saw more than  in pledges starting a massive upward trajectory for the product that was the tipping point says gordon from then on more and more blogs picked up the story and we saw hundreds if not thousands of tweets and facebook likes about the oona marketing through social media is an increasingly effective way not only to gain popularity but also to help your new product prove itself to consumers directly when the roombas potential clients raised concerns about their pets safety irobot relied on viral youtube videos made by roomba owners of cats dogs and even turtles riding on the vacuum people made them and people loved them says angle so we went with it dig deeper how to use samples to promote your product how to market a new product personalize it   since introducing its three original colors in  the snuggie has relied on its consumers—including its  facebook fans—to create the next generation of snuggies theyre giving longevity to our brand says boilen with any product make sure youre connecting with your customer make sure youre communicating with them and make sure youre partnering with them to build your brand for the future since day one the roomba has put customer service before all else in the roombas first years even angle took his turn manning the customer support line where he learned just how much his product meant to his customers i was on the phone with a lady with a broken roomba so i told her to send it back to the store for a replacement he recalls there was a pause on the line and she said ‘no im not giving your rosie that was when i knew we had something special according to angle over eight percent of people name their roomba making it more a part of the family even in its nascent stage the oona also learned to personalize gordon a public relations agent by day spends his nights responding to between  and   emails tweets comments and posts the oona generates daily through social media i would do it all night if i needed to says gordon we are so passionate about our product so we love to see the positive feedback and suggestions from people who a month ago didnt know we existed we havent been around for long but we will be dig deeper how to deliver great customer service published on jun   find jobs at activecampaign inc  hired job directory information tech active campaign inc growth

is doing something right besides making products people worship once you’ve got the goods here’s how to take a page from its marketing playbook by catherine kaputa minute readwhether it’s launching its latest iphone or ipad apple sure knows how to create buzz with consumers and the media recent maps debacle aside while other companies fight for attention apple seems to effortlessly dominate the media–not to mention the hearts and minds of customers–with its new product launches recently apple sold  million iphone ’s on day one and then a couple of days later the stock hit the stratospheric price of  a share so you could say they’re doing something rightadvertisementin researching hundreds of successful entrepreneurial companies for my new book i was struck by strategies and tactics used by apple to create media and consumer buzz that were not commonly employed by other brandsif you want to build buzz like apple does–and maybe someday get your stock to their level–take note of these five marketing tactics they cultivate an air of secrecy and intrigue to fuel speculation and buzz many companies go to great lengths to preserve confidentiality during the product development phase but apple is a master of the teaser marketing campaign dragging on the suspense for as long as possible for weeks if not months before the release of every iphone the media conversation builds to deafening levels apple stokes the buzz by providing virtually no information for example apple announced a press conference for september   but didn’t say what the press announcement was about in essence apple created a cliffhanger as the media and bloggers speculated”what could it be–the new iphone  or something else all the bottomup speculation in the media and blogosphere generated phenomenal consumer interest–for free only after weeks of free buzz did apple launch a paid media campaign to keep the momentum goingthe takeawaystart building relationships with the media and bloggers–the influencers who cover your industry nurture and expand them over time remember the internet is word of mouth on steroids marketers have always known that the best way to promote your product is to get others to do it for you nothing is more valuable than getting thirdparty experts to tout your brand take another page from apple’s marketing book and launch a teaser campaign a series of short cryptic announcements that lead up to a larger fullblown marketing campaign and watch the interest and momentum buildthey create the illusion of scarcity to increase demandluxury goods marketers have long realized that scarcity real or perceived makes a product more desirable and in demand scarcity not only increases the value of a product it propels the procrastinators and all us who want to be part of the trendy crowd to step up and buy that’s why it is a favored tactic of designer handbag manufacturers and other luxury goods apple has found its own ways to hype the sense of faux scarcity it did not have enough phones available when it went on sale just one hour after the iphone  went on sale for preorders on september   the apple website reported that heavy demand had necessitated delayed delivery adding to the illusion of scarcity was the fact that you could only preorder the phone and lines were long the tactic worked not only did the iphone  set a record for firstday sales even two weeks after the iphone went on sale it was on a back order of three to four weeks prolonging the difficulty and desirability of owning oneadvertisementthe takeawayconsider intentionally restricting production of a product to create scarcity and fuel demand for your product other tactics you can explore are making the offer only available for a limited time or until a certain number have been sold or you can report on your website or customer sales calls that only a small number of certain items are left in stock–but only if that’s really the casethey focus on a “friendly” customer experienceapple products have always been designed to be different delightful and friendly i say “friendly” because the core driver of every apple product is the removal of complexity in favor of ease of use with innovative features like touchscreen “gestures” for zooming and scrolling or siri your personal assistant its history of innovative “friendly” gadgets creates anticipation about what they will do next to advance the consumer experience the new iphone  ads capture its new friendly features in one phrase “inch retina display ultrafast wireless ios  in a thinner lighter design”the takeawaythink outsidein as smart branders do begin with your customer first outside then figure out how your can improve your product or service to meet that customer need inside ask yourself “what would make your product easier to use for customers” and “how can you make the customer experience special and different–at every touch point” think of the customer experience holistically don’t stop with the product design but look at the way it’s sold and displayed in the store or on your website as well as the customer service experience with your call center make sure that the customer benefits your product offers are crisp and clear in all your marketing–like the iphone tagline abovethey wow customers through design and packagingnot only does apple have a history of product innovations they package their products brilliantly steve jobs famously looked outside the tech world for design and packaging inspiration at japanese packaging design italian car finishes and the like he was one of the first technology leaders to realize that beautiful design can be an important product differentiator apple’s brand architecture is monolithic every touch point conveys a modern minimalistic brand image from the product design itself to its packaging to the apple store where you can buy it go into an apple store and you’ll find the same design aesthetic and brand personality as you’ll find in the gadget in your hand many customers are so wowed by apple’s beautiful”open me first” packaging that they don’t throw it away which is called “unboxing”advertisementthe takeawaymake sure every touch point where customers come into contact with your company and its products conveys your company’s brand personality with a unified visual identity a distinct look and feel that sets you apart from others find a visual hook a visual something a design a color a logo or a shape that your brand can own in the minds of customers aim to have a visual identity that is instantly recognizable like apple’sthey create a passionate brand community of fans who identity with apple’s brand valueswhile other tech manufacturers see their products as utilitarian geeky and inexpensive apple is the opposite cool friendly and upmarket apple has created a brand culture that has attracted a passionate brand community of followers who identify with the brand’s innovativeness simplicity and coolness they are fans who lock into the entire family of apple products and must have the latest gadget right when it comes out even if it means waiting in line for hours it’s quite a phenomenon to beholdthe takeawaywrite down your brand values that define your brand culture remember apple’s “think different” ad campaign that defined apple’s brand values and brand culture here were the opening lines “here’s to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in square holes…” once you have defined what your brand stands for then zero in on the types of consumers who share those values and create digital communities through social media blogs or inperson meetups so that it’s easy for your brand’s fans to connect to your company and each otherif you want to get your products noticed maybe it’s time for you to start breaking the rules as apple doesadvertisementcatherine kaputa is a brand consultant and author of breakthrough

guerrero anna guerrero is the editor of canva design school a blog and interactive tutorial series that empowers people to learn design annaisabella editor canva design schoolannaisabella write a comment credit getty images “what do consumers want”it’s a burning question marketers have long been asking but the way we’re now able to answer it is vastly different from in the era of pinup girls and dazzling automobile adswhy we’re living in the age of datawith audiences rapidly moving online the question is no longer ambiguous instead data allows marketers to gain complex insights into people’s feelings habits and emotions–essentially into what drives them to buythe best advertising of the decade then is the product of this shift–a carefully crafted narrative that tells the story consumers want to hear before they buypretty pictures simply don’t drive the same marketing traffic that they use to so don’t let your advertising efforts fall behind the times we know that visual marketing is powerful but psychologically driven visual marketing is unstoppablehere’s how  major brands crafted it captured the hearts and minds of their audiences and went viral take notes–you can use these techniques too dove “campaign for real beauty” deconstruct the normwhen unilever’s market research showed that in  only  percent of women considered themselves “beautiful” an advertising campaign was hatched working in tandem ogilvy  mather and edelman public relations set out to change that perception by deconstructing contemporary norms of beautyafter putting up billboards that asked people to reassess their perception of female beauty the campaign gained massive press attention talk shows women’s magazines even newspapers and news television shows began discussing modern female beauty standards as a result of the campaign this media exposure created approximately  times the revenue of paidfor media spots according to jonathan kolstad’s book unilever plc campaign for real beauty campaignby leveraging market research to understand how women perceived their beauty dove was able to create viral videos such as an interview piece with mothers and their daughters who discussed perceptions of female beauty with one another and a series of commercials “evolution” “onslaught” and “amy” that deconstructed this perceived norm that beauty is about being skinny and youngdove’s campaign went viral because it connected with people’s realization that female beauty norms are not always “normal” that the most beautiful person you can be is yourself and that if a brand message is resonant enough it can almost market itself burberry “the art of the trench” create a sense of community“the art of the trench” website was launched by burberry in  which showed everyday people sporting their burberry trench coats it found global success by creating a community of people who owned a burberry trench coat and created a desire to join this community from people who did not yet own one of the iconic jacketsby creating a clublike feeling through tapping into facebook connectivity interactive multimedia celebrity photographers and video integration burberry’s “the art of the trench” campaign quickly went viraleveryone wanted to see himself or herself on burberry’s site and many of those who didn’t have a trench coat were inspired to get one it also leveraged the popularity of “street style” photography and employed famous photographers who made amateur models feel like a part of a professional community as shown in the photos below old spice “the man your man could smell like” leverage market research and never panderwhen wieden kennedy conducted market research on bathroom products and found that it’s best to target women when selling men’s products women tend to make the purchasing choices for bathroom supplies old spice created “the man your man could smell like” previously men’s products had been marketed directly toward men most notably with axe body sprays and washes whose commercials showed attractive women running after the men who wore them however this approach turned women off to purchasing axe products while making men feel pandered to by commercials that equated their sexuality with body spraysthe old spice campaign however put handsome nfl athleteturnedactor isaiah mustafa into peculiar overthetop situations which was attractive to women as well as to men who found the rapidfire dialogue and humorous juxtaposition of mustafa’s nonchalant demeanor butting up against wildly changing sceneries and events to be clever and funny rather than panderingalthough any company could have unearthed this market research the execution was so fun and so simple–equating body soaps and deodorants to a suave sexy football player–that old spice quickly had a viral hit on its hands this campaign differentiated old spice as funloving brand that didn’t need to talk down to you red bull “stratos” engage in brand behaviorred bull maintains that sending the austrian daredevil felix baumbartner into space to become the first person to break the sound barrier without an engine was not meant as an advertisement “the red bull stratos project was first and foremost a scientific mission documented by our broadcast and editorial teams for seven years” red bull spokeswoman patrice radden told ad age “red bull stratos was not an advertising campaign”this alleged “antiad” where baumbartner flew through the stratosphere and landed at the roswell international air center in roswell new mexico was textbook brand behavior–equating red bull with adventurousness and a daredevil mindset–and for all intents and purposes was in fact an advertisement for the wellknown energy drink even as it skirted the boundaries of conventional advertisingcleverly red bull characterized “the jump” as an “event” not an “ad” so that when it was livestreamed on youtube it gained over  million viewers setting the record for the “live stream with the most concurrent views ever on youtube”viewers weren’t tuning in to watch an advertisement they were tuning in to watch a brand engage in the behaviors that aligned with its core values of adventure apple “get a mac” create a campaign templateapple used a basic template to showcase a single attribute of macs that pcs either don’t have or have worse versions of in this set of  commercials that ran for more than three years the ads featuring two comedians on a white background made it simple for apple to exemplify their special functions their ease of use and their security features in a way that didn’t seem didactic and boring but rather appeared to be a side note to a comedy sketchto appeal globally apple tailored the videos to the country in which they were broadcast by selecting popular actors whose roles tended to embody either nerdy or cool in the us john hodgman pc and justin long mac in the uk david mitchell pc and robert webb mac in japan the comedy duo called the rahmensthe campaign went viral because of the simplicity the countryspecific tailoring of the setup the fact that the  unique shorts were all available online and importantly because the tbwa agency and apple found a way to make what amounted to rattling off positive product attributes over a threeyear period feel continually fresh hilarious and something the consumer could look forward to or check out online all within a basic repeatable template newcastle “anna kendrick” position your brand as the outsidera “faux super bowl commercial” where anna kendrick fresh off her pitch perfect star breakout talked to her hairdresser about how she “almost” did a super bowl advertising campaign was hailed as one of the best super bowl commercials of the year even though newcastle didn’t have to buy any ad time they played it around the super bowl and as a native advertisement on gawker adweek called it an “ambush” and quoted newcastle brand director quinn kilbury as saying “it seemed like the obvious thing we had to do and unfair to the world if we didn’t… the super bowl is great the game is amazing everyone loves the game but it’s become much more about marketing in some ways and the overthetop ridiculousness that surrounds it”knowing they couldn’t compete with the advertising budget of a market leader like budweiser newcastle decided not to compete at allmad men‘s don draper once wisely said “if you don’t like what’s being said change the conversation” and that’s exactly what newcastle didby changing the conversation to how much of a tired marketing tool the super bowl has become and using the newly minted star power of kendrick in a nonsuper bowl commercial about the super bowl newcastle positioned itself as the cool outsider–and importantly the brand that “cool” consumers would want to be a part of dos equis “the most interesting man in the world” harness the power of slogans and phrasal templatesthe most interesting man in the world campaign which began in  also took a different approach to beer advertising rather than selling beer as a way to get attractive women to like you dos equis positioned itself as a conduit to interestingness and distinction “he is a man rich in stories and experiences much the way the audience hopes to be in the future” noted the marketing expert francis pruett of the ad’s main characterwhat made it so successful was the phrase that jonathan goldsmith who played the titular character employed at the end of every commercial “i don’t always drink beer but when i do i prefer dos equis” this launched the viral internet meme based on the phrasal template “i don’t always a but when i do i b” for instance “i don’t always look up things on my smartphone but when i do it’s to prove people wrong”the campaign succeeded because it wasn’t viewed as solely an advertisement but also as a second comedy clip that viewers knowing the phrasal templates could look forward to whenever the familiar colors and characters flickered on their screens once it turned into a meme the brand’s message spread wildly transcending the original ad while maintaining its protagonist thereby acting as a constant reminder of the product even in entirely new and unrelated situations it became not just a beer ad but an internet sensation that pushed forth the idea that dos equis was different and distinguished as well as youthful and websavvy nike “nike “ make everything socialthere’s no sport quite as isolating as longdistance running in which you’re by yourself for sometimes hours at a time but that didn’t stop nike from finding a way to make running social by creating nike and its fuelband which allow users to virtually train with star athletes share their times and goals with an online community and sync their progress and run maps to services like facebookthe social aspect didn’t just bring hardcore runners it democratized the nike brand and brought a whole new set of consumers novices“it turned a platform that was designed for runners” nick law global coo of rga told adage “into a platform that was designed for anyone that wanted to be active” by adding social aspects and online syncing capabilities to some of its core products nike was able to both keep its diehard athletes as well as attracting a wider public progressive insurance “flo” a light tone can do wondershow do you make something as inherently dull as automobile insure feel fresh and interesting geico has had a talking gecko for years and state farm has used an authoritative moralistic voice narrating dire situations but progressive took a different route casting standup comedian stephanie courtney as an overthetop overly madeup bubbly sales assistant named flo the ad grabbed viewers’ attention with a similar trick to the “get a mac” ads where one attribute of progressive was divulged in a sitcomy situation with flo leaving the audience with a zinger commentthe insight that made progressive’s commercial such a hit was in understanding the public perception of insurance companies as tiring bureaucratic and humorless by upending this notion progressive set itself apart from its competition and now has the most popular advertising campaign in the insurance market tidetogo “interview” stay true to your brand’s valuesin the advertisement spot “interview” a young man interviewing for a job gets an anthropomorphized spot on his shirt which talks to the interviewer stealing the attention away from the interviewee the young man uses his tidetogo pen to make it disappear and in doing so reclaims the attention of the interviewerthe ad is humorous but more important it is wholesome and appeals to the “family brand” dynamic that pg puts at the center of its identity ranked as the highest viewed ad in  according to youtube’s adblitz the ad went viral when pg asked consumers to create spoofs and variations on ad showing new scenarios in which the quickacting tidetogo pen could be used by staying true to the “family friendly” brand value of pg in the ad’s tone underlining the simplicity of the product and asking families to chime in with their own ideas tide created a sense of wholesome community while showcasing the simplicity and easeofuse of arguably their new flagship productwhat’s the secret behind viral ad campaignsthe best advertisements of the decade are in many ways beholden to the time in which they were produced eg you couldn’t use facebook integration for your brand before  yet the lessons are timelessidentifying and deconstructing norms leveraging your company’s best market research making your product social giving consumers a sense of community with your brand controlling your brand’s tone and positioning
