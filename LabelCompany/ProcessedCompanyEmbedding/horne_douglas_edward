developmentcontact us j douglas edwards the greatest sales trainer who ever lived    i was first exposed to j douglas edwards recordings by the best salesman i had ever met back about  in the ’s ’s and ’s j douglas edwards was the most indemand sales trainer in the country by fortune  companiesevery great sales trainer available today refers to j douglas edwards as “the godfather of all sales trainers” the current crop of toptier sales trainers were all students of jde they teach in their own words what they understood doug was saying if you think the students are good wait until you hear their teacherhis six most popular recordings started off as lp’s then cassettes and are now available as cds if my house was on fire and i could only save one thing if i believed i couldnt replace them i would save my j douglas edwards cds i have earned an extra  in my lifetime using what i learned from this great man on these six cdsmy two favorite cds are “ effective closes” and “ additional closes” known today as closes think about that for a minute  different ways to get a commitment from a buyer when you learn all  of his very effective closes and then apply them in a selling situation you won’t be a good salesman or even a great salesman you’ll be “totally lethal”doug says the reason we have so many people in sales today doing so poorly is they know two closes but only use oneonce you learn and apply “cashing objections” you’ll actually look forward to hearing an objection because you will then sell the buyer his own objection as the only reason for not buying the buyer believing he has you in a box you can’t get out of agrees once you’ve confirmed it’s the only obstacle to the completion of the sale you present the information that completely nullifies hisher confirmed one and only objection works every timeas edwards points out in “the people business” regardless of what you sell we’re all selling to people we’re really in the people business and people buy based on their values explore for their values and use the buyer’s own value system to help you close the sale“p’s  q’s” is all about prospecting and qualifying like everything else doug edwards teaches patterns of activity like nesting” that will keep your sales funnel full with qualified prospectshis last cd “questions are the answer” teaches the person who is asking the questions is in charge of the situation he has a unique way of demonstrating how your closing percentages will rise dramatically by asking the right questions i won’t spoil the way he demonstrates his point but i’ll guarantee once you hear it you’ll never forget the way he does itmy first set of jde recordings were on cassette tapes i played them constantly in my car as i made sales calls after a while i knew every word on every tape and i had internalized everything he said when i was making a sales call the words were in my voice but it was j douglas edwards who actually made all those sales for meeven today i keep all six of his recordings on my ipod and listen as i drivemany times i have compared these six cds to the equivalent of a college education in salesmanship it costs  own this incredible set of six cds however it could cost you a million or more in lifetime earnings if you don’t when you own these cds youll understand why todays toptier sales trainers are as good as they are in the history of sales trainers j douglas edwards is still “the ultimate master teacher”as a lifelong salesman i really do know from personal experience how valuable these recordings can be in  i was invited to make sales calls at the white house i sat in the decision makers office making my presentation it was my voice using dougs words and i ended up on  occasions providing the president and vicepresident a special service they had never been offered before best sale of my life thanks to what i learned from these cdsjim vaughan editor and ceowwwlearnfromthegiantscomjacksonville florida
