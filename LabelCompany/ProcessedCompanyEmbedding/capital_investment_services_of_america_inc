sophisticated process research yielding a consistent investment strategy while our philosophy may be simple our strategy is based on very sophisticated investment analysis we believe an investment strategy must perform well through a variety of market environments particularly over longer periods of time to help accomplish this goal we have identified certain characteristics of assets that often merit further analysis and review of these quality consistency and discipline are the key factors that frame our overall investment strategy blended portfoliosequitiesbonds download

because quality and consistency are themselves dynamic and can significantly change at different points in time disciplined active management of these variables is necessary if bonds are to fulfill their intended roles within a portfolio in our “toolkit” for actively managing the dynamic riskrewardcorrelation parameters are computer simulation scenarios we start by assessing the best and worst case scenarios for interest rates bond yields and economic conditions for the coming twelve months we use a computer simulation to calculate the total return potential for bonds of varying maturities and quality this information then forms the basis for managing portfolios around bonds that offer a low probability of loss should interest rates rise while also maximize the probability that bonds will deliver the desired correlation properties relative to other portfolio investments maintaining this disciplined approach helps us separate fundamentals from market noise more advantages of a blended approach our investment approach typically involves relatively low turnover within a portfolio therefore it tends to have the hidden benefits of both relative tax efficiency and low transaction costs and because every single investment is disclosed each month through a third party custodial statement client portfolios are fully transparent to them an essential and differentiating aspect of our bond management is the emphasis we place on selecting bonds that temper stock market volatility patient and disciplined adherence to this approach helps us preserve capital for clients also and perhaps most importantly during periods of stock market duress it is common that an investor’s anxiety is intensified by other financial factors for instance an investor may be fearful of the possibility of job loss or business setback for themselves or loved ones the value of their residences may decline they may observe a once popular business close the financial world may seem to be closing in around them a properly blended and managed portfolio can help mitigate the duress experienced during inevitable setbacks by helping preserve capital and mitigate anxiety this in turn may allow the discipline to get through difficult stretches and stay on course to accomplishing their specific investment objectives download pdf→our equity investment strategy is based on fundamental

in high quality bonds with modest interest rate risk characteristics we also actively manage the fundamental parameters of our clients’ bond investments quality our bond investment strategies are

to deliver effective outcomes for our clients we measure success in this regard relative to each client’s investment objectives longterm commitment helping to identify understand and more importantly commit to longterm objectives is critical to the success of our client relationships to facilitate the process some of the more common factors we evaluate together and then monitor continuously relate to time horizon risk tolerance income needs estate planning charitable gifting tax considerations changing events establishing the initial investment objectives is only the beginning for some investors life changing events may warrant reasonable adjustments to their investment plans for over  years we have helped clients steer their portfolios through changes in employment marital status legal disputes windfall gains and more as stewards of their investment assets we work with our clients to make adjustments when necessary while helping them preserve their longterm investment goals investing is often compared to a journey while most longterm investors understand this what is often underappreciated is the importance of the investment ride along the way the link here provides a demonstration of just how important the nature of the ride along the way may be in the process of attaining an investor’s objectives shift don’t switch studies have shown that asset mix – the amount of money allocated to stocks and bonds – is the primary determinant of investment returns in a portfolio over time so it stands to reason that getting the mix dialed into each client’s comfort zone from the beginning of the relationship and then making reasonable adjustments when appropriate are both critical factors in driving the effectiveness of outcomes the concept of reasonable adjustments is an important one studies show that in reality many investors fail to capture the publicly posted returns of their investment managers because they switch styles and strategies at just the wrong time others have shown that changes in style and strategies can cost more than the management fees they paid commitment to longterm objectives continuous monitoring and reasonable adjustments when and

walking the dogdownload pdf→ we recently were reminded of an investment analogy once offered by investment veteran ralph wanger we recount it below for we believe it adds some perspective to the current focus on “brexit” and the uncertainty it has triggered within global financial markets investing is like walking a dog on a leash wanger noted the dog never walks in a straight line but careens from side to side distracted by a squirrel here a fluttering leaf there a fire hydrant in yet another spot still it is the dog’s owner that ultimately guides the frenetic dog on the walk “what is astonishing” wanger said “is that almost all investors big and small seem to have their eye on the dog markets and not the owner the fundamental aspects of the underlying investment” in recent years investors have encountered a number of events that have for a time captivated the investment “dog’s” full attention to name just a few there was the “fiscal cliff” the ebola virus greece’s financial woes on at least a couple of occasions and before that cyprus still the us financial markets regained their footings as the economic expansion—while slow—continued on and most businesses went about their business of seeking to solve customer problems and satisfy their needs these fundamentals after all represent the dog’s “owner” and determine the ultimate investment direction in recent days the socalled brexit is capturing the full attention of the investment dog and while the uk voting to leave the european union may not be a trivial matter it will likely prove to be just one factor in the investment equation for most investors the relevant questions surrounding the brexit are in our estimation those that relate to the underlying fundamentals namely will it trigger a us recession will corporate earnings progress be materially impaired and will that unleash a stock “bear market” does it represent another  “lehman moment” where the collapse of the investment firm lehman brothers triggered the  financial panic we believe the answer to these questions is “no” although the us economy is mired in a slowgrowth mode a lack of excesses unsustainable private debt loads and rising inflation that typically make an economy vulnerable to recession remain generally lacking brexit may well cause the uk to suffer a recession and is not a favorable development in the short run for world growth but the us economic expansion should remain sufficiently resilient to withstand the effects meanwhile our banking system is better capitalized than it has been in many decades leverage in the financial system is nowhere near  levels and financial system liquidity is abundant today true the largest domestic banks which are not among our common stock holdings do have operations in the uk that may be impacted by brexit however any impact will likely be on the income statement side of these bank’s ledgers and not of materially impact to the soundness of their balance sheets more specifically the structure within our clients’ portfolios that own bonds remains conservative both with regards to interest rate risk and credit risk these attributes we believe will continue to allow bond investments to fulfill their dual portfolio roles of providing a worthwhile return while also tempering overall portfolio volatility and our stock investments continue to emphasize “growth” businesses bolstered by abundant free cash flow and strong balance sheets we believe these “compounding machines” will provide rewarding returns over the next several years…even as the market “dog” is apt to be distracted many times along the way we remain focused on understanding the current trends in fundamentals because it gives us the best probability for investment success

have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
