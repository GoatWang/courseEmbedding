results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering developing manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases we use precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative medicines for patients in specialty markets our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis or cf and advancing our research and development programs in other indications our two marketed products are orkambi lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor and kalydeco ivacaftor and we are currently seeking approval for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor which is a twodrug combination regimen for patients with cf in addition we are evaluating multiple triple combination regimens in patients with cf that include one or more nextgeneration cftr corrector compounds in phase  and phase  clinical trials cystic fibrosis orkambi and kalydeco are approved to treat approximately  of the  cf patients in north america europe and australia orkambi is approved as a treatment for approximately  patients who have two copies of the fdel mutation or fdel homozygous in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or cftr gene kalydeco is approved for the treatment of approximately  cf patients who have the gd mutation or other specified mutations in their cftr gene our goal is to develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to as many patients with cf as possible and will enhance the benefits that currently are being provided to patients taking our medicines if tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is approved we expect that it would provide an additional treatment option primarily to cf patients who are currently eligible for either orkambi or kalydeco if we are able to successfully develop a triple combination regimen that includes a nextgeneration cftr corrector compound including vx vx vx or vx we believe such regimen could potentially provide benefit to all cf patients who have at least one fdel mutation in their cftr gene approximately  of all cf patients this would include i the first treatment option that treats the underlying cause of cf for patients who have one copy of the fdel mutation in their cftr gene and a second mutation in their cftr gene that results in minimal cftr function or fdelmin patients and ii an additional treatment option to cf patients who are eligible for either orkambi kalydeco or if approved tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the first quarter of  we obtained positive results from two phase  clinical trials of tezacaftor a corrector compound in combination with ivacaftor the clinical trials demonstrated that the tezacaftorivacaftor combination provided statistically significant improvements in lung function percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second or ppfev in patients with cf  years of age and older who have certain mutations in their cftr gene the week evolve clinical trial evaluated tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in fdel homozygous patients with cf this clinical trial met its primary endpoint with a mean absolute improvement in ppfev through  weeks of  percentage points from baseline compared to placebo p   the second clinical trial expand was an week crossover clinical trial that evaluated the combination treatment in patients with cf who have one mutation that results in residual cftr function and one fdel mutation this clinical trial met the primary endpoints of absolute change in ppfev from baseline to the average of the week  and week  measurements with the tezacaftorivacaftor combination treatment demonstrating a mean absolute improvement of  percentage points compared to placebo p   and the ivacaftor monotherapy group demonstrating a mean absolute improvement of  percentage points compared to placebo p   across both clinical trials the tezacaftorivacaftor combination treatment was generally well tolerated based on these results we submitted a new drug application or nda to the us food and drug administration or fda and a marketing authorization application or maa to the european medicines agency or ema for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with cf  years of age and older who are fdel homozygous or who have one copy of the fdel mutation in their cftr gene and a second mutation in their cftr gene that results in residual cftr function in addition we have completed enrollment in a phase  clinical trial evaluating tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients  years of age or older who have one copy of the fdel mutation in their cftr gene and a second mutation that results in a gating mutation in the cftr gene that has been shown to be responsive to ivacaftor alone we expect to receive data from this clinical trial in the second half of  we also are conducting a phase  clinical trial of the tezacaftorivacaftor combination in patients with cf six to eleven years of age in the us the clinical trial is evaluating the safety and tolerability of the tezacaftorivacaftor combination in children who are homozygous for the fdel mutation and in children who have one copy of the fdel mutation and a gating or residual function mutation table of contents nextgeneration cftr corrector compounds in july  we obtained positive results from phase  and phase  clinical trials of three different triple combination regimens in patients with cf who have one copy of the fdel mutation in their cftr gene and a second mutation that results in minimal cftr function initial data from the phase  clinical trials showed mean absolute improvements in ppfev of  and  percentage points for vx mg qh and vx mg qh respectively in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor initial data from the phase  clinical trial showed mean absolute improvement in ppfev of  percentage points for vx in triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor additional data on vx and vx as well as data from ongoing or planned phase  clinical trials of vx and vx are expected in late  or early  pending additional data from these ongoing and planned clinical trials and discussions with regulatory agencies and a steering committee of global cf experts we plan to initiate pivotal development of one or more triple combination regimens in the first half of  table of contents crispr therapeutics ag or crispr pursuant to which we are collaborating on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using crisprcas gene editing technology parion pursuant to which we are developing enac inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary diseases moderna therapeutics inc or moderna pursuant to which we are bioaxone biosciences inc or bioaxone pursuant to which we are evaluating vx as a potential treatment for patients who have spinal cord injuries generally when we inlicense a technology or drug candidate we make upfront payments to the collaborator assume the costs of the program and agree to make contingent payments which could consist of milestone royalty and option payments depending on many factors including the structure of the collaboration the significance of the drug candidate that we license to the collaborators operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly for example the upfront payments and expenses incurred in connection with our crispr and moderna collaborations are being expensed as research expenses because the collaboration represents a small portion of these collaborators overall business crisprs and modernas activities unrelated to our collaborations have no effect on our consolidated financial statements parion and bioaxone are being accounted for as variable interest entities or vies and are included in our consolidated financial statements due to i the significance of the respective licensed programs to parion and bioaxone as a whole ii our power to control the significant activities under each collaboration and iii our obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant each of our consolidated vies is engaging in activities unrelated to our collaboration including in the case of parion seeking to develop novel treatments for pulmonary and ocular diseases the revenues and expenses unrelated to the programs we inlicense from our vies are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements in each case the activities unrelated to our collaboration represent approximately  of our total revenues and total expenses on an annual basis because we consolidate our vies we evaluate the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us on a quarterly basis changes in the fair value of these contingent future payments affect net income attributable to vertex on a dollarfordollar basis with increases in the fair value of contingent payments payable by us to a vie resulting in a decrease in net income attributable to vertex or an increase in net loss attributable to vertex and decreases in the fair value of contingent payments payable by us to a vie resulting in an increase in net income attributable to vertex or decrease in net loss attributable to vertex we have also outlicensed internally developed programs to collaborators who are leading the development of these programs these outlicense arrangements include our collaboration agreements with merck kgaa which is advancing four oncology research and development programs and janssen pharmaceuticals inc which is developing jnj formerly vx for the treatment of influenza pursuant to these outlicensing arrangements our collaborators are responsible for the research development and commercialization costs associated with these programs and we are entitled to receive contingent milestone andor royalty payments as a result we do not expect to incur significant expenses in connection with these programs and have the potential for future collaborative andor royalty revenues resulting from these programs regulatory compliance table of contents management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from thirdparty payors including governmental organizations in the united states and exus markets in the united states we continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states in europe and other exus markets we are working to obtain government reimbursement for orkambi on a countrybycountry basis because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments to date we have reached a pricing and reimbursement agreement for orkambi with several european countries including germany ireland and italy and remain in negotiations with several others consistent with our experience with kalydeco when it was first approved we expect reimbursement discussions in exus markets may take a significant period of time table of contents week efficacy data in fdelmin

will provide prepared remarks this evening stuart arbuckle chief commercial officer will join us for qa we will make forwardlooking statements on this conference call these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in todays press release our k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission these statements including those regarding the ongoing development and commercialization of kalydeco and orkambi vertexs other cystic fibrosis programs and vertexs future financial performance are based on managements current assumptions actual outcomes and events could differ materially information regarding our use of gaap and nongaap financial measures and a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap is available in the financial results press release i would also refer you to slide  of tonights webcast i will now turn the call over to dr jeff leiden jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc thanks michael good evening   is an important year for vertex and weve made significant progress towards achieving our longterm vision of treating all people with cf as we enter this year we were focused on continuing to increase the number of people eligible for and being treated with our approved medicines as well as generating important data from multiple combination medicines across our cf pipeline let me briefly review our recent progress in meeting these objectives first the fda recently approved kalydeco for more than  people with cf ages  and older who have  of  residual function mutations and we continue to work closely with the fda to obtain approval for more than  additional people who have other residual function mutations responsive to kalydeco kalydeco continues to be a transformative medicine and has now labeled to treat approximately  people with cf globally tonight we are reiterating our kalydeco revenue guidance second weve now reached reimbursement agreements in ireland and italy for orkambi in people ages  and older with two copies of the fdel mutation we continue to discuss reimbursement with other countries including france the netherlands and the united kingdom and remain committed to expanding the eligibility for and access to orkambi globally tonight we also reiterated our guidance for orkambi third based on the positive phase  data we announced earlier this year we recently submitted an nda to the fda and an maa to the european medicines agency for the tezacaftorivacaftor combination in people with cf ages  and older we anticipate acceptance of the nda and the maa later this year fourth we recently shared positive phase  and phase  results from three of our triple combination regimens in people with cf who have at least one fdel mutation these results included the first data to demonstrate the potential to treat the underlying cause of cf and had many patients who have a severe and difficult to treat type of this disease we also demonstrated that the addition of a nextgeneration corrector to tezacaftor and ivacaftor significantly increases fev and fdel homozygous patients throughout the rest of this year we will be evaluating additional data from these and other studies and i look forward to updating you on our plans for pivotal development of our triple combination regimens that may have the potential to treat up to  of cf patients we expect to begin pivotal development in the first half of  for one or two of our four nextgeneration correctors and lastly earlier this week we added ctp to our pipeline of cf medicines through completing our asset purchase agreement with concert pharmaceuticals ctp has the potential to be used as part of future oncedaily combination regimens that treat the underlying cause of cf and we are already working to integrate the potentiator into one of our triple combination regimens based on our significant progress this year we are wellpositioned to achieve our longstanding goal to create medicines that fundamentally alter the progression of cf for all patients and in doing so meet our financial goal of delivering sustainable longterm revenue and earnings growth for vertex with that ill now turn the call over to ian to discuss our financials ian f smith  vertex pharmaceuticals inc thanks jeff and good evening to everyone tonight i will discuss the key aspects of our second quarter  financials and i will also review our  fullyear financial guidance revenues first total cf product revenues of  million in the second quarter of  represent a  increase compared to the  million we recorded in the second quarter of  and a  million increase compared to the  million we recorded in the first quarter of  we continue to see revenue growth as we treat more patients with our approved medicines for orkambi we reported second quarter  product revenues of approximately  million an increase of  million compared to the first quarter of  this increase was driven by continued uptake of the medicine globally as well as the timing of both patients and pharmacy orders of approximately  million in advance of the th of july holiday these shipments will likely impact revenues in the third quarter of  second quarter kalydeco sales were  million compared to  million for the first quarter of  we estimate there was approximately  million of inventory stocking at quarter end in advance of july  holiday our second quarter  nongaap combined rd and sga expenses were  million compared to  million in the second quarter of  and compared to  million in the first quarter of  these increases are primarily due to the continued acceleration and broad advancement of our cf medicines in development and in particular our portfolio of triple combination regimens this revenue expense profile resulted in a nongaap net profit for the second quarter of  of  million or  per diluted share compared to nongaap net profit of  million or  per diluted share for the second quarter of  and compared to a  million or  per diluted share for the first quarter of  the significant growth yearoveryear in net profit was largely driven by the strong growth in the total cf product revenues during the second quarter of  the company generated significant cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately  billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities now turning to our fullyear financial guidance we continue to expect total cf product revenues of  billion to  billion in  for orkambi we continue to expect  billion to  billion in net product revenues our actual revenues will be determined by the continued uptake of orkambi in the markets where its reimbursed as well as the completion of additional reimbursement agreements throughout europe if we are successful in gaining reimbursements in france by the end of  it would be a large contributor to our revenue growth there continues to be uncertainty after the timing on when these discussions will be completed as to kalydeco we continue to expect  million to  million in net product revenues which includes the recent approval in patients with residual function mutations we continue to have productive discussions with the fda to obtain approval for more than  people who have other residual function mutations responsive to kalydeco now to operating expenses we have made significant investments and generated compelling data across our cf pipeline this year and we now expect combined nongaap rd and sga expenses of  billion to  billion for  this updated guidance reflects the progression of our cf portfolio including the acceleration of phase  studies for vx and vx preparation for pivotal studies for our portfolio of triple combination regimens and investment to develop ctp as part of future triple combination regimens with our continued revenue growth the management of our operating expenses we are well on track to deliver a financial profile that includes high operating margins and sustainable earnings growth with that i will open up the line to questions questionandanswer session operator and our first question comes from the line of matthew harrison with morgan stanley your line is now open matthew k harrison  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks very much for taking the question i guess id just like to ask about the progression of pricing and reimbursement in europe youve obviously made some progress with some countries and yet some of the large ones including france seem to be taking longer can you just talk about to the extent you are willing – what items are still needing to be discussed and i guess what we should think about in terms of that and broadly i guess the nature of the question here is youve obviously got orkambi now but theres visibility towards teziva and then triple combos and does that influence any of the conversation and perhaps take longer to complete thanks stuart a arbuckle  vertex pharmaceuticals inc great thanks matt its stu here ill try and address your question its got a number of different elements to it as you said we have made good progress in the first half of this year reaching pricing and reimbursement agreements in germany ireland italy austria luxemburg and denmark and as you said were in active negotiations with other countries including france the uk and the netherlands and where we are in those discussions ill refer you back to the comments weve made previously these discussions tend to have three phases theres a clinical benefit assessment the pharmacoeconomic assessment and then youre into the pricing discussions and were through those first two theres really no debate in those markets in europe about the clinical benefits of orkambi were really in the pricing and reimbursement discussions and as ian mentioned in his prepared remarks unfortunately the exact timing of when those are going to conclude is uncertain just because theyre not directly within our control as to the potential impact of newer agents in development on those discussions what id say to you is that were very pleased that in ireland and italy where we reached agreements in may after the teziva data was available those countries still saw fit to do what we think is the right thing make a transformative medicine like orkambi available to patients as soon as possible because it treats the underlying cause of the disease and we know therefore that its important for patients to be treated as early as possible and were certainly going to be continuing to make that case to the existing authorities who are still not providing access for patients in their countries operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of geoff meacham with barclays your line is now open geoffrey meacham phd  barclays capital inc hey guys a couple of questions for you obviously with the data thus far in the triple you can expand the addressable population but i wanted to ask you about the nonsense mutation and some of the splicing mutations i know clearly you guys have the alliance here with crispr and to look at some of those but maybe just talk a little bit about what the strategy is there do you have technologies inhouse to look at more nonsense mutation patients or is it just going to focus on deltaf single and double and then i have a followup jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah thanks geoff this is jeff leiden ill take two parts for your questions we actually view splice and nonsense quite differently so as you know and as ian said i think were in very productive discussions with the fda around the splice mutations most of those produce normal fee of care  but much lower amounts and our in vitro data and our clinical data has clearly shown that they respond to kalydeco and by the way also to teziva and so the imperative there is to get kalydeco monotherapy approved for those patients as soon as possible and then follow that with teziva and were confident that we will be able to that so thats splice nonsense mutations as you point out are quite different they are obviously not going to respond to cftr modulators because there is no protein there and we have several approaches there the first of which is the enac inhibitor so one of the reasons were interested in studying the enac inhibitors thats vx is because they as you know function by a different mechanism that doesnt require functional cftr protein and so well have a look at the first data as you know in the second half of this year but thats sort of mechanism number one to get at the nonsense mutations and as you point out mechanisms two are genetic approaches such as crispr and moderna were making some nice progress in cell lines we do have cell assays that allow us to look at those in both hbe cells and other cells and the key issue there is going to be delivery i actually think the gene editing and the ability for rna to make cftr is a relatively straightforward problem the tough problem here is delivery and were working on that in parallel and as weve said we do think thats going to take a number of years to bring forward into the clinic geoffrey meacham phd  barclays capital inc okay and a followup question more on the commercial side and i have asked you guys this a couple of times before but i just want to see if theres any update clearly the market is us western europe and australia but i wanted to see i think at one point you guys have talked about opening an office down in latin america or other countries that maybe have a founder effect where you have populations that are well beyond the  that everyone puts up as the number so is there – maybe just help us with kind of where you are with that kind of more of the global piece stuart a arbuckle  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah geoff youre correct we have established an office in são paulo in brazil as a potential sort of regional hub for latin america and youre right there are numbers of patients in there the level of newborn screening and the maturity of registries there is perhaps as you might expect not quite as advanced than it is here in the us and in parts of western europe and so the exact numbers of patients and indeed their specific genotypes which we would anticipate being different in terms of distribution than it is in the us and europe is not as well defined and so much of our efforts over the last year or so has been working with the various cf societies and physicians in those markets to try and better understand the size of the potential patient population there and the specific genotypes that they have so that we can work out which of our medicines is best placed to help those patients out so thats kind of the phase that were at there and i would say stay posted well kind of update you as we make more progress from a commercial point of view there jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc and from a regulatory point of view geoff it is our intention to go ahead and get these products registered there theres a very formal way to do that and were well into that process geoffrey meacham phd  barclays capital inc got you okay thanks guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of terence flynn with goldman sachs your line is now open terence flynn phd  goldman sachs  co llc hi thanks for taking the question i was just wondering if you guys could comment on thoughts on uptake of teziva into the fdel homozygous patients with low baseline function i know that is been an area where there are some concern around use of orkambi do you think teziva will be used there or do you think those patients would most likely wait until the triple combo is available thanks a lot stuart a arbuckle  vertex pharmaceuticals inc terence hi its stu here thanks for the question let me first talk a little bit more broadly about how we see teziva fitting in we think teziva because of the benefit risk profile that it has really has a great opportunity to allow us and physicians to treat more patients with cf and thats because we think given the benefit risk profile where we know the efficacy is very good but also the safety and tolerability are also very good we think it will be applicable to a number of populations firstly those who have discontinued orkambi many of whom discontinued for adverse events we think thats a population that physicians and the patients themselves will be very keen to be retreated with a cftr modulator we also know those patients who have never been treated with orkambi some of whom because the patient andor physician were concerned about the benefit risk profile of orkambi and then thirdly outside the us in particular the residual function population where we dont have kalydeco monotherapy approved is another population where based on the phase  data that we showed in march with tezacaftorivacaftor we believe well also be able to get additional patients on a cftr modulator so overall for teziva we see the biggest benefit for patients and physicians is being able to offer cftr modulator to more people with the disease in terms of exactly how it might be considered for those with low fevs clearly one of the major concerns physicians and patients have there was the bronchoconstriction side effect that we see from lumacaftor weve known about that with lumacaftor for a while and the result weve been very diligently and looking at whether tezacaftor has that same property we know from all of our phase  data from our phase  data from looking at both adverse events postdose spirometry the teziva does not have that same adverse events and therefore i think its going to be a very popular option for patients with a low fev terence flynn phd  goldman sachs  co llc great thanks a lot operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of geoff porges with leerink partners your line is now open geoffrey c porges phd  leerink partners llc thanks very much and thanks for the questions a couple of strategy questions first stuart could you just talk about what success youre having with the full portfolio contracts and more or less fixed pricing as you look ahead to now multiple generations potentially five different product offerings over time is that a model that you think that you can deploy globally or is it just in very selected markets and what sort of reaction are we getting and then secondly ian your balance sheet is shaping up nicely and we expect it to continue to improve and you are diversifying your portfolio across products is there a possibility that you might be able to take on some leverage and sort of free up additional capital from your balance sheet in that way thanks stuart a arbuckle  vertex pharmaceuticals inc so geoff ill take your first question so just for everybodys clarity on the call the approach that geoffs referring to is an agreement that we reached earlier this year in ireland where essentially we have an agreement which is a longterm agreement covers populations of patients in this case those who are homozygous for the fdel mutation all those who are one of the approved kalydeco mutations and essentially looks at that patient population all the way down to the age zero and essentially includes in the agreement both the currently approved medicines kalydeco and orkambi will include patients for orkambi when the indications extended the lower age groups but will also include new vertex medicines in those specific patient population i would say to you geoff that since that agreement was put in place and in particular since both the teziva data and now the nextgen data which makes it very clear to everybody how close we are to being able to develop medicines that treat the underlying cause of disease in  of patients theres been a lot of interest in discussing similar type of patient andor portfolio contracts so were certainly very keen to be flexible if thats what countries want to do were certainly as weve demonstrated in ireland very open to doing that i personally believe its a real win win win that arrangement its a win for the irish government its a win for vertex and most importantly its a win for patients in ireland and so were certainly very open to doing that kind of agreement in any country were in obviously early stages of discussions with newer countries along those lines and certainly that theres a lot of interest there whether well actually be able to get turn that interest into an agreement time will tell and i think ian will handle the question on balance sheet geoffrey c porges phd  leerink partners llc thank you ian f smith  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah so hi geoff how you doing so first of all to the cash just to give you a couple of points of where we are currently on our financial position we have cash of close to  billion and we are cash flow positive each quarter now and so that balance continues to increase id also point out that we actually do already have a revolver facility and so we have access to up to  million it currently stands at  million but we can expand it to  million so when you have the  million debt capacity at the moment on the balance sheet that we have not yet drawn down on plus the  billion of cash and a positive cash flow were in a very nice position to think about how we allocate that cash and how we apply it obviously were already making choices of our revenue stream as it grows to allocate internally and that is going into rd and it goes beyond to cf these days it goes into other disease areas and im sure before we finish this call there will be a number of questions about how are we progressing beyond cf and then as ive said on call previously that cash can now – thats on the balance sheet and also the leverage and the increasing leverage and the increasing availability of cash we can apply outside the company and we have three basic strategies there and were very active as shown actually by the announcement yesterday so one of those strategies and the priority is still lets take a look at everything thats complementary in cystic fibrosis to our approach and we actually just closed on the acquisition of ctp yesterday another strategy is for us to look at other scientific footprints or scientific platforms or modalities and how they may allow us to treat diseases in different ways than just through small molecule approaches and weve done both moderna and the crispr collaboration in the last year or so that have advanced our approaches in those areas and then what is also emerging is how we may just broaden our pipeline beyond cf with earlier stage type deals that relate to asset acquisitions or targets in ip acquisitions and knowledge and assays and small matype ideas that we look at as well were very sensitive to looking at the capital structure of the company were still progressing and i think our focus is on earlier stage assets of high science in disease areas that are consistent with cystic fibrosis geoffrey c porges phd  leerink partners llc great thanks very much thats very helpful ian operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael yee with jefferies your line is now open michael j yee  jefferies llc great thanks for the question my question was on the concert molecule which of course you just closed on yesterday what are the next steps how are you thinking about developing that could that be ready for one of the triples to start next year or what are the things you need to do there in discussions with the fda and the other question was in terms of your ongoing triples you have now in phase  how good you feel about the therapeutic window in terms of going up and seeing higher efficacy without the risk of any undue side effects thanks jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah hi michael its jeff welcome back by the way michael j yee  jefferies llc thanks jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc nice to hear your voice again on the call so ill take both of those questions so ctp as youll remember is deuterated ivacaftor and the rationale there was to potentially get to a onceaday regimen – triple regimen because both vx and vx are consistent with oncedaily dosing from what we know now about their pk and of course tezacaftor is consistent with oncedaily dosing whereas ivacaftor kalydeco is not its a twiceaday regimen and so were very pleased to have closed the transaction weve already been actually working very hard on incorporating this molecule into a triple its a little early for me to give you a precise date but if you ask me could we come up with a triple regimen containing ctp that was once a day and begin a pivotal trial in  id say the answer from what i know today is likely yes i want to emphasize that were not going to wait for that certainly it is our intention to get the best regimen to patients as quickly as possible and so the first regimen almost certainly will use ivacaftor kalydeco and be a twiceaday regimen and well follow that likely with a onceaday regimen and we also have the opportunity to bridge back later to substitute in the ivacaftor all of that as you say requires some discussion with regulators and it also requires a little more data on our part were certainly not going to jump into a phase  trial of the ivacaftor until we have enough efficacy safety tolerability and pk data to make sure that we know the dose and we know how to put it together with the other agents but again we think thats a relatively short journey and that we could have such a regimen in pivotals next year and then your second question michael j yee  jefferies llc and then the triple – yeah jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah the triple and really your question was about therapeutic window and as we said last week one of the things that was the most important for us to see in all four regimens actually was the very favorable safety and tolerability profile and what that meant to us is that we could begin to expand dosing upwards and so were doing that as you know in at least three of the regimens so in vx the initial data was at a  milligram and  milligram dose we are already expanding that up to  milligrams and those patients are being dosed and so well see whether we can essentially wring more efficacy out of vx with that same safety and tolerability profile some suggestion we may be able to because if you look back at that data there does seem to be a clear dose response in fev between  milligrams and  milligrams with vx youll remember were at  bid and so the phase  trial of vx which is just beginning will incorporate higher doses up to  milligrams a day and the vx dosing will also go up so with those three molecules we are going to try to increase dose looking for maximum benefit with a very favorable safety and tolerability profile and as we said last week we hope to have all that data converge towards the end of this year and early next year and that will allow us to pick not only the best regimen or regimens but the best doses michael j yee  jefferies llc thanks jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc sure operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of phil nadeau with cowen  company your line is now open phil nadeau phd  cowen  co llc good afternoon thanks for taking my question and its actually kind of a followup to the last one thats on data disclosure i think concert had guided to you getting a monotherapy data for ctp out by the end of this year is that still likely now thats in your hands and then second jeff your answer to the question that you just gave it sounds like therell be more disclosures on vx vx and vx either late this year or early next is that a correct interpretation is that when well see the next data or are there interim releases that are possible jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah thanks phil ill take the first part and ian i think can take the disclosure question so with respect to ctp for monotherapy were actually not planning to develop ctp for monotherapy given that we believe that  of the patients will go on to a triple regimen so were really interested in as part of a onceaday triple regimen we will get some interesting i think pk data potentially from that study but for us now its all about incorporating it into triple therapy and figuring out how to do that which dose making sure theres efficacy in the safety tolerability profile it doesnt require a lot of patients but we will be doing that before we jump into pivotal trials so i wouldnt focus on the monotherapy trial because i dont think thats where were headed ian may be you talk about the disclosure ian f smith  vertex pharmaceuticals inc and phil as we disclosed a couple of weeks ago were looking at our nextgeneration triple combination as a portfolio of medicines and given we are choosing to complete each one of the phase  studies of each molecule we see our next disclosure is when weve completed that – all the studies in phase  so when we completed the phase  for vx vx vx and vx we anticipate that being early  well be able to not only give you the data well be also – also be able to tell you how were thinking about which molecule were taking into phase  in the first half of  so we continue to view it as a portfolio so wed like to keep it to a portfolio disclosure and we anticipate that being early  phil nadeau phd  cowen  co llc thanks thats very helpful and congratulations again on the progress ian f smith  vertex pharmaceuticals inc thank you phil operator thank you our next question comes from the line of cory kasimov with jpmorgan your line is now open cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc hey good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question so ian you alluded to more questions on bd and i do in fact want to followup now the bigger picture question on this front so recognizing this is all still quite fresh but theres the recent progress in substantial derisking on the triple front impact how the company thinks about business development going forward in terms of investing outside of cf in other words do you have more confidence or perhaps change the approach to building outside of your core franchise given whats likely more predictable future – the future track of cf revenues or these kind of topics that are mutually exclusive thanks jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah cory this is jeff its a great question id certainly give you two different types of responses let me step back weve actually been working on whats next after cf which is one part of your question for quite hard now for a couple of years and we sort of view it as a twopart approach first of all whats beyond cf in terms of trying to find disease areas really is weve been consistent with what weve learned in cf that is were really only interested in transformative medicines and serious diseases that we can sell into the specialty areas with relatively low sga which will then allow us to recycle most of our opex back into rd thats the model and were going to stick to that model as we move beyond cf and then we view internal research and bd as essentially complementary often even looking at the same diseases using some internal programs and some external programs and so for instance weve talked about sickle cell disease as a program that were interested in because it does fit that profile we have an internal small molecule program or several of them actually in sickle cell disease we have our collaboration with crispr in sickle cell disease and we may even look at additional outside programs so this hybrid combination of inside investment and outside investment is the way were going to go at this for the majority of diseases now with respect to your question about the strengthening financial position and how does that change our perspective i think the key word that you said which is the word we use is confidence as this financial position strengthens we have more confidence not only in our balance sheet today but importantly in our balance sheet tomorrow and so thats going to let us i do believe give us a lot more financial firepower let us do more deals and potentially larger as ian said were not in the business of buying revenue in  or  were not going to go out and buy marketed products but we are very interested in diversifying our earlier stage pipeline with these kinds of transformative medicines and i think you can expect more of that as our confidence is growing significantly cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc great thats helpful thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of carter gould with ubs your line is now open carter gould  ubs securities llc hi guys good afternoon thanks for taking the question and congrats again on all the progress i guess the segue to beyond cf – a question for jeff or david clinicaltrialsgov says the vx phase  study supposed to read out in q i guess one is that the right timeline and two how should we be thinking about what you want to see to advance into a phase  in acute pain thank you jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah so thanks for asking let me again just take a step back for those who arent familiar with vx this is our nav  inhibitor this a novel mechanism – pain mechanism as you know we recently reported positive phase  data in osteoarthritis which was really the first proofofconcept for this mechanism frankly in pain and whats important here and what we said before is we dont view pain as one disease mechanistically we actually view it as several different diseases so there is the inflammatory pain that we saw in osteoarthritis theres acute pain theres neuropathic pain in particular and what wed like to – what we are doing at this point i think wed like to do is to explore this molecule in all three of those so we have the positive readout in oa were currently involved in an acute pain study which is a bunionectomy study and we do hope thatll readout later this year next year and then the third study will be a neuropathic pain study which will start i hope later this year that takes a little longer so itll likely be  months to  months more once it starts before we read that out again depending on enrollment once we have the profile of molecule then i think were in a position to really decide a how do we best bring it to patients which patients do we need a partner for some of these obviously community acquired pain is not something were going to do and how to best monetize it as well for vertex and so as we accumulate the profile of the compound well keep you informed with each of these trails and thatll lead to the decision about how to take it forward which is really your question carter gould  ubs securities llc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of robyn karnauskas with citi your line is now open robyn karnauskas phd  citigroup global markets inc hi guys thank you so given that youve spend almost a  billion on rd and i know you said a majority of that is cf can you quantify right now what percentage is noncf and if youre thinking about – youre starting to think about expanding beyond cf when do you think the cf spend might begin to taper given that even clinical trials are running are a little smaller than before so can you help us understand how you expect the rd spend to evolve a little bit and could you see an expansion in the noncf sooner than what we anticipate thanks ian f smith  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah thanks for the question robyn some of the – lets say the number that im about to give you might surprise you a little so first of all if you take rd lets split it up into r and lets split it up into d so firstly r we have three research sites one of those sites is focused on cystic fibrosis there it is focused on other targets as well but it is primarily our cystic fibrosis site and theyve done excellent work as you know out in san diego there are two others sites that are not focused on cf so already were spending well beyond  of our research investment beyond cf and on disease areas that again weve touched down on this call that are similar to cf but we have a research strategy that goes beyond cf already and weve been doing that now for a couple of years and we hope to start seeing some productive results in taking molecules into the clinics of diseases that you may be familiar with and they should start to see that maybe later this year and certainly into early part of next year coming out of research so were already – if you wanted me to put a percentage on it because its fungible but its probably around  thats beyond cf given how we carve up our research activities for development it is a little bit of a different story oh and by the way on the research were committed to maintaining that kind of approach i dont think thats going to change in the near term given we continue to invest in cf and id also say in research we start to supplement it with external relationships such as crispr and moderna and we have an investment there as well when we look at development development is principally an investment in cystic fibrosis right now as you may imagine we have a full pipeline ranging from phase s all the way through to phase s and so the principal investment in development is actually towards cf and it goes well beyond just clinical trials as well there is a heavy support in terms of formulation manufacturing medical affairs and regulatory and so i would say probably  of our development spend is towards cystic fibrosis and again i dont see that the investment in cystic fibrosis tailing off significantly for another three four maybe five years you have to understand as we get approval for medicines in  and older we immediately are thinking about how we get approval for medicines in  through  were thinking about  through  were thinking about how we gather longer term data and build our registry data to support the longterm outcome of our medicines of treating this disease long term so we need to maintain that support for the medicines were creating to treat cf i do see the investment starting to increase beyond cf but that would be a function of those creating opportunity and jeff just talked you through the pain opportunity we have to see how that plays out but you will start to see new ideas coming to the clinic and well start investing in those but itll be earlier stage so it wont be a significant spend in the next two or three years it would grow if they progress down the pipeline robyn karnauskas phd  citigroup global markets inc great thank you michael partridge  vertex pharmaceuticals inc operator we have time for two more questions operator certainly and our next question comes from the line of ying huang with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open ying huang phd  bank of america merrill lynch hi  thanks for taking the question maybe a followup on the qd kalydeco you got from concert it doesnt sound like its ready for phase  when you start the triple combo next year but once that compound is ready do you think you have to run a headtohead study versus the bid kalydeco you have to show the comparability and also do you think fda would want to see that data or you think its just completely different separate study just to get that qd of kalydeco through and then secondly maybe for ian if i add the q orkambi and then q orkambi revenue just flat line for the rest of the year were already at high end of your guidance does that mean this is still very conservative for the  billion to  billion guidance for orkambi thank you jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc yeah maybe ill take the first one and ian will take the second one yeah with respect to ctp i would think about it as two stages stage  is really more us accumulating sufficient internal data to be confident both about the efficacy tolerability safety and dose thats a small set of studies that supplements what concert has already provided so that we can feel comfortable before we go into phase  that we know the profile of the drug and we know the appropriate dose as part of a triple so were planning to do those kinds of studies over the next months as i said and once we accumulate that data well make a decision about taking that triple with the – with ctp forward and as i said i think its doable well im not promising it because were just learning about the compound to get that done to be in pivotals next year then your question about the fda is a different question so i would think about that quite simply as are we going to need a phase  trial there with the iva and is it our intention to do that if we incorporate it into a new triple we would then run pivotal trials there to get that approved by the fda if we already have a triple approved and later on we want to substitute it back thats a different story thats probably more of a bioequivalent story but regardless were going to need data both efficacy and some safety tolerability data dosing data before we dive into phase  ian f smith  vertex pharmaceuticals inc and ying thanks for the question so as you saw we are continuing to reiterate our guidance at  billion to  billion for orkambi but youre correct if you do the math weve had a strong first half of the year and if you double up that revenue rate without growth it does put you in the mid to slightly in the upper part of our range and so i can confirm that we do not anticipate being in the low part of our range but where we fall in the mid up to higher part of the range is a function of a number of things i would point out that firstly more acutely in short term we did note in the prepared remarks that q was benefited by some inventory stocking prejuly for holiday and on orkambi in particular it was  million and i know you know how that works but that means youre taking  million out of q adding it to q but that does mean a  million difference between q and q and so these things do matter when youre trying to pro rata quarters to try and get a fullyear run rate and one of the other things that we need to see how it plays out we did see a little bit of a summer slowdown last year and it was more around compliance of medicines and there was lower compliance which resulted in less revenues so we need to see how that plays out we have a number of programs in place that were trying to help patients be more compliant this year and – but we do need to see how that plays out and obviously something thats really important in terms of where we fall in the range is our launches in the new markets of ireland and italy but also whether we gain reimbursement in countries like france so where we fall in the range yeah we dont anticipate being in the low end be in the mid end and how we climb up from the mid end is really a function of performance and thats why were maintaining our guidance ying huang phd  bank of america merrill lynch thank you operator thank you and our last question comes from the line of adam walsh with stifel your line is now open adam walsh phd  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi thanks so much for fitting me in i got a couple of quick ones first for ian just for our modeling purposes can you breakout the orkambi us and eu revenues and then one quickly for jeff on slide – i believe its  you talked about obtaining worldwide rights to ctp but then you also mentioned other assets related to the treatment of cf if you could just elaborate on the other assets part if you are referring to something specifically let us know thank you stuart a arbuckle  vertex pharmaceuticals inc adam its stuart here on the orkambi geographic split its approximately  so of the  million globally we recognized  million of that within the us the balance  million was international jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc and then on the ctp on the slide what were really about is there was some additional ip and of course knowledge about ctp some additional ip around cf and we acquired all of it as part of this transaction adam walsh phd  stifel nicolaus  co inc excellent thanks so much jeffrey m leiden md phd  vertex pharmaceuticals inc thanks michael partridge  vertex pharmaceuticals inc okay operator thank you and i would now like to turn the call back to michael partridge vice president of investor relations for any closing
