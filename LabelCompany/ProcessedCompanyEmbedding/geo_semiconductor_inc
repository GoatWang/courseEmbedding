corporation geo semiconductor inc and on semiconductor corporation has introduced a lowpower batteryoperated video doorbell reference design capable of streaming high definition or hd video and twoway telephony quality audio over wifi networks developed in response to the rapidly growing iot market for videoaudio streaming products in the home the reference design platform speeds time to market and reduces product development cost and cycle times for original equipment manufacturers oems through this partnership customers benefit from the leadership each company has shown in its respective field geo semiconductors low power highly integrated video encoder solutions on semiconductors image sensor solutions and gainspans expertise in lowpower cloudconnected wifi solutions the solution features geos powerefficient max video compression chip and on semiconductors ar cmos image sensor integrated with gainspans gsm low power wifi module on a small printed circuit board the gainspan gsm serves as the system host controller running embedded streaming protocols and application software also developed by gainspan the platform delivers crisp p x hd video at  frames per second and utilizes the maxs internal audio processing features to deliver high quality full duplex voice audio with onboard acoustic echo cancellation and noise reduction the platform is an ideal low power and costeffective reference design for internetconnected video doorbell and smart camera products the platforms wireless connectivity features and software enable video and audio streaming directly to smartphones that use either ios or android operating systems or through cloud connections the solution comprises hardware and software needed for engineers to quickly and simply add video and audio streaming capabilities into their iotbased product designs thereby reducing development costs and accelerating time to market the gsadkvideofd audiop adk is accompanied by a complete software suite plus a series of sophisticated mobile application programming interfaces apis and mobile demo applications for android and ios devices the adk is available through gainspan and its distributors central to this solution is on semiconductors ar inch optical format cmos image sensor which delivers superior imaging quality in low light conditions using its  x  activepixel array this device has the capacity to capture  megapixel mp still images it also incorporates advanced onchip camera features such as columnrow subsampling windowing mirroring and snapshot modes edimax chooses geo semiconductor inc for smallest fisheye camera jan   geo semiconductor inc announced that the geo gc camera processor has been selected to power edimax’s smallest fisheye camera geo’s gc camera processor integrates its patented ewarp® core this fully programmable geometry processing engine dewarps wide angle field of views adjusts perspective and rotational misalignment in real time the gc also integrates geo’s patented h and mjpeg compression engines that support resolutions up to  megapixel with full hd p output the gc supports multistreaming protocols that deliver the high quality output by adapting resolution and frame rate to network bandwidth the smallest fisheye camera can fully replace current mechanical ptz cameras to avoid motor repair concerns edimax has developed an iosandroid app which supports a rich user experience the app supports fisheye view panoramic view eptz electronic pan tilt and zoom as well as patrol mode for nvr applications this camera also supports dmic for good voice
