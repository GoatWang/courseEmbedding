stepped from school bus if the district followed safety procedures  latimes advertisement you are here lat home→collections→accidental deathsdiscrepancies mar account of death of boy   accident parents say that their son wouldnt have been killed as he stepped from school bus if the district followed safety proceduresapril  mark i pinsky  times staff writer laguna niguel — the school district said thursday it is investigating the death of a yearold struck by a truck after he got off a school bus an accident his parents said could have been avoided if the district had followed safety proceduresthomas e lanni  was hit by a pickup truck on april  as he crossed aliso niguel road he died at the hospitaltwo days after the funeral thomas w lanni  said he was infuriated by an account of his sons death released after the accident by the capistrano unified school districtits incomprehensible to me that this situation should be allowed to exist he said theyre trying to blame my son and hes totally innocentjacqueline price a spokeswoman for the district said last week that the school bus had not been displaying flashing lights to warn drivers of children disembarking because all six of the children who get off at that stop live on the same side of the streetbut parents of four of those children said thursday that they live across the streetstate law requires school buses to display flashing lights to stop traffic in both directions when children are unloading from the school bus to cross a highwayprice acknowledged thursday that four students do live on the other side of the street but because the bus normally has pulled away by the time they cross the driver is not required by law to flash his warning lights she saidwhat we dont know at this point is just what happened and why price said were still talking to students and parents and trying to get a sense of what happenedprice acknowledged that there were several major discrepancies in the districts initial account of the accident we werent intentionally inaccurate she said but we had limited information at the timebarbara lanni  said her family moved to orange county from new york only a week before the accident she enrolled her son at marian bergeson elementary school last tuesday and brought him to and from the school on wednesday his first day of classeshe had a wonderful day she recalled when she offered to accompany him into the classroom he replied no mommy ill go in myselfat the schools encouragement she signed up for the bus and waited with him thursday morning at the stop in front of her developmenti physically got on the bus with tommy so he would feel ok and introduced him to the other kids she said i told the bus driver that i was his mother i specifically told him that my son was new and that he did not know the area at all that he was completely unfamiliar with the area he said dont worry ill take care of him i trusted himschool officials confirmed the substance of barbara lannis conversation with the driver whom district officials have declined to identify he could not be reached for commentat  pm lanni said she was waiting at the stop for her son but the bus never arrived at ambassador place and aliso niguelbut one stop earlier at el pilar and aliso niguel thomas lanni speculated his son may have become confused as the bus passed a nearby shopping centerhe knew he was close to home lanni said he was just unsurelanni was the first child off the bus and was hit when a pickup truck pulled around the busat the top of the hill barbara lanni said she waited and waited for her soni didnt know what happened she said but i had a bad feeling    i was at a loss as to where my little boy was going to beafter driving down the hill to the accident scene she said i ran up to the bus and i looked around and tommy wasnt on the busi wished to god he was i ran up to one of the officers and asked him if they had seen a little boy in a yellow shirt but he didnt want to look at meafter the accident price said that thomas had darted into traffic to greet friends across the streetbut parents and children at the stop said the boy did not run into the street to greet friends he had just moved to the area and knew no one and in any case witnesses said there were no children across the street at the time of the accidentprice said the districts earlier statement was probably conjecture    we dont know why he ran across the streetspeed limit signs along aliso niguel road also are a source of controversyresidents of the area said they have been demanding speed
