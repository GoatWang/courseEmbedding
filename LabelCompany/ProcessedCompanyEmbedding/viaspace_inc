energy of all fossil fuels and coalfired power plants are a major source of manmade carbon dioxide emissions coalfired power plants generally have a life of  to  years and represent a huge global capital investment it is not economically feasible to retire these coalfired power plants and replace them with greener technology it is possible however to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by replacing some of the coal with biomass  burning both fuels together which is called cofiring several european countries and japan and korea have mandated carbon dioxide emissions reductions from their power plants and have provided incentives subsidies and feed in tariffs that make cofiring of biomass with coal financially feasible biomass pellets are considerably more expensive than coal and would not be an attractive option on price alone an older and larger market for pellets is for residential and business heating in winter some countries have district heating where the heat is generated in a central location and distributed in the form of hot water or steam combined heat and power chp systems generate both heat and electricity there are also residential heating systems designed for pellets and these can be domestic boilers that generate hot water or simple pellet stoves the vast majority of pellets produced and consumed in the world are made from wood global wood pellet consumption about  of the pellets are used for heating and  for industrial uses mostly electricity generation for comparison  the worldwide coal production was about  million metric tons  times larger than the global biomass pellet reduction europe is the largest producer of biomass pellets and also the largest consumer the demand for pellets in europe is larger than supply and europe is the largest importer of pellets the united states is the second largest producer of pellets and canada is third to assure a supply of biomass for their power plants several european utilities have set up pellet mills in the us near the source of sawdust and other waste wood japan and korea are importing wood pellets and china is both producing and using pellets giant king grass pellets giant king grass has been made into pellets which have been tested by several independent laboratories pictures of giant king grass pellets and a typical analysis are shown below giant king grass pellets have the same size and shape as wood pellets analysis of giant king grass pellets by biomass energy lab note that a local giant king grass power plant does not need to make pellets chopped and dried giant king grass can be used directly which avoids the cost of making pellets pellets are only needed if the biomass must be shipped over long distances biocoal the use of biomass pellets is well established but has some limitations traditional biomass pellets have lower energy density per ton compared to coal and they cannot be stored outdoors in the rain because they absorb moisture and disintegrate new processes including torrefaction and hydrothermal catalysis convert biomass into biocoal which is pelletized and has properties very similar to ordinary coal it has the same energy density and can be stored outdoors biocoal can be mixed in any proportion with coal and pulverized in the same machines biocoal burns cleanly and does produce the mercury or sulfur emissions of coal giant king grass has been converted into biocoal and has the same energy density as good metallurgical quality coal privacy policy  terms of use    viaspace all rights reserved viaspace  contact us

viaspace to produce giant king grass in pellet form to replace coal for power plants in us  europe supports us environmental protection agency proposal european efforts to control carbon dioxide and other emissions blamed for global warming press release source viaspace inc on monday october   irvine calif oct  prnewswirefirstcall  viaspace inc otc bulletin board vspc  news a clean energy company growing giant king grass as a renewable high yield biomass energy crop today announced plans to produce pellets made from giant king grass as an alternative to coal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coalfired power plants across the us and europe according to the us department of energy pellets made from giant king grass and other biomass can potentially replace up to  of the coal in an existing coalfired power plant giant king grass and other plants absorb carbon dioxide during their growth when the grass is burned it emits carbon dioxide but the next crop of grass  days later absorbs the carbon dioxide and the overall process can be nearly carbon neutral and therefore reduces the carbon dioxide emissions of the power plant significantly many existing coalfired power plants can be adapted at modest cost to replace part of the coal with biomass pellets in a process called cofiring in a single megawatt coalfired power plant replacing  of the coal with giant king grass pellets would require approximately  million tons of pellets per year and yield revenue of approximately  million at todays prices for biomass pellets as reported by the associated press on sept   the environmental protection agency epa announced a proposal to reduce emissionsprimarily carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuelsfrom hundreds of electric power plants and other large factories and refineries in the us according to the epa these large sources are responsible for  of the greenhouse gas emissions that are released each year by using the power and authority of the clean air act we can begin reducing emissions from the nations largest greenhousegas emitting facilities without placing an undue burden on the businesses that make up the vast majority of our economy epa administrator lisa jackson said viaspace chief executive dr carl kukkonen commented cofiring with biomass pellets is probably the simplest and least expensive way to reduce the carbon emissions from coalfired power plants because it can be accomplished by modifying existing coal plants and not replacing them alternatives such as carbon dioxide capture from the smokestack and storage underground are considered much more expensive and not expected to occur for many years as a result cofiring with biomass pellets is now being implemented in europe as discussed in prior announcements independent analysis of giant king grass has shown it to have excellent energy content and confirmed its suitability for burning in electric power plants kukkonen continued with this in mind viaspace has produced a prototype of the pellets for evaluation worldwide  of electricity is generated from coal which produces the greatest carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy of any fossil fuel kukkonen added replacing just  of coal worldwide would require approximately two billion tons of giant king grass pellets per year which represents a market potential of more than  billion a year with a highyield crop like giant king grass to grow the amount of grass would require only modest additional acreage equal to  of current world cropland giant king grass can be cultivated on marginal land where it would not compete with food crops in addition to cofiring  dedicated biomass power plants are being built throughout the world and coalfired power plants are being converted to run on much larger amounts of biomass according to a global climate law posting on sept   at globalclimatelawcom company officials at ohio edison an electric utility serving customers in central and northeastern ohio say that one of its coalfiring plantsto be retrofitted for up to  biomass to be cofired with a maximum of  coalis expected to reduce yearly emissions of carbon dioxide by  million tons to  tons most of which should be offset by the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the biomass crops during their growth the cost of converting the facility to biomass was expected to be materially lower than installing scrubbers or reconfiguring for natural gas updated pictures of giant king grass are available on viaspaces website at wwwviaspacecom about viaspace inc viaspace is an alternative energy

recent corporate developments and strategic direction dr schewe stated on september   i entered into a loan agreement with viaspace to provide up to  in convertible loans to the company over a fiveyear time frame on january   that loan agreement was completed with a cumulative  loaned to viaspace and converted to common shares over a  year and  month time frame i have purposely converted that entire loan amount to common shares in an effort to keep debt off our books including the  million common shares that i had previously purchased on the open market i now preferentially hold nearly  million common shares or roughly  of the  billion outstanding shares i have not sold a single share of vspc common stock and have no nearterm plans to sell shares my shares are not trading and

convertible loan agreement provides up to an additional  through the end of january  this money will be used for working capital related to general operations and also including the ongoing commercialization of the giant king grass gkg business in addition to assisting the company with its capital needs i have been a handson active board chairman working directly with the management team and i am always available to them since becoming chairman i have personally traveled to meet with clientsbusiness partners reviewed various contractsagreements supported our management team and i have reviewed andor edited every viaspace press release dr schewe continued we have come a long way these past three years in a business space where many companies have failed the biomass and bioenergy business has incredible scientific merit to reduce greenhouse emissions and evolve into a spearhead to reduce the forces of global warming despite the current phenomenon of low global oil prices and oil oversupply the truth is that burning oil and fossil fuels at any price adds to co emissions and global warming it is our desire to be part of the global warming solution making this work economically is a challenge that we are addressing and plan to accomplish in late december  our ceo mr haris basit and our cto dr carl kukkonen both came to denver and we met to review and establish our strategy for  we have divided our business strategy into two lines of business namely bioenergy and animal feed our energia reino verde erv mw giant king grass fueled power plant project in nicaragua has required much of our efforts and resources the past  years we have learned a lot along with our nicaraguan partners to make this amazing project a reality we know that baseload power is important as opposed to intermittent solar or wind power that all electricity is not priced equally  that baseload power may cost more than intermittent power and that with private developers the financial partners need to make an adequate return on investment this project is ready to go and is awaiting final government approval we are not static and waiting but actively seeking the final government approval our nicaraguan partners have excellent working relationships with the government in nicaragua one of our corporate strategies to address the economic challenges of this business space is to couple animal feed business activities with biomass and bioelectricity business in other words we can create cash flow using gkg animal feed while establishing a gkg plantation for biomassbioelectricity purposes we are working with our nicaraguan partners to advance this concept and believe that our overall project in nicaragua will be an attractive global business model that can be replicated anywhere that gkg can be successfully cultivated we are partnered with almaden energy group aeg and we are growing gkg for animal feed in californias central valley and imperial valley we are moving into the animal feed business ourselves so that we are the experts and selfreliant but can also effectively partner with others as the middleman we are rapidly developing significant supportive data and proprietary processes related to our budding animal feed business dr schewe concluded last year we had two longterm shareholders who were qualified investors make significant investments in viaspace and directly purchase discounted restricted vspc shares from the company any qualified investor potentially wanting to make a significant direct investment in viaspace can inquire and do the same we are on the cusp of success and that is why i have committed to another significant loan to viaspace we have active projects and new projects both bioenergy and animal feed underway on multiple continents every week we receive multiple inquiries from parties interested in biomass bioenergy and animal feed projects we have been working with a lobbying firm in washington dc since august  to try and participate in governmentfunded grants and develop governmentsponsored partnerships a successful entrepreneur mr haris basit became our ceo in july  and he and i together know that new revenue creation is our number one priority and job number one we will continue to work hard to grow the value of this company and make this company a green energy and animal

inc vspc reported that ceo mr haris basit visited the energia reino verde giant king grass power plant project under development in nicaragua in december  chief technology officer dr carl kukkonen accompanied him during the visit   energia reino verde erv is a planned  mw biomass power plant colocated with a  acre giant king grass plantation that is part of a larger  acre rice plantation and rice mill that provides rice to agricorp a large diversified food company that has more than  of the rice market in nicaragua viaspace is codeveloping this project with agricorp executives and investors viaspace and the agricorp team are equal partners in erv the project has received a letter of intent from two international development banks which are working together to provide the debt financing and the nicaraguan partners will arrange the majority of the equity financing the boiler technology has been selected and an engineering procurement and construction contract has been signed giant king grass has been growing in nicaragua for more than two years the project is ready to go upon approval of the nicaraguan government mr basit met with mr amilcar ybarra ceo of agricorp in managua to receive a briefing on the erv project and visited the rice plantation where the giant king grass is growing and met with the agriculture team mr basit stated i was very impressed with the overall capabilities of agricorp and we are pleased to have them as a partner i want to thank mr ybarra for hosting my visit it is clear that the project is very far along and that we will be able to proceed very quickly once we get government approval  the visit to the rice plantation was very informative  they plant and harvest about  acres of rice twice each year they are extremely professional with topquality equipment and trained agronomists it is a large operation that includes an onsite rice mill giant king grass has been growing on the plantation for more than two years and the power plant will also be colocated on the plantation so that the furthest field will only be  miles from the power plant this makes logistics much simpler and financially efficient the giant king grass project in nicaragua will provide reliable  base electricity that is renewable with zero net carbon dioxide emissions the project will replace imported oil which is the source of base electricity today and provide more than  rural jobs in nicaragua other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are intermittent sources that cannot be relied upon continuously and require oil backup electricity to compensate for intermittency  mr basit concluded the energia reino verde project will be our showroom for customers for future projects throughout the world viaspace has the capability to develop the entire project including the plantation and power plant and is working with customers and development partners on similar projects around the globe we and our partners can do everything from a prefeasibility study and financial model through engineering procurement and construction and commissioning of the power plant   ♦ december    viaspace update on giant king grass electricity projects httpwwwotcmarketscomstockvspcnews   walnut calif dec   prnewswire  viaspace inc vspc provides an update on electricity projects being pursued by viaspace and partners around the world several of the projects have been publicly discussed previously and some are new projects all of the projects have customer sensitivity and some are completely confidential at the request of the customers the confidential projects will only be described at a high level   biomass electricity projects using giant king grass as the fuel have many unique and favorable characteristics renewable energy  giant king grass is a highyield perennial crop that regrows after cutting and is harvested  to  times per year for energy provides  hourperday reliable base electricity throughout the year other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are intermittent sources that cannot be relied upon continuously does not require oil backup electricity to compensate for intermittency carbon neutral  direct combustion of giant king grass or burning biogas releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere plants breathe carbon dioxide and the regrowth of the giant king grass reabsorbs the same amount of carbon dioxide that was emitted money stays in the country in most cases giant king grass replaces imported oil or coal growing in country means that the money stays in the country rather than going overseas to pay for oil creates jobs  the giant king grass plantation creates needed rural agricultural employment in addition to employment at the power plant these are important factors for all of our customers a major negative factor for renewable energy over this recent year has been low oil prices many developing countries depend on oil for their electricity in mid giant king grass electricity was at a much lower price than oil electricity today oil electricity is less expensive than biomass solar and wind electricity producers recognize that oil is not likely to stay at a low price for the  year life of a power plant but they are profiting from the low oil prices while they last the recent climate conference in paris has brought new emphasis on clean renewable energy and this is very encouraging current giant king grass power plant projects fall into two types  one method is direct combustion which produces heat that boils water to make highpressure steam which turns a turbine connected to a generator which makes electricity the other method is anaerobic digestion which uses a biological process to convert giant king grass into a methane rich biogas which is burned in an engine that turns a generator to make electricity direct combustion projects range from  mw to  mw and even higher typical anaerobic digestion projects are from  mw to  mw direct combustion power plant projects energia reino verde in nicaragua is a  mw project colocated with a  acre giant king grass plantation that is part of a larger  acre rice plantation  viaspace is codeveloping this project with prominent nicaraguan partners the project has received a letter of intent from two international development banks which are working together to provide for  debt financing and the nicaraguan partners will arrange the majority of the equity financing the boiler technology has been selected and an engineering procurement and construction epc contract has been signed giant king grass has been growing in nicaragua for more than two years the project is ready to go and is awaiting approval from the nicaraguan government viaspace was retained by a customer to conduct a prefeasibility study to essentially reproduce the nicaragua project in africa the prefeasibility study was completed and the customer has indicated that they plan to pursue the project viaspace will provide the giant king grass and training for their  acre plantation another customer has contracted for a formal feasibility study for a  mw giant king grass power plant and  acre giant king grass plantation a draft feasibility study has been delivered to the customer and the final product will be delivered in january  this project is in the americas viaspace is at an earlier stage in providing information for potential projects in asia and africa biogas power plant projects tibbar energy usvi llc is developing an anaerobic digestion ad renewable energy facility that will produce a net of mw of base load power that will be sold to virgin island water and power authority wapa for the next  years on the island of st croix the project will provide almost  of the islands base load power tania tomyn the ceo of tibbar energy said we have just about finished a month full scale pilot giving us our biogas yields and fertilizer management design the ad facility will produce its own fertilizer for the farm land tibbar will grow gkg on and provide small farmers on the island of st croix with fertilizer for free  tibbar has been growing giant king grass on st croix for three years  the project has a fully executed power purchase agreement and approval from the virgin island public service commission psc  local and federal permits approved and the project is in final stages of financial close which is anticipated in early  the carbon neutral project will be a testament to gkg crop production and baseload power production in the caribbean clean energy solutions pacific is developing a  mw anaerobic digestion power plant in papua new guinea giant king grass will be the exclusive fuel the company has contracted with viaspace for a design and engineering study and operations plan of the power plant these have been completed the company has a power purchase agreement and is in discussions on the financing of the power plant viaspace is pursuing other biogas opportunities in the americas and elsewhere viaspace chief technology officer dr carl kukkonen reports there are many opportunities for giant king grass as a fuel for power plants and as a feedstock for biofuels and biochemicals the highyield of giant king grass combined with the logistical and cost advantages of colocation of the power plant and plantation and continuous justintime harvesting make giant king grass the least expensive biomass energy crop giant king grass can also be cofired with seasonal agricultural waste such as rice straw or sugarcane bagasse viaspace has the ability to deliver an entire biomass power plant solution including the giant king grass plantation and the power plant itself which is available from our wellknown partners  the recent climate conference in paris should make zero carbon biomass electricity more attractive giant king grass can also be used to make pellets and bio coal for cofiring with coal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions viaspace chairman dr kevin schewe commented zero carbon biomass energy projects have been facing economic headwinds given the recent low cost of oil we know that oil prices fluctuate and will eventually go up again on december    countries agreed by consensus to a global climate pact the paris agreement to reduce emissions as part of the method for reducing greenhouse gas in the page document the members agreed to reduce their carbon output as soon as possible and to do their best to keep global warming to well below  degrees celsius frances foreign minister laurent fabius said this ambitious and balanced plan was a historic turning point in the goal of reducing global warming we are hopeful that this renewed international emphasis on global warming and reduction of co levels will translate into bonafide economic stimulus or carbon credits that will accelerate the attractiveness of our business model for biomass derived electricity we are making every effort to finalize the projects in our immediate pipeline which will serve as excellent carbon neutral examples for the global community about viaspace inc viaspace grows renewable giant king® grass as a lowcarbon fuel for clean

httpwwwotcmarketscomstockvspcnews walnut calif nov   prnewswire  viaspace inc vspc has been working intensively on growing giant king® grass gkg in california at the viaspace nursery the university of california desert research and extension center and with our partner almaden energy group llc aeg for the past six months this press release outlines the progress so far in this effort   a detailed analysis of gkg for animal feed has been conducted using gkg grown at the viaspace nursery and independently at university of california research farm in holtville ca  this study done in concert with professional agronomists and animal nutritionists helped determine the optimum time to harvest so as to maximize yield and feed value and thus revenue the study included analysis of dozens of samples taken at various maturities for the yield as well as for the concentration of over thirty different nutrients and minerals  peak nutritional value and yield versus maturity were determined in addition to the nutrition studies gkg at uc holtville was mechanically harvested using a conventional swather dried in the field and then baled into hay some gkg bales were sent to a local dairy for feed trials and some were used to produce animal feed pellets using a commercial pellet company the pellets were analyzed for nutritional content and palatability animal feed can be used in the form of fresh chopped gkg silage hay or pellets  samples of gkg from multiple harvests in  have been provided to local farmers and successfully fed to cows goats and pigs  the nutrition analysis shows that gkg is also suitable for horses aeg has leased a twentysix acre plot of land in imperial county ca and also engaged a professional grower to grow giant king grass  twenty acres were planted in august  utilizing several different techniques and planting densities  both manual and automated planting techniques were utilized  careful measurement of the cost and effectiveness of each technique has been performed  this is a necessary step prior to scaling gkg for large production acreage  additional planting techniques have been tested in october and more will be tested in spring of   testing to determine optimum harvesting and baling techniques will be carried out in the first half of  furthermore these  acres have been outfitted with equipment to accurately measure water utilization and confirm the water efficiency of gkg on a larger scale a second smaller plot of land has been planted in californias central valley in the heart of the largest and most concentrated dairy region within the united states  dairies are particularly sensitive to the nutritional content of their feed and usually benefit the most from quality feed with high protein content  the purpose of this plot is to determine if gkg can be cost effectively grown this far north in a climate that is significantly cooler than imperial county  we are working closely with a major dairy and their professional nutritionists to establish the value of gkg within the dairy industry  if gkg can be cost effectively grown in this region it may be able to replace crops that consume far greater amounts of water than gkg thus alleviating a crucial water shortage in that region viaspace chief executive officer haris basit stated viaspace is excited about the potential for using gkg as animal feed  early tests indicate that gkg provides high quality animal nutrition using less acreage and water than existing forage crops this potentially addresses the most important problems facing agriculture in california today we have gotten excellent cooperation from major dairies and are hopeful that animal feed will open up a new major market for us viaspace board chairman dr kevin schewe commented we have strategically divided our business into two lines animal feed and bioenergy we believe that animal feed will represent an expedient and economically viable pathway to drive our business forward viaspace and aeg are investing the necessary effort and resources to insure that we are responsible for our own success in commercializing gkg for animal feed i am very pleased with the entrepreneurship and business enterprise skills that mr basit has brought to viaspace we mutually understand and agree on the importance and priority to get more significant revenues moving through this company viaspace will be providing an update on energy related projects separately in the coming weeks aeg is focused on commercializing gkg for animal feed within the continental united states
