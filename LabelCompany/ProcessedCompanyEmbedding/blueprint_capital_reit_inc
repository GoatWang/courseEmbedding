veterans mark knoll and dan duffus to help local builders develop and finance smallscale residential housing the simple idea was to create a better lending model—along with a technology platform and trusted brand—to serve the seattle market the first and obvious part of our thesis was clear that community banks have significant challenges lending to smallscale builders due in large part to new constraints under doddfrank legislation and stricter fdic regulations—a trend that is likely to continue the second part of our thesis was that helping local builders with more than just financing would produce better results for them as well as our investors  this new “valueadded” approach applied to the entire project lifecycle is the differentiating feature of blueprint building on our early success we converted the company to a real estate investment trust reit in  to facilitate loan growth and develop rental property for our portfolio today we are proud to have become seattle’s leading reit with the lowest loan default rate zero among our peer banking competitors our market seattle is one of the most active real estate markets in the country it provides key requirements for housing demand such as strong population job and income growth within the seattle market we focus on urban “infill” development rather than suburban “tract” development urban housing is in high demand and more resilient to market cycles and recycling land in established neighborhoods reduces suburban sprawl—a much more environmentallysustainable solution to growth urban “infill” development urban

phases of the project lifecycle  blueprint sources projects through our agent referral network provides competitive financing completes the plans and permits and helps market the project during construction this integrated cooperative approach increases builder productivity and in turn reduces risk for our shareholders our real estate holdings in addition to lending blueprint develops residential income property for its portfolio our relationship network produces many excellent opportunities for “build and hold” projects in the same urban infill neighborhoods that are close to transit shopping and entertainment currently we are focusing on studio apartment homes that are affordable for residents making  of the median area income key drivers for acquiring rental real estate are  income diversity capital appreciation and building a rental infrastructure in the event that we acquire and hold real estate through a loan foreclosure   our shareholders blueprint is owned by a
