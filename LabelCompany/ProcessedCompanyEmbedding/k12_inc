rise and the concept of online education has strong political support especially among republicans as well as enormous buzz ks aggressive student recruitment has led to dismal academic results by students and skyhigh dropout rates in some cases more than  annually and there have been so many regulatory issues and accusations of malfeasance that im convinced the problems are endemic the

perform significantly worse than brickandmortar schools in recent years there has been an explosion of virtual schools also called internet schools and cyber schools from  to   bills passed in  states and territories including the district of columbia that expand online schooling regulate virtual education or modify existing regulations according to a national conference of state legislatures ncsl database many of these bills are attributable to american legislative exchange council alec politicians as discussed below alec passed a model virtual schools act in  until recently data on performance was scarce but educators at the national education policy center did two of the first empirical studies in  and  on the effectiveness of fulltime online schools the authors concluded that despite the amount of taxpayer dollars going towards these schools there is very little solid evidence to justify the rapid expansion of virtual education one of the studies looking at state data on performance shows major problems with cyber schools the  report by nepc notes on the common metrics of adequate yearly progress ayp state performance rankings and graduation rates fulltime virtual schools lag significantly behind traditional brickandmortar schools in particular only  percent of k inc online schools met ayp in  compared to  percent of public schools and of the  k inc schools that were assigned a school rating by state education authorities only seven  percent of them had ratings that clearly indicated satisfactory status as of an nepc report published july  specifically on k incs operations the  nepc study also shows that ontime graduation rates are also much lower at online schools than at all public schools on average in the united states only  percent of students at virtual high schools graduate on time whereas the national average for all public high schools is  percent more than twice that other critics have wondered where some of the taxpayer dollars directed to online schools end up a study of the performance of pennsylvania online charter schools by the center for research on education outcomes credo at stanford university found that  percent of cyber charters performed significantly worse than their traditional public school counterparts in both reading and math” a tenmonth investigation of colorado virtual schools found that half of the students of online schools left within a year and that when they returned to brickandmortar schools they were often further behind academically than when they started the company has countered critics by citing data from multiple choice tests according to politico in  when the securities and exchange commission questioned k about its academic results earlier this year k again pointed to the scantron data as proof of its success yet those data are “not as accurate as they could be” k inc executive chairman nathaniel davis acknowledged in an interview with politico the scantron tests are optional and the company has been comparing a selfselected group of k inc students to the national norm which isn’t appropriate davis said walton family foundationfunded studies document terrible performance of online virtual charter schools  the walton family foundation a major charter school proponent concluded that online education must be reimagined in an article published in education weekly on january   the authors of the piece walton family foundation directors marc sternberg and marc holley explained the results of three independent studies they funded to investigate the performance of virtual charter schools one such study conducted by stanford universitys center for research on education outcomes credo revealed that over the course of a school year the students in virtual charters learned the equivalent of  fewer days in math and  fewer days in reading than their peers in traditional charter schools on average sternberg and holley go on to explain the implications of these findings saying if virtual charters were grouped together and ranked as a single school district it would be the ninthlargest in the country and among the worstperforming as a result sternberg and holley stated that they will be more cautious with their future online charter school donations and make sure recipients are confronting the problems exposed by the studies with poor results and declining enrollment k changes business model two days after the walton family foundation called for a revamping of the online charter education system k held its quarterly shareholder conference call in which executives discussed an ongoing shift in ks business model from running cyber public schools to selling curriculum and other platform services between september  and september  enrollment at managed virtual schools run by k was declining  percent while it was increasing  percent at nonmanaged schools which pay for ks content and platform but which are run by

made less progress as a group in reading math science and social studies than students enrolled in all  other elementary and middle schools who took the same tests the school fell far short of state expectations for the second year in a row despite these repeatedly poor results lobbying efforts by k inc ensured that the school would remain open for the  school year when governor bill haslams administration proposed a bill in january  that would let it limit enrollment or shut down a school that underperformed for two years k inc waged a public relations campaign that involved the schools teachers some of its parents and lobbyists according to the tennesseean the companys longtime lobbyist the powerful nashville firm of mcmahan winstead worked against the bill yielding an amendment stretching the time limit to three years but not satisfied k inc hired the ingram group the firm founded by haslams adviser tom ingram the lobbying did not succeed in further changes to the legislation however and governor haslam signed the bill in may  k inc school in colorado denied charter school authorization for subpar performance forced to pay back  to state in november  the colorado charter school institute ccsi an independent state agency that authorizes charter schools in the state denied k incs student colorado virtual academys application for charter school authorization in its decision ccsi cited concerns that the schools student performance was below the th percentile of schools statewide that it had a student turnover of  percent for elementary and middle school students and  percent for high school students that the schools board had not followed through on a rubric for holding k inc accountable and that its curriculum did not adequately

a consulting firm that prepares an annual review of policy and practice for online learning the bill was passed at the behest of republican governor mark schweikers administration according to the proeducation privatization reach foundation and he signed it into law june   an earlier  charter school law act  had allowed for the creation of some online charter schools although the law did not anticipate this according to ron cowell of the education policy and leadership center that law is very similar to the american legislative exchange councils  charter schools act according to the new york times in pennsylvania online schools bill each of their students home districts the full perpupil amount that the district would otherwise have spent to educate that child in a brickandmortar school which averages over  per student making pennsylvania one of the most lucrative states in the nation in which to operate forprofit online schools and harming public schools but a study of the

principal of eachieve told the paper that his school is glad to be free of the company its been our experience that the interest of their shareholders is the most critical deciding factor when decisions are being made they may say they have the best interests of students in mind and im sure their teachers care about their students just as much as our teachers care about students but the people making decisions do have to answer to shareholders and i think thats a conflict of interests other controversies k settles lawsuit with california department of justice for  million dollars k inc settled a lawsuit with the bureau of children’s justice and false claims unit of the california department of justice for  million the lawsuit filed by the attorney general’s office alleged that k and the california virtual academies cava schools it manages were publishing misleading information intended to convince parents to enroll their kids in k schools submitting “inflated student attendance numbers and influencing “nonprofit online charter schools to enter into unfavorable contracts that put them deep in a financial hole the attorney generals office also alleged that k and the cava schools received “more dollars in state funding from the california department of education than they were entitled to according to california department of justice k is required to “provide approximately  million in debt relief to the nonprofit schools it manages” and pay  million in settlement claims they are also required to reform their contacts with the  cava schools be subjected to an independent review over their services for students with disabilities “ensure the accuracy of all advertisements provide teachers with sufficient information and training to prevent improper claiming of attendance dollars and change policies and practices to prevent the kinds of conduct that led to this investigation and agreement drop out rate extremely high but school funding formulas continue to pay for students for extended periods k inc ceo ronald packard repeatedly describes growing student enrollments as the companys manifest destiny this manifest destiny is producing an extremely high drop out rate also called a churn rate anecdotal reports and studies put the churn rate at some k schools as high as  luis huerta a columbia university education specialist calculated a churn rate for ks agora cyber charter school at  percent at ohio virtual academy another k inc school the churn rate in  was almost  percent according to newsworks a state audit of k incs colorado virtual academy found that the state paid for students who were not attending the school and k inc was ordered to return  see the audit report here despite much lower operating costs “the online companies collect nearly as much taxpayer money in some states as brickandmortar charter schools in pennsylvania about  students are enrolled in online schools at an average cost of about  per student the state auditor general jack wagner said that is double or more what it costs the companies to educate those children online” reports the new york times “it’s extremely unfair for the taxpayer to be paying for additional expenses such as advertising” mr wagner told the times and some of the money is also spent on lobbying in  after student proficiency dropped at nine out of the  cyber charters in pennsylvania wagner announced that taxpayers overpay the state’s cyber charters by about  million a year and recommended changes to the school funding formula to protect taxpayers reports politico the funding formula in many states works like this explains education experts the kids enroll you get the money the kids disappear gary miron of western michigan university told the new york times class action lawsuit by investors against k inc for false statements re student performance and deceptive recruiting practices the problems with the k inc model were highlighted by the details revealed in a shareholder lawsuit in january  a k inc shareholder sued k inc for securities fraud in federal court alleging that the firm made false statements to investors about students performance on standardized tests and boosted its enrollment and revenues through deceptive recruiting in june  the class of shareholders filed an amended complaint which includes information from interviews with former k teachers and staff which can be accessed here the class action lawsuit was filed after a series of news reports in particular a new york times article of december   and an associated press article of december   found a mismatch between k inc student achievement and statements made by ceo ron packard after the articles were published k inc stock dropped  percent the plaintiffs alleged that the company misled shareholders by overstating its academic performance and by not providing accurate information about studenttoteacher ratios and how students are recruited according to education week shareholders claimed that the company did not disclose the churn rates during conference calls with stockholders or in the documents it filed as a result the plaintiffs contended the price at which k incs stock was traded was artificially inflated k inc reached a tentative settlement agreement in march  in which it agreed to pay  million to plaintiffs who brought the suit while company officials continue to deny any claims of wrongdoing lawsuit alleges k misled investors ceo profited another lawsuit filed in april  claimed that k misled investors by making wildly positive statements about the company and its future only to reveal it was actually financially offtarget and that ceo ron packard reaped  million by selling off his own stock before the negative announcement ncaa says k courses dont count for studentathletes in april  the ncaa issued a document announcing that coursework completed at  kaffiliated schools would not count for studentathletes eligibility ks schools had been placed under extended evaluation in  the ncaa did not provide an explanation of their decision when contacted by media former staff allege fraudulent tactics to mask astronomical rates of student turnover much was learned about the business practices of k inc from the  classaction investor lawsuit described above dozens of former employees claimed that the company used dubious and sometimes fraudulent tactics to mask astronomical rates of student turnover in its national network of cyber charter schools according to the huffington post at the beginning of the  school year k incs agora cyber charter school enrolled  students by the end of that year the schools enrollment had increased to  but almost  students withdrew from agora during the school year at ohio virtual academy another k inc school the churn rate in  was almost  percent according to newsworks according to these former employees the churn rate at the companys cyber schools was part of a selfperpetuating cycle to increase revenues the suit alleges the company aggressively recruited as many students as possible including some who were not properly prepared for k incs fulltime online schooling when students struggled they claim company officials told teachers to keep the students on the schools rolls by manipulating attendance data and inflating students grades according to newsworks these claims were listed by anonymous confidential witnesses in court documents many of the allegations come from people who worked for pennsylvanias agora cyber charter school which enrolls roughly a quarter of the  pennsylvania students that have opted for online schools in one example a former agora teacher said that the school continued to bill the home school district of one special education student who was absent for  consecutive days even though pennsylvania requires that cyber charter students who miss  straight days be reported as withdrawn the teacher stated what agora does is keep the kid in inactive limbo and keep billing former employees also described the companys highpressure approach to student recruitment involving call centers with enrollment consultants who received commissions and perks for hitting enrollment quotas  of parents who enrolled their children in the schools they also alleged that k incs recruitment aggressively targeted innercity and atrisk populations even though a senior company official admitted that the k curriculum wasnt built for innercity kids why according to the lawsuit k incs motive was higher potential profit the hardtoserve students were more likely to be chronically truant and would thus use fewer of the companys resources according to newsworks in their lawsuit k inc investors claimed that the company did not disclose the churn rates during conference calls with stockholders or in the documents it filed as a result the plaintiffs contended the price at which k incs stock was traded was artificially inflated spending taxpayer dollars on advertising to pump up attendance numbers and taxpayer subsidies a  article in usa today revealed that virtual forprofit k schools have spent millions in taxpayer dollars on advertising   million from  to  k inc itself the paper found spent about  million in just the first eight months of  a company spokesperson declined to say what percentage of ks perpupil expenses goes to advertising but a university of colorado professor estimated that k inc was on pace by november to spend about  per student on advertising or about  percent of its perpupil public expenditures in  usa today also noted where the advertising dollars were focused in  k inc spent an estimated  to advertise on nickelodeon  on the cartoon network and  on meetmecom a social networking site popular with teens it also dropped  on vampirefreakscom which calls itself the webs largest community for dark alternative culture jim buckheit executive director of the pennsylvania association of school administrators told the new york times some of the cyber charter schools have fairly aggressive recruitment campaigns    they have vans billboards tv and radio ads they set up recruitment meetings in area hotels and invite parents to come the massive advertising pulls in parents students and state money but students often do not stay in the cyber school and one study indicates that churn of students could be more than  percent in some schools allegations of uncertified teachers in florida in january  floridas department of education launched an investigation of k inc over allegations that the company was using uncertified teachers and had asked employees to cover up the practice according to npr in  k inc asked seminole county public schools if it could employ uncertified teachers  each overseen by a teacher of record a certified teacher  to teach some of its online classes the district denied the request after consulting with the florida department of education and citing state laws but a former k inc employee forwarded a series of emails to school district officials showing that the company was attempting to claim that certified teachers had taught students they might not even have encountered even after education officials warned the company that this was not permissible according to the florida center for investigative reporting in a feb   email k incs samantha gilormini who was in charge of the companys florida schools asked teachers to sign class rosters that included students they had not taught the reason k inc needed to use their certification to comply with florida law on classes for which they didnt have teachers with the required subject certifications    one teacher amy capelle was given a roster of  students shed only taught seven of those students and refused to sign after learning of this seminole county school officials called for a state investigation in  the florida department of education released its preliminary report in april  in which the inspector general found that k inc had assigned teachers working with one district to classes outside their certified fields and provided records of educators teaching students with whom they had no interaction according to education week seminole county officials had also accused k inc of using teachers who were not certified in the state of florida but the office of inspector general said it did not find evidence to back up that allegation questionable relationship with nonprofit charter holders   another issue raising red flag is k inc’s  relationship with nonprofit charter holders  most states will only grant charters to nonprofit  c  tax exempt entities which k inc is not so the firm generally signs a longterm contract with a nonprofit to run the school news reports indicate that the relationship is often problematic under state law    a recent example comes from new jersey from the newark starledger   a contract obtained by the starledger shows the publicly traded company — which operates charter schools for thousands of students in  states and made  million in the last school year — selected newark prep’s principal drafted its budget and leased it furniture and equipment in return newark prep paid the company nearly half a million dollars or  percent of the  million it received last school year to educate students according to financial data provided by the school’s board of trustees this year as the student body grows the fees could take up to  percent of the school’s revenue according to the contract new jersey law allows forprofit companies to play a big role in public schools one thing they can’t do is run the place wall street investor whitney tilson who is betting k inc will fail puts it bluntly “many of these nonprofits are a sham for all intents and purposes k controls and operates and profits from nonprofit charter schools in blatant violation of most state law and irs regulation” teaching quality the quality of teaching is also an important issue in addition to allegations of uncertified teachers in some states and very high studentteacher ratios online students generally have little interaction with their teachers as politico reports students can email or call teachers for help or log in to online lectures but there’s little personal interaction many assignments meant to check for understanding are multiple choice there’s no way to stop kids from looking up the answers online and the cyber schools which get additional funds for each student enrolled have incentives to keep families happy which some teachers say leads to pressure to award passing grades regardless of effort k inc the largest cyber school management company explicitly encourages teachers to forgive strings of zeros on homework and quizzes if the student can later show he’s learned the concepts otherwise kids who fail to do any work for weeks might get discouraged and drop out said allison cleveland an executive vice president at k we shouldn’t create an environment for students that they can’t overcome she said in many instances motivated parents are clearly the primary teacher raising the question if taxpayers are subsidizing homeschooling failure to comply with federal special education standards in november  the georgia department of education issued a report finding that k incs georgia cyber academy has repeatedly failed to comply with the federal individuals with disabilities education act and has violated student civil rights by failing to provide services required by the law georgia cyber academy has  special needs students the department of education threatened to close the online school if issues relating to special education were not addressed astroturf support for virtual education while there are some children and parents committed to the online model for a variety of reasons in some areas the support for the model appears manufactured the new york times reports that parent groups are popping up around the country funded and backed by online firms and rallies and protests are being sponsored that seem far from genuine in ohio former state representative stephen dyer became suspicious when members of the benignly named organization my school my choice paraded through his northeastern ohio district carrying signs attacking him “why won’t rep stephen dyer let parents choose the best education for their kids” the group describes itself as a coalition of parents teachers and employees of the schools but mr dyer said that his wife questioned the people carrying the signs and found out they were paid temp agency workers further digging by the times revealed that the groups incorporation documents named one of the group’s founders as tim dirrim a huntington national bank employee who serves as board president of the ohio virtual academy which is managed by k and receives more than  million a year from the state ties to the american legislative exchange council k inc cofounder william bennett has alec ties going back at least to  when he was listed as alecs key issue contact in the department of education since then bennett has been a guest

a private forprofit education model were introduced in  states and the district of columbia in the first half of  and  became law according to alec at  turning back the clock on prosperity and progress an august  report by the center for media and democracy cmd as a  report by the national education policy center notes alecs model legislation invariably promotes privatization for example soon after passage of tennessees law making private virtual school operators eligible to receive public funds k inc received a contract allowing it to provide virtual education to any tennessee student in grades k virtual public schools act alec and k inc work together to cash in on kids k inc together with another forprofit provider of online education connections academy was heavily involved in alecs model bill the virtual public schools act which makes online schools recognized public schools meaning they must be given the same resources and funding as other public schools in that state as noted by prwatch the alec bill provides that virtual schools should be paid the same per pupil rate as public schools that actually provide bricks and mortar public schools with desks heating and ac lunch ladies playgrounds gyms inperson teachers and extracurricular activities like sports orchestra and student councils in  when the model bill was drafted and approved both k inc and connections academy were part of the school choice subcommittee of alecs education task force according to an archived version of alecs website from february  the subcommittee recommended six bills for adoption including the virtual public schools act according to alec the bill was drafted by bryan flood of k along with mickey revenaugh of connections academy thencolorado representative don lee now a lobbyist for k see above and the rest of the subcommittee the bill was approved at a closeddoor meeting of the alec education task force in december  and became model legislation in january  when ratified by alecs board of directors the virtual public schools act is still moving in  between january and august  state bills similar to alecs model were introduced in arizona and maine and passed in michigan hb  according to cmds report on alec bills in  previous to  the bill was introduced in at least mississippi maine tennessee massachusetts virginia and texas according to a september  report by in the public interest itpi the bill paved the way for corporations to offer virtual online classes to public school students in many of these states legislators that sponsored this legislation were members of alec according to itpi which describes itself as a comprehensive resource center on privatization and responsible contracting the legislation offers enormous opportunities for the corporations who helped write it with the help of alec in the states that have passed the model bill these companies have strong operations k inc runs virtual public schools in tennessee texas and virginia as of  k inc has also been running ads heavily in wisconsin since changes signed into law by controversial governor scott walker after the law was implemented in tennessee in  as noted by bill moyers in his documentary the united states of alec k inc won a nobid contract from the union county school district which became the home of the new tennessee virtual academy the act states that students in grades kindergarten through twelve k who were enrolled in and attended a public school during the previous school year shall be eligible to participate in a virtual public education program now tennessee parents can pull their children out of their local school system and enroll them in union through the academy as of  there were about  students in the virtual school which is just about the same number of people who reside in maynardville the union county seat the district gets a small cut of the  in state aid that attaches to each student while k inc gets the rest according to the new york times but the virtual school has performed worse than any other school in the state for more see tennessee k online school performs worst in state but gets reprieve above ties to jeb bushs foundation for excellence in education k inc has been a funder of the foundation for excellence in education fee a nonprofit education reform advocacy group founded by former florida governor jeb bush according to emails released by the nonprofit privatization resource organization in the public interest fee is backed by many of the same forprofit school corporations that have funded alec and vote as equals with its legislators on templates to change laws governing americas public schools as noted by prwatch bushs group is also bankrolled by many of the same hardright foundations bent on privatizing public schools that have funded alec and they have pushed many of the same changes to the law which benefit their corporate benefactors and satisfy the free market fundamentalism of the billionaires whose taxdeductible charities underwrite the agenda of these two groups as in the public interest reports emails between fee and conservative state education officials in florida new mexico maine oklahoma rhode island and louisiana show that the foundation is writing state education laws and regulations in ways that could benefit its corporate funders the emails obtained through public records requests reveal that the organization sometimes working through its chiefs for change affiliate wrote and edited laws regulations and executive orders often in ways that improved profit opportunities for the organization’s financial backers bush has been referred to as the “godfather” of chiefs for change an alliance of conservative state superintendents and education department directors with significant authority over purchasing and policy in their states political activity k inc reported  in lobbying for education causes in  with the firm akin gump strauss hauer  feld k inc and its employees donated  to politicians of both parties ballot initiatives and political associations such as the republican governors association in  according to politico since  k inc and its employees have pumped almost  million into statelevel politics in  states as of  including contributions to candidates for office party committees and ballot initiatives in  k inc gave  to a group called families for better public schools to support a georgia ballot initiative to amend the state constitution so that an appointed statewide commission could authorize new schools the ballot measure passed with proponents like k inc americans for prosperity studentsfirst and the walton family foundation outspending opponents roughly tentoone the amendment was similar to alecs next generation charter schools act which includes the idea of an authorizing board to make it easier to establish charter schools over the objections of school districts and other school officials k inc has hired  lobbyists in  states from  through  according to the national institute on money in state politics in pennsylvania where ten percent of its revenue is generated k inc has spent  on lobbying since  according to the new york times it registered  lobbyists in the state from  through  according to the national institute on money in state politics k inc has also used ostensibly benign front groups to lobby and organize protests on its behalf the k inc funded group pennsylvania families for public cyber schools spent  on lobbying in the last five years according to the times the paper also reports that k inc is connected to my school my choice a group that organized protests in ohio against reforming the state formula for financing charter and online schools the protesters turned out to be paid temp agency workers tim dirrim the founder of the organization is the board president of the k inc managed ohio virtual academy fine print follies risk factors in sec filings in its sec filings k inc cites several aspects related to government funding and regulation of public education as risk factors that may affect its business and future prospects these risk factors often show the incentives the company has to influence public policy and the direction their advocacy would take k incs revenues depend on per pupil funding amounts and payment formulas remaining near the levels existing at the time it executes service agreements with its managed public schools the company states if those funding levels or formulas are materially reduced or modified due to economic conditions or political opposition new restrictions adopted or payments delayed our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in
