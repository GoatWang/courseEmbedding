agreement jul    et from amarc resources ltd vancouver july   prnewswire  amarc resources ltd amarc tsxv ahr otcbb axref and quartz mountain resources ltd quartz mountain tsxv qzm otcbb qzmrf announce they have entered into an amendment agreement the amendment with respect to their previously executed joint venture agreement the jv agreement on the znt and galaxie properties the properties located in central and northern british columbia bc under the terms of the amendment amarc has the right to acquire a controlling interest in both properties by funding surface exploration programs to be completed during the  field season znt is considered to hold significant potential for the discovery of bulk tonnagestyle silver deposits and galaxie for porphyry copper deposits the amendment under the terms of the amendment amarc and quartz mountain have agreed that the current single joint venture between the companies will be divided into two separate joint ventures namely the galaxie joint venture and the znt joint venture effective june   each joint venture will continue to be governed by the terms of the jv agreement the parties have also agreed to amend the option granted by quartz mountain to amarc under the original terms of the jv agreement under the amended terms amarc has an option until october   to increase its interest in both the znt and galaxie joint ventures from its current  interest to a  ownership interest by funding exploration expenditures of  and  respectively effective immediately amarc is appointed operator of both joint ventures the field programs have been permitted and are expected to commence at znt in the next few weeks followed by work at galaxie in late july through august the transactions contemplated by the amendment are subject to regulatory approval the znt and galaxie properties the square kilometre znt property located near smithers in central bc was staked by quartz mountain on the basis of significant zinc concentrations in regional till samples as reported by geoscience bc in late  approximately  grid soil geochemical samples and  line kilometres of induced polarization ip ground geophysical survey were completed these initial exploration activities defined a new and unusually strong silver and multielementinsoils anomaly measuring  kilometres by  kilometres within a more extensive and open ended anomalous trend this significant silver anomaly is coincident with an extensive ip geophysical chargeability anomaly indicating the presence of an important scale mineralizing system the galaxie property located some  kilometres south of the community of dease lake bc lies within the stikine terrane of northwestern bc a wellendowed belt of rocks that hosts a number of important copper and gold deposits such as red chris schaft creek galore and kerrsulphuretsmitchellsnowfields and brucejack the square kilometre galaxie property hosts known copper occurrences such as the gnat deposit and has excellent exploration potential  integrated field surveys including soilgrid rock and silt geochemical sampling and some line kilometres of ip geophysical survey targeted five areas in  one of these targets the hotai prospect located in the southern part of the galaxie property and largely covered by glacial sediments will be the focus of  work at hotai three discrete and largescale ip chargeability anomalies lying beneath cover were defined by last years surveys the southernmost of these chargeability anomalies occurs over  metres by  metres and is coincident with a positive magnetic feature  a diorite outcrop situated peripherally to this chargeability anomaly hosts copperbearing quartz veinlets  the second chargeability target to the north measures approximately  metres by  metres and is coincident with a pronounced annular magnetic high feature with a central magnetic low a type of magnetic feature that is classically associated with porphyry copper deposits  in addition a third potential mineralized system occurs to the northeast of these two targetareas where a significant copper and multielementinsoils anomaly exists over  metres by  metres  this target is

 the becker property covers several intermediate to low sulphidation epithermal gold‐ silver vein systems within the chilean coastal range which is geologically comprised of mesozoic age volcanic arc rocks accreted onto the south american craton gold mineralisation within the eastern part of the coastal range belt is related to the later intrusives and manifest as quartz vein systems such as the becker property to breccia pipes and vein stockworks the becker property has seen little exploration since initial discovery in  by arauco resources corporation arauco follow‐up work by arauco discovered two zones of gold‐ bearing quartz veins which extend over a strike length of approximately  kilometres figure  portion of the becker property showing location of known prospect areas

sampling by arauco identified two clusters of banded to massive epithermal quartz  sulphide veins covering at least  km each individual veins which reportedly vary from  metres to over  metres in

boulders were collected the vein characteristics observed and the sample assay results effectively confirmed vein descriptions and previous assay results reported by arauco vein textures were predominately massive fine‐grained saccaroidal with local banded cm quartz and oxidized sulphide box works suggesting minor pyrite had been present rare visible gold was seen in a few surface boulders in the south part of the lajuelas vein system further prospecting and mapping in  has identified additional veins east of both the lajuelas and guidos zones identified as the juanito prospect the

ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are material to the public report in cases where industry standard work has been done this would be relatively simple eg reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain  m samples from which  kg was pulverised to produce a  g charge for fire assay in other cases more explanation may be required such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems unusual commodities or mineralisation types eg submarine nodules may warrant disclosure of detailed information surface rock grab and chip sampling was undertaken by augur geologist within the becker tenement area sampling targeted quartz vein rubble on surface in areas of previous trenching as reported by previous workers sample size was ‐ kg per sample a total of  rock chip samples were collected along the extent of veining as reported by previous company work samples were submitted to als minerals in santiago chile for gold determination by g fire assay and additional elements including silver by icp‐aes analysis although samples were collected to be representative of the types and styles of quartz veins and mineralisation reported by previous workers no attempt was made to ensure that the samples were an accurate representation of the insitu vein
