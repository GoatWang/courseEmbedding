navigation platform customers  success partners news about contact platform customers  success partners news about contact the liability  roi of rewarding engagement accounting for loyalty program points can present a challenge to organizations looking for ways to modernize their program by expanding beyond “spend and get” to reward for engagement after all the argument goes points are a liability and creating more of them can’t be done lightly this perspective will not only keep you from much needed transformation but will also keep your program from reaching its true potential to understand why let’s take a look at the logic behind loyalty programs in the first place how marketers get trapped in accountingrelated exercises and last how we can collectively break free to modernize our programs for a truly customercentric rewards experience discount vs loyalty program prior to loyalty programs companies would offer a discount to encourage sales discounts are customer neutral meaning that anyone can redeem them — whether they are a new or existing customer intuitively some customers are worth more to the business than others however discounts do not differentiate and are just as easily redeemed by loyal customers as they are by deal seekers now if an organization applied the same discount via accrued points to loyalty program customers not only would they ensure a repeat sale but they would create goodwill and build value in the relationship the dollars are guaranteed to come back to the business when points are redeemed and even then not all points will be used accrued points the downside to this approach is that is has created a phenomenon of certain customers who like to bank their points for a future big purchase the impact of this is twofold if you are a business that tracks the value of your loyalty points in financial statements first points are a liability in the accounting sense which makes loyalty marketers concerned about creating too much liability for the organization and second as most organizations’ loyalty programs revolve around a spendandget approach there is a defined equation between revenue generated by loyalty program members and the liability they are able to create through their activity it is important to note here that while some organizations don’t track rewards on their financials at all others have created their own guidelines for doing so as there remains no standard accounting method for tracking and reporting on programcreated rewards the flip side while loyalty marketers have become sensitive to the balance between revenue and reward introducing new methodologies to this equation can be seen as challenging or at worst a threat however a fixation on the spendliability equation ignores the flip side of the coin — the impact loyal customers have to business operations to maximize the impact of a loyalty program marketers should consider how they can maximize the value of customers to their business further boosting the topline more to the point customers are maturing and demanding more from brand relationships consider that according to research by accenture  of us consumers are loyal to brands that interact with them through their preferred channels of communication increasingly that channel of choice is mobile and social indeed as reported by comscore one of every five minutes of digital media time is spent with social media of this roughly  percent is spent on mobile given all this it’s clear that there is a large opportunity to use social media as a mechanism to turn the smartphone into a key component of your loyalty program engagement loyalty drives roi bringing it all together engaging customers in these new channels–enabling them to earn rewards for their brand advocacy–allows loyalty marketers to modernize their programs and focus on the operational topline value loyal customers bring to the business by taking a social engagement approach to loyalty marketing with an emphasis on providing utility and a fair value exchange brands are able to drive social actions that not only engage customers but also create social proof earned media and wordofmouth that simultaneously serves to grow new customer acquisition moreover research from brands that have added social media components to their loyalty programs have found that socially connected members buy twice as frequently as nonconnected members and one hotelier with such a program found that its connected members in a given year spent  more than the average member they also had x more purchases than the average member in the same time period companies that track engagement loyalty find that the roi is just as attributable as with “spend and get” programs independent roi studies independent roi studies conducted by our enterprise retail and hotel customers found that their socially connected loyalty members connected via chirpify had the following data points vs nonconnected members to find out more download the roi study retail have a higher nps score  vs  have a higher trust in the brand  vs  spend more with the brand  vs  mark the brand as  in preference vs competitors  vs  hospitality spend  more x more bookings in the same time period leave liability behind traditionally brands have approached the loyalty equation with points but research featured in the international journal of hospitality management found that “providing social rewards eg a memberexclusive personal lounge health club concierge services and invitations to special events increases customers’ emotional attachment and effective commitment to a company and hence they are more likely to behave in ways that are beneficial to it” this insight is important as brands look to create a value exchange that converts in social media successful ideas for creating value in exchange for social participation and loyalty include invitations to social vip only events free upgrades or sneak peeks unique or exclusive content and the opportunity to engage with a brand celebrity — none of which result in liabilities you need to report to finance for example a leading sports retailer found that its members who were socially engaged spent on average  more per year multiply that by total connected members and it’s easy to see how the old accounting of points and liability must be modernized to reflect the new math of social engagement roi at the end of the day customers want to engage and interact with their favorite brands — and they want to be rewarded for it as they recognize the value of their time and their voice simultaneously customers at organizations who have connected social media to their loyalty program are more engaged participate and spend more with the brand positively impacting the toplineshare if you caretwitterfacebooklinkedinpocketemail chirpify helps soccercom score big with goal club rewards sports endeavors incorporated sei the

the years about bots on twitter since we invented instant transactions from a single social media action with chirpify itself being a bot on twitter since  i thought i’d share some thoughts on twitter bots and brand campaigns today there are a lot of bots on twitter and as this recent adage article points out brands are worried about it and concerned about automation in general since automation of social media marketing is inevitable as it was with email and other marketing channels brands need to get comfortable with this fact as the article points out marketers have seen their campaign metrics be skewed by bot accounts engaging with their campaigns the advertiser had asked twitter if any of the activity was from bots which twitter denied so the agency decided to scrutinize the campaign itself it turned out that between  and  of twitter activity on that particular campaign came from bots according to the agency executive  –  is a lot of “fake news” to handle as a marketer it is especially frustrating when twitter itself has provided no tools for marketers to avoid this since we’ve literally been a currency conversion between twitter and financial and loyalty programs for  years we’ve been forced to build tools specifically designed to avoid fraudulent bot activity our brand’s campaigns literally ignore bot accounts like they don’t even exist not responding to or enabling them to transact or earn points enter contests get content promo codes or any other marketing outcome enabled by the platform they do this utilizing the following features automatic bot detection our rules engine can govern campaign engagement by several criteria including geofencing influence and frequency using the influence filter brands can specify how many followers an account needs to participate in their campaign they can also specify that their campaign ignore other bot identifiers like “eggheads” accounts without profile photos or accounts that have not tweeted much or accounts that do not match other custom campaign or user criteria set by the brand member verification since chirpify is integrated with membership databases our platform can lookup customer details based on their social identity so if a brand doesn’t want any nonmembers to participate in a campaign they can block them frequency limitations our rules engine can also limit participation in campaigns based on frequency for example limiting contest entries to one twitter account or making accounts perform multiple actions to be rewarded single use promo codes and more targeting brand campaigns often involve a calltoaction instructing people to set off a social action like sharing a photo to be rewarded when they do our platform performs marketing automation rules checking automated smart responses and rewards however more brands are starting using our platform to mine social data for topics to surprise and delight consumers with a dm containing a reward or content in this case our dashboard enables brands to aggregate all posts and accounts containing the topic and review all posts for quality before responding and rewarding this gives marketers manual human control while still saving them a lot of time by having responses and rewards preloaded into the system blacklisting if a bot account does pass the rules engine qualifiers brands have a fallback – they can universally blacklist accounts preventing them from participating in any future campaigns conclusion enterprise brands have run millions of transactions through our platform making our engine

dm cards and chirpify – pushing chatbots to meaningful conversation last week twitter announced a new direct message card for advertisers the card allows brands to create ads with up to four different prompts that can be used to kickstart conversations on a specific topic with the goal of helping brands start a private chat with customers having developed chatbots since  we are excited to see twitter’s continued investment in making chatbots more accessible to marketers and customers alike if you aren’t already familiar with the new twitter direct message cards they are specially designed ads that prompt people to select a given reply from a menu of choices within the ad from this response a personal conversation will begin in twitter’s direct message tab in the case of the patron tequila ad below a person selecting one of these four responses will engage a bot in a direct message conversation with the bot suggesting cocktails based on their menu choice the new dm card according to twitter will help businesses drive discovery both through promoted tweets and organic sharing discovery which brings me to my first point about the evolution of chatbots while twitter’s dm card seeks to address one area that chatbots have traditionally struggled — discovery — chirpify has long had a solution to this issue specifically we’ve been driving chatbot discovery and engagement through the use of social triggers that can be used in any medium – from tv advertising to billboards megatrons to email – that causes an immediate conversion opportunity from offline marketing to brand chatbots while the twitter dm card helps elevate chatbots within the twitter environment chirpify can elevate chatbots across marketing channels in the process growing customer awareness engagement and conversion and once people have converted with chirpify future conversion is seamless people can stay in the twitter or other social mediamessaging context in which they are already operating loyalty drives engagement marketingland compares the new twitter dm card to moviefone in which users “dial  for…” and the bot responds with content based on that topic while this approach may engage people who are intrigued by the multichoice ad it will be important to create content that is viewed as a true value exchange for participation a proven way to do this is to connect the person’s social id to the loyalty program or crm database to gain a deeper understanding of who the person is your chatbot is interacting with and use that data to further personalize your content andor offers connecting your chatbot and loyalty program is an ideal approach for two important reasons it allows you to identify customers individually and in aggregate provides you the opportunity to offer customers loyalty program points or other valued rewards in exchange for their participation this value exchange is critical to chatbot adoption and longterm success and in the process also provides brands with significant data that informs the roi of their chatbot efforts chirpify marketing chatbots the chirpify engine provides leading brands like marriott la quinta and

facebook developer conference facebook opened its api to developers for building bots on its messenger platform since we’ve been building chatbots since  we were quite excited at the time by the potential this news provided believing that the familiar interface of social media messaging is the right channel for realtime human language chatbots both trusted by — and comfortable to — users social media messaging offers incredible upside to brands wishing to engage deeper with their customers while providing personalization and utility fast forward to this year’s f conference and facebook has again made news with its messenger platform this time around facebook has announced bot discovery through the addition of a discovery tab and messenger codes while we argued last year that discovery is undoubtedly a large challenge to conversational conversion such as that facilitated by chatbots the facebook additions are a helpful halfstep forward however to reap the benefits of chatbots and encourage customer engagement brands need three things more discovery facebook’s yellow pages will be helpful for reactive discovery of bots for example if i am looking for pizza delivery i might search for a bot to help me with that however for proactive bot discovery yellow pages aren’t ideal how many times have you proactively let your fingers do the walking i’m guessing not often similarly brands who want to proactively promote their messengerbased chat bots need to find a way to proactively drive engagement at chirpify we’ve been fueling this very kind of discovery and engagement through the use of social triggers that can be used in any medium – from tv advertising to billboards megatrons to email – that causes an immediate conversion opportunity from offline marketing to brand chatbots and while facebook has launched messenger codes which reflects this notion they are limited to images that can be snapped with a cell phone camera another limitation is that they do not connect the dots as to which customer activated the code which brings me to my second point recognize your customers in addition to driving discovery it is important that brands use the chatbot opportunity for greater recognition acknowledgement and personalization simultaneously it is increasingly important for brands to show the roi of their social media efforts to achieve both you need to integrate your messenger chatbot with the corporate crm or customer database doing so allows you to recognize your customers when they engage with your chatbot and you can create offers tailored to them reward them for taking certain actions or personally acknowledge them for their participation in addition when you tie these systems together you are able to provide closedloop analytics learning for example which customers engage with your chatbot and how when and why they use it this deeper data set on your social media customers allows you to further hone your marketing efforts for greater efficacy utility when brought all together these strategies allow you to create and drive utility for customers more than convenience utility means making it truly easy to do business with you by making your customer known to you across your customer touch points and simplifying the interaction process said another way customers want a bot to be tied to their overall brand experience and provide utility by already knowing who they are and making it incredibly easy to take the next step in participating or interacting with you of course this data can be easily obtained through the customer database and when linked to your customer’s facebook id provides a closedloop look at your customer for brands to be successful engaging consumers with chatbots they will need to connect the interface to meaningful experiences back end business processes and consumer programs that already exist within the organization loyalty programs are an ideal example as they are designed

marketplace to focus on big brand marketing and “actiontags” posted sep   by rip empson ripemp  shares next story watch a cat unlock the iphone s using touch id and the fingerprint sensor according to chirpify founder chris teso “hashtags are the new url” though more than a few people at twitter are no doubt nodding their head vigorously in agreement everywhere you turn in the tech industry someone is creating or has a patent pending on “the new new version of x” so does teso’s declaration actually ring true for starters some context chirpify launched in early  to do something about the fact that social commerce — despite its billing as “the next big thing” in ecommerce — has thus far failed to live up to the hype in an effort to make social commerce as easy as possible for average joes chirpify initially let anyone buy or sell products instream on twitter instantly using keywords and hashtags like “buy” or “gimme” fast forward to the present and chirpify has abandoned its pp consumerfacing “hashtag commerce” marketplace and is going fullon bb — and enterprise to boot like social commerce itself chirpify’s pp social payment marketplace didn’t see the dizzying adoption it hoped for so the startup has quietly shifted its focus to servicing enterprise players today chirpify has become a sort of social payment paas helping brands increase conversion across multiple channels digital and otherwise in other words chirpify is now an enterprise marketing platform — or “conversion platform” to use its lingo given chirpify’s new focus on advertising and multichannel marketing for brands teso’s claim that hashtags are dethroning urls starts to make sense in  he explains brands used urls in their advertising as a way to push users to their homepages and towards “conversion” by  brands had begun directing users to facebook brand pages whereas today he says most campaigns now include hashtags whether it’s an ad on tv in a magazine or on the web today instead of asking users to click on a facebook page or url if they want to learn more about a product or gasp buy it chirpify wants to give brands the ability to let their customers buy direct from twitter facebook or instagram though the real question is of course whether people will actually follow suit and if the ability to buy direct from social streams — that supposed ease of access — will increase the likelihood that we’ll buy the product whatever it is from a strategic standpoint while social commerce has been slow to take off teso thinks enabling brands to advertise and offer direct purchasing through social media positions chirpify at an increasingly active intersection especially between tv and digital thanks to the rise of the second screen and third and fourth etc experiences and viewing a recent nielsen study for example claims that one half of smartphone and tablet owners use their devices while watching tv looking backwards pp and bc instant instream payments was a cool idea for chirpify to begin with and remains the foundation of its new platform but in terms of demand and where people are you don’t hear much about mom and pop businesses making a billion from selling their hot cakes on twitter while twitter has hired a “head of commerce” transactions on twitter and facebook are far from commonplace the perception of social commerce as an insecure awkward and clunky transactional process remains thus chirpify shifting its focus to brands isn’t a mistake while tough for the little guys big brands celebrities and the like have found plenty of success using facebook and twitter as promotional and advertising channels — to reach and interact with their “target” audience that being said thought twitter and facebook serve well as a megaphone the problem for brands is turning those  million friends and followers into buyers and repeat buyers that’s why chirpify is now leveraging its ability to enable instant instream responses and transactions and applying that to brands’ social campaigns like product launches flash sales vip offers and contests for example the startup wants to help brands turn social channels into a more fluid conversion channel using traditional advertising as well by enabling advertisers and shows to include hashtag actions like vote buy etc to get users signing up on websites facebook pages interacting with content or making purchases or at least that’s the idea chirpify’s newest addition to its marketing arsenal which launches officially today is called “actiontags” which teso describes as the “logical evolution of hashtags” essentially as one might expect actiontags give brands the ability to activate hashtags and turn social media channels into an actual point of conversion crosschannelstyle like the chirpify of old these actiontags allow people to make purchases enter contests donate subscribe and so on by posting a hashtag — no actiontag — on twitter facebook or instagram thanks to the wizardry of mobile devices and a little thing called the intertubes people can do this from anywhere while watching tv in a hot tub on a boat from the front of a parade or the back of a concert sounds fishy how does it work exactly you ask basically brands define define the actiontags buy donate etc and the campaigntag whatever’s being sold say hotroombadecals and then advertise them whereupon customers can respond by posting both tags and transact irobot could include “post buy roombadecals to purchase” at the end of a tv advertisement for example and all users need to do is tweet facebook or instagram that and chirpify processes the order in becoming a bb social conversion service chirpify is also offering a bunch of stuff on the backend of its platform to help businesses collect data on how their users are interacting with their brands on social media — and make smarter decisions accordingly plus campaign strategy design planning and all that jazz teso tells us that since launching in february  chirpify has seen hundreds of brands and merchants list over  products on the platform and that it’s currently seeing a  percent conversion rate instream since the beginning of the year — also the point at which the ceo says it made the shift away from consumers — revenue has been doubling monthovermonth it’s allowed the company to “touch bigger budgets” with the average
