commercial properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately  billion as of the cutoff date the loans were contributed to the trust by goldman sachs mortgage company citigroup global

collateral including site inspections on  of the properties by balance cash flow analysis of  and asset summary reviews on  of the pool key rating drivers fitch leverage the transaction has higher

only and  loans  are partial interest only with the remaining  loans  being balloon loans mortgage coupons the pools weighted average coupon is  well below historical averages fitch accounted for increased refinance risk in a higher interest rate environment by reviewing an interest rate sensitivity that assumes an interest rate floor of  for the term risk for most property types  for multifamily properties and  for hotel properties in conjunction with fitchs stressed refinance rates which were  on a weightedaverage basis rating sensitivities for this transaction fitchs net cash flow ncf was  below the most recent net operating income noi for properties for which a recent noi was provided excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period unanticipated further declines in propertylevel ncf could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to gsms gc certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in ncf in a scenario in which ncf declined a further  from fitchs ncf a downgrade of the senior aaasf certificates to asf could result in a more severe scenario in which ncf declined a further  from fitchs ncf a downgrade of the senior aaasf certificates to bbbsf could

requests the court to instruct the trustee the trust beneficiaries and any other interested parties as to the amount of the disputed proceeds if any that constitute penalty interest andor the amount of the disputed proceeds if any that constitute gainonsale proceeds with respect to each trust on february   cwcam made a limited appearance with the court to file a motion to dismiss this proceeding based on lack of jurisdiction mootness standing and forum non conveniens  there can be no assurances as to the outcome of this motion or the proceeding or the possible impact on cwcam however cwcam believes that it has performed its obligations under the related pooling and servicing agreements in good faith and that the disputed proceeds were properly allocated to cwcam as penalty interest and it intends to vigorously contest any claim that such disputed proceeds were improperly allocated as penalty interest    on june   a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county against wells fargo bank na in its capacity as trustee under  residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” trusts which was later amended on july   to increase the number of trusts to  rmbs trusts  on november   the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice  that same day a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the “district court” against wells fargo bank alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for  rmbs trusts the “complaint” in december  the plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted  as with the prior state court action the complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against rmbs trustees deutsche bank citibank hsbc bank of new york mellon and us bank by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs  the complaint against wells fargo bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon among other things the trustees alleged failure to i enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties ii notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers and iii abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount reimbursement of expenses and equitable relief  other cases collectively the “additional complaints” alleging similar causes of action have been filed against wells fargo bank and other trustees in the same court by rmbs investors in these and other transactions and these cases have been consolidated before the same judge on january   an order was entered in connection with the complaint in which the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over  trusts at issue in the complaint the district court also allowed plaintiffs to file amended complaints if they so chose and three amended complaints have been filed there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the rmbs trusts however wells fargo bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the rmbs trusts in good faith that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously on june   a group of investors including funds managed by blackrock advisors llc pimcoadvisors lp and others filed a derivative action against deutsche bank trust company americas “dbtca” and deutsche bank national trust company “dbntc”  in new york state supreme court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of  privatelabel rmbs trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the us trust indenture act of  tia breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on dbntc and dbtca’s alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts plaintiffs subsequently dismissed their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class action complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of and for the benefit of  privatelabel rmbs trusts which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in the state court action the complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of us  billion but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain dbntc and dbtca filed a motion to dismiss and on january   the court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds as to the  trusts that are governed by pooling and servicing agreements the court declined to exercise jurisdiction the court did not rule on substantive defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss as to the  trusts formed under indentures for which it retained jurisdiction  instead the court ordered plaintiffs to file an amended complaint as to those indenture trusts on february   plaintiffs filed an amended complaint as to  of the  indenture trusts included in the original us district court complaint dbntc and dbtca will have an opportunity to file new defensive motions with respect to this amended complaint it is anticipated that plaintiffs will in the near future file a new state court complaint as to some or all of the  trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements which were dismissed from the us district court action  on december   ikb international sa and ikb deutsche industriebank ag filed a summons with notice in new york state court naming as defendants dbntc and dbtca as trustees of  rmbs trusts the “ikb action”  the claims in the ikb action appear to be substantively similar to the sdny action  the ikb action is not styled as a putative class action but may attempt to bring derivative claims on behalf of the named rmbs trusts  dbtca intends to vigorously defend the ikb action dbtca has no pending legal proceedings including based on dbtcas present evaluation the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties as trustee under the pooling and servicing agreement for the cgcmt p transaction and the trust and servicing agreement for the cgbam smrt transaction and as trustee and custodian under the pooling and servicing agreement for the cgcmt gc transaction on june   a civil action was filed against citibank na “citibank” in the supreme court of the state of new york by a group of investors in  privatelabel rmbs trusts for which citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee asserting claims for purported violations of the trust indenture act of  breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on citibank’s alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the  rmbs trusts  on november   plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action  on the same day a smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in  privatelabel rmbs trusts for which citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee filed a new civil action against citibank in the united states district court for the southern district of new york asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court  in january  the court closed plaintiffs’ original state court action  citibank’s motion to dismiss the federal complaint was fully briefed as of may    on september   the federal court dismissed all claims as to  of the  trusts and allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts that case involving the three remaining trusts is pending on november   the same investors that brought the federal case brought a new civil action in the supreme court of the state of new york related to  privatelabel rmbs trusts for which citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee  this case includes the  trusts previously dismissed in the federal action and one additional trust  the investors assert claims for breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest and violation of new york’s streit act  citibank filed a motion to dismiss this case on february   on august   the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” as receiver for a financial institution filed a civil action against citibank in the southern district of new york  this action relates to one privatelabel rmbs trust for which citibank formerly served as trustee  fdic asserts claims for breach of contract violation of the streit act and violation of the trust indenture act citibank is jointly briefing a motion to dismiss with the bank of new york mellon and us bank entities that have also been sued by fdic in their capacity as trustee and whose cases are all in front of judge carter there can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the possible impact of litigation on the trustee or the rmbs trusts  however citibank denies liability and continues to vigorously defend against these litigations  furthermore neither the abovedisclosed litigations nor any other pending legal proceeding involving citibank will materially affect citibank’s ability to perform its duties as certificate administrator under the pooling and servicing agreement for the cgcmt p transaction and the pooling and servicing agreement for the cgcmt gc transaction and as certificate administrator and custodian under the trust and servicing agreement for the cgbam smrt transaction since  various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs primarily investors have filed claims against us bank national association “us bank” in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee as the case may be under certain residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” trusts the plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other rmbs trustees including deutsche bank citibank hsbc bank of new york mellon and wells fargo the complaints against us bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these rmbs trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality the complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default currently us bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with the most substantial case being blackrock balanced capital portfolio et al v us bank national association no  ny sup ct class action alleging claims with respect to approximately  trusts and its companion case blackrock core bond portfolio et al v us bank national association no cv sdny some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned blackrock cases as well as other trusts are involved in actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than  trusts per case there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any of the litigation or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the rmbs trusts however us bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the rmbs trusts in good faith that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously   item  of regulation ab
