other climbers congratulating oh on her accomplishment south korean president lee myungbak said she showed us what challenge means oh completed her descent from annapurna on may  accomplishment disputededit ohs  summit of kangchenjunga has been questioned throwing her accomplishment into doubt the dispute stems from a photograph said to have been taken by oh at the summit which is too blurry to confirm exactly where she stood when she took it the photo is the only visible evidence she has of her ascent after doubts were first raised in korea oh held a press conference in which she tearfully remarked that the blurriness was unavoidable due to fog and a violent snowstorm one of the sherpas who accompanied her on the climb assured the media that he knew the layout of the mountain well from previous climbs and that oh had indeed made the summit in april  ohs main rival edurne pasaban from spain who was also aiming to become the first woman to climb all fourteen eightthousanders weighed in on the controversy pasabán spoke with oh and her team while descending annapurna pasabáns thirteenth eightthousander after pasabán spoke with elizabeth hawley upon descending hawley agreed to mark ohs summit of kangchenjunga as disputed in her himalayan database on april  hawley explained her decision the only picture that anyone has seen shows miss oh standing on bare rock but miss pasabán who was on the mountain at the same time showed me a picture of her team on the summit and they are standing on snow she added that of the three sherpas that climbed with miss oh two have said she did not reach the summit the latter comment apparently stems from conversations pasabán had with said sherpas while on annapurna although her data is unofficial hawley is considered the final arbiter on such disputes hawley still counts the climb as valid but plans to do further investigation ferran latorre a spanish climber claimed that the green rope affixed to the mountain by ohs team visible in the picture stopped  meters short of the summit eberhard jurgalski of erscom a website devoted to keeping mountaineering records said its all mixed up you cannot say what is true and whats invented on april   nepal mountaineering association president ang tshering said we recognize ohs achievement as the first woman climber to scale all the highest mountains in the world erscom also credits oh with having completed all fourteen eightthousanders the nepalese government also stated that it believes oh climbed kangchenjunga explorersweb looked into the disputed summit in detail in  before it made headlines and concluded that the dispute was based largely on third parties confusing go miyoungs team who was climbing at the same time with ohs and a misunderstanding about the starting point of ohs final push the organization concluded that doubts about miss ohs kanchen summit were not backed by enough fact but said it would happy to review any new evidence the involved parties had to offer reinhold messner the first person to climb all fourteen eightthousanders also acknowledged ohs achievement after meeting with her responseedit on april  ohs sponsor responded on her behalf while she was climbing annapurna according to a press release by black yak there were several teams on the mountain at the time and none of them doubted ohs summit then at the time pasabán herself wrote korean oh eun sun just reached the top in spite of the wind the release goes on to say the kangchenjunga summit is not visible by telescope even during good weather so it was not surprising no one can visually verify ohs summit it states that oh was last seen at  m  hours and  minutes before the claimed summit time veteran climbers have said that that is a realistic time frame finally according to the release the final  meters of the mountain are comparatively gentle so fixed rope is not a necessary option others including pasabán have scaled that portion of the mountain without the use of fixed rope for her part pasabán remarked i am confused had i known this socalled race was going to be such a mess i would have thought twice before getting involved after descending from annapurna oh addressed the allegations on may  i am really sad that it has come to this she said oh claimed that koreas kbs television had video and picture evidence of her summit that had not yet been made public rejecting pasabáns claims oh added i believe that according to pasabán some sherpas told her that i hadnt climbed kangchenjunga but no names of the sherpas have been mentioned why on may  pasabán specified the names of seven sherpas involved she declined to give these names earlier as some of these sherpas were still working for oh oh has no plans to reclimb kangchenjunga acknowledgement by hawleyedit on may   oh had an hourlong discussion with elizabeth hawley in kathmandu in which she asked oh about the details of her kangchenjunga climb at the conclusion of the interview hawley asked oh if she had really conquered all  eightthousanders to which oh replied yes i did hawley reportedly replied congratulations indicating the feat would continue to be acknowledged oh will be credited for her climb to kangchenjunga she later told the press her account was completely different from pasabáns so i really dont know who is right she added hawleys database will continue to list the climb as disputed unless pasabán withdraws her complaint pasabán had previously said she would respect hawleys decision either way on may  pasabán conceded that she was the second woman to climb worlds  highest peaks but still questioned whether oh actually held the recordclarification needed hawley stated i think its likely that miss ohs climb is going to be disputed for the rest of her life and that evidence was piling up against her korean alpine federation statementedit on august   the korean alpine federation kaf judged that oh probably failed to reach the top of kangchenjunga the kaf secretary general lee euijae said participants in the meeting all shared the view that miss ohs photographs on kangchenjunga did not seem to match the actual landscape and that ohs previous explanations on the process of her ascent to kangchenjunga are unreliable oh responded to the verdict by describing it as a unilateral opinion and adding that all participants in the meeting  seven korean climbers who had scaled kangchenjunga previously  were climbers who had doubts about my achievement from the beginning so their conclusion must have been already set hawley declared it would seem her only choice now is to go back and climb it again with lots of clear photos next team to reach the peakedit bbc news also reported on  august  that a member of the next team to reach the peak of kangchenjunga in may  the norwegian climber jon gangdal says he found ms ohs korean flag weighed down by stones some m or m below the summit climbing strategy and inspirationedit oh has used helicopters to travel between base camps and employed teams to prepare for her ascents in advance she is under the sponsorship of black yak a south korean outdoor product maker she has been nicknamed iron woman and squirrel for her climbing accomplishments oh was criticized for failing to come to the aid of ailing spanish climber tolo calafat who died on annapurna while waiting for help oh responded that she was unaware that calafat was sick until after she had descended and was no longer able to help we reached the summit around  pm and the spanish climber got there an hour later by the time we got back down to camp  we were all exhausted oh said adding that she really wanted to help but was not in a state to climb the seven hours back up the slopes and rescue him oh lists former rival go miyoung who plummeted to her death in  after completing  eightthousanders as a source of inspiration she has described mountain climbing as a sort

same time showed me a picture of her team on the summit and they are standing on snow she added that of the three sherpas that climbed with miss oh two have said she did not reach the summit the latter comment apparently stems from conversations pasabán had with said sherpas while on annapurna although her data is unofficial hawley is considered the final arbiter on such disputes hawley still counts the climb as valid but plans to do further investigation ferran latorre a spanish climber claimed that the green rope affixed to the mountain by ohs team visible in the picture stopped  meters

final push the organization concluded that doubts about miss ohs kanchen summit were not backed by enough fact but said it would happy to review any new evidence the involved parties had to offer reinhold messner the first person to climb all fourteen eightthousanders also acknowledged ohs achievement after meeting with her responseedit on april  ohs sponsor responded on her behalf while she was climbing annapurna according to a press release by black yak there were several teams on the mountain at the time and none of them doubted ohs summit then at the time pasabán herself wrote korean oh eun sun just reached the top in spite of the wind the release goes on to say the kangchenjunga summit is not visible by telescope even during good weather so it was not surprising no one can visually verify ohs summit it states that oh was last seen at  m  hours and  minutes before the claimed summit time veteran climbers have said that that is a realistic time frame finally according to the release the final  meters of the mountain are comparatively gentle so fixed rope is not a necessary option others including pasabán have scaled that portion of the mountain without the use of fixed rope for her part pasabán remarked i am confused had i known this socalled race was going to be such a mess i would have thought twice before getting involved after descending from annapurna oh addressed the allegations on may  i am really sad that it has come to this she said oh claimed that koreas kbs television had video and picture evidence of her summit that had not yet been made public rejecting pasabáns claims oh added i believe that according to pasabán some sherpas told her that i hadnt climbed kangchenjunga but no names of the sherpas have been mentioned why on may  pasabán

oh if she had really conquered all  eightthousanders to which oh replied yes i did hawley reportedly replied congratulations indicating the feat would continue to be acknowledged oh will be credited for her climb to kangchenjunga she later told the press her account was completely different from pasabáns so i really dont know who is right she added hawleys database will continue to list the climb as disputed unless pasabán withdraws her complaint pasabán had previously said she would respect hawleys decision either way on may  pasabán conceded that she was the second woman to climb worlds  highest peaks but still questioned whether oh actually held the recordclarification needed hawley stated i think its likely that miss ohs climb is going to be disputed for the rest of her life and that evidence was piling up against her korean alpine federation statementedit on august   the korean alpine federation kaf judged that oh probably failed to reach the top of kangchenjunga the kaf secretary general lee euijae said participants in the meeting all shared the view that miss ohs photographs on kangchenjunga did not seem to match the actual landscape and that ohs previous explanations on the process of her ascent to kangchenjunga are unreliable oh responded to the verdict by describing it as a unilateral opinion and adding that all participants in the meeting  seven korean climbers who had scaled kangchenjunga previously  were climbers who had doubts about my achievement from the beginning so their conclusion must have been already set hawley declared it would

broadcasting the climb live and thanked her fellow koreans for being with her throughout the whole expedition she was accompanied by five other climbers congratulating oh on her accomplishment south korean president lee myungbak said she showed us what challenge means oh completed her descent from annapurna on may  accomplishment disputededit ohs  summit of kangchenjunga has been questioned throwing her accomplishment into doubt the dispute stems from a photograph said to have been taken by oh at the summit which is too blurry to confirm exactly where she stood when she took it the photo is the only visible evidence she has of her ascent after doubts were first raised in korea oh held a press conference in which she tearfully remarked that the blurriness was unavoidable due to fog and a violent snowstorm one of the sherpas who accompanied her on the climb assured the media that he knew the layout of the mountain well from previous climbs and that oh had indeed made the summit in april  ohs main rival edurne pasaban from spain who was also aiming to become the first woman to climb all fourteen eightthousanders weighed in on the controversy pasabán spoke with oh and her team while descending annapurna pasabáns thirteenth eightthousander after pasabán spoke with elizabeth hawley upon descending hawley agreed to mark ohs summit of kangchenjunga as disputed in her himalayan database on april  hawley explained her decision the only picture that anyone has seen shows miss oh standing on bare rock but miss pasabán who was on the mountain at the same time showed me a picture of her team on the summit and they are standing on snow she added that of the three sherpas that climbed with miss oh two have said she did not reach the summit the latter comment apparently stems from conversations pasabán had with said sherpas while on annapurna although her data is unofficial hawley is considered the final arbiter on such disputes hawley still counts the climb as valid but plans to do further investigation ferran latorre a spanish climber claimed that the green rope affixed to the mountain by ohs team visible in the picture stopped  meters short of the summit eberhard jurgalski of erscom a website devoted to keeping mountaineering records said its all mixed up you cannot say what is true and whats invented on april   nepal mountaineering association president ang tshering said we recognize ohs achievement as the first woman climber to scale all the highest mountains in the world erscom also credits oh with having completed all fourteen eightthousanders the nepalese government also stated that it believes oh climbed kangchenjunga explorersweb looked into the disputed summit in detail in  before it made headlines and concluded that the dispute was based largely on third parties confusing go miyoungs team who was climbing at the same time with ohs and a misunderstanding about the starting point of ohs final push the organization concluded that doubts about miss ohs kanchen summit were not backed by enough fact but said it would happy to review any new evidence the involved parties had to offer reinhold messner the first person to climb all fourteen eightthousanders also acknowledged ohs achievement after meeting with her responseedit on april  ohs sponsor responded on her behalf while she was climbing annapurna according to a press release by black yak there were several teams on the mountain at the time and none of them doubted ohs summit then at the time pasabán herself wrote korean oh eun sun just reached the top in spite of the wind the release goes on to say the kangchenjunga summit is not visible by telescope even during good weather so it was not surprising no one can visually verify ohs summit it states that oh was last seen at  m  hours and  minutes before the claimed summit time veteran climbers have said that that is a realistic time frame finally according to the release the final  meters of the mountain are comparatively gentle so fixed rope is not a necessary option others including pasabán have scaled that portion of the mountain without the use of fixed rope for her part pasabán remarked i am confused had i known this socalled race was going to be such a mess i would have thought twice before getting involved after descending from annapurna oh addressed the allegations on may  i am really sad that it has come to this she said oh claimed that koreas kbs television had video and picture evidence of her summit that had not yet been made public rejecting pasabáns claims oh added i believe that according to pasabán some sherpas told her that i hadnt climbed kangchenjunga but no names of the sherpas have been mentioned why on may  pasabán specified the names of seven sherpas involved she declined to give these names earlier as some of these sherpas were still working for oh oh has no plans to reclimb kangchenjunga acknowledgement by hawleyedit on may   oh had an hourlong discussion with elizabeth hawley in kathmandu in which she asked oh about the details of her kangchenjunga climb at the conclusion of the interview hawley asked oh if she had really conquered all  eightthousanders to which oh replied yes i did hawley reportedly replied congratulations indicating the feat would continue to be acknowledged oh will be credited for her climb to kangchenjunga she later told the press her account was completely different from pasabáns so i really dont know who is right she added hawleys database will continue to list the climb as disputed unless pasabán withdraws her complaint pasabán had previously said she would respect hawleys decision either way on may  pasabán conceded that she was the second woman to climb worlds  highest peaks but still questioned whether oh actually held the recordclarification needed hawley stated i think its likely that miss ohs climb is going to be disputed for the rest of her life and that evidence was piling up against her korean alpine federation statementedit on august   the korean alpine federation kaf judged that oh probably failed to reach the top of kangchenjunga the kaf secretary general lee euijae said participants in the meeting all shared the view that miss ohs photographs on kangchenjunga did not seem to match the actual landscape and that ohs previous explanations on the process of her ascent to kangchenjunga are unreliable oh responded to the verdict by describing it as a unilateral opinion and adding that all participants in the meeting  seven korean climbers who had scaled kangchenjunga previously  were climbers who had doubts about my achievement from the beginning so their conclusion must have been already set hawley declared it would seem her only choice now is to go back and climb it again with lots of clear photos next team to reach the peakedit bbc news also reported on  august  that a member of the next team to reach the peak of kangchenjunga in may  the norwegian climber jon gangdal says he found ms ohs korean flag weighed down by stones some m or m below the summit climbing strategy and inspirationedit oh has used helicopters to travel between base camps and employed teams to prepare for her ascents in advance she is under the sponsorship of black yak a south korean outdoor product maker she has been nicknamed iron woman and squirrel for her climbing accomplishments oh was criticized for failing to come to the aid of ailing spanish climber tolo calafat who died on annapurna while waiting for help oh responded that she was unaware that calafat was sick until after she had descended and was no longer able to help we reached the summit around  pm and the spanish climber got there an hour later by the time we got back down to camp  we were all exhausted oh said adding that she really wanted to help but was not in a state to climb the seven hours back up the slopes and rescue him oh lists former rival go miyoung who plummeted to her death in  after completing  eightthousanders as a source of inspiration she has described mountain climbing as a sort of addiction which is much stronger than any drug mountaineering

the wind the release goes on to say the kangchenjunga summit is not visible by telescope even during good weather so it was not surprising no one can visually verify ohs summit it states that oh was last seen at  m  hours and  minutes before the claimed summit time veteran climbers have said that that is a realistic time frame finally according to the release the final  meters of the mountain are comparatively gentle so fixed rope is not a necessary option others including pasabán have scaled that portion of the mountain without the use of fixed rope for her part pasabán remarked i am confused had i known this socalled race was going to be such a mess i would have thought twice before getting involved after descending from annapurna oh addressed the allegations on may  i am really sad that it has come to this she said oh claimed that koreas kbs television had video and picture evidence of her summit that had not yet been made public rejecting pasabáns claims oh added i believe that according to pasabán some sherpas told her that i hadnt climbed kangchenjunga but no names of the sherpas have been mentioned why on may  pasabán specified the names of seven sherpas involved she

eightthousanders to which oh replied yes i did hawley reportedly replied congratulations indicating the feat would continue to be acknowledged oh will be credited for her climb to kangchenjunga she later told the press her account was completely different from pasabáns so i really dont know who is right she added hawleys database will continue to list the climb as disputed unless pasabán withdraws her complaint pasabán had previously said she would respect hawleys decision either way on may  pasabán conceded that she was the second woman to climb worlds  highest peaks but still questioned whether oh actually held the recordclarification needed hawley stated i think its likely that miss ohs climb is going to be disputed for the rest of her life and that evidence was piling up

said participants in the meeting all shared the view that miss ohs photographs on kangchenjunga did not seem to match the actual landscape and that ohs previous explanations on the process of her ascent to kangchenjunga are unreliable oh responded to the verdict by describing it as a unilateral opinion and adding that all participants in the meeting  seven korean climbers who had scaled kangchenjunga previously  were climbers who had doubts about my achievement from the beginning so their conclusion must have been already set hawley declared it would seem her only choice now is to go

eunsun korean 오은선 hanja  born march   is a south korean female mountaineer she is the first korean woman to climb the seven summits on april   she reached the annapurna summit oh claimed she had climbed all fourteen eightthousanders which would have made her the first woman to achieve this feat but her claim to have ascended kangchenjunga was disputed by multiple experts oh eunsun later admitted that she had to stop a few hundred meters before the kangchenjunga summit — therefore the korean alpine federation ruled that oh did not climb that peak and the mountaineering site

early lifeedit oh was born in namwon jeollabukdo before taking up climbing she studied engineering at the university of suwon in gyeonggi province after completing the  eightthousanders she said she would take a break from climbing for three to four years the last few years have been too tiring now i am going to rest she said she plans to attend graduate school and do charity work during her break race to complete all  eightthousandersedit on july   oh summitted gasherbrum ii without supplementary oxygen completing her first climb to a summit of over  meters over the next several years she attempted several eightthousanders without success in  she climbed mount everest with the aid of supplementary oxygen in  she added scaling shishapangma to her list of accomplishments at the time two women edurne pasabán and gerlinde kaltenbrunner had completed nine different eightthousanders to ohs three in  she conquered cho oyu and k bringing her total ers to five two other women achieved their th such climb that year in  oh added four more  meter climbs while the leaders in the chase for all  added only one each on may   oh claimed to have summited kangchenjunga the worlds thirdhighest mountain see below in so doing she became just the third woman to conquer the mountain and first from korea the accomplishment also made her the first woman to scale the worlds five highest peaks it was her th different er on august   oh reached the summit of gasherbrum i after a twelvehour climb from camp  in april  oh made her second attempt at climbing annapurna the last of the eightthousanders a previous attempt in october  came up  meters short when a blizzard made further ascent impossible as she approached the top strong winds and snow delayed further ascent on april  oh reached camp c located at  m but was forced to retreat the next day due to wind she announced that she would delay her summit attempt on april  oh took  hours to climb from c m to c on april   oh left camp c located at  meters on annapurna thirteen hours later she reached the summit at pm local time completing her quest upon reaching the peak she planted a south korean flag waved to the camera which was broadcasting the climb live and thanked her fellow koreans for being with her throughout the whole expedition she was accompanied by five other climbers congratulating oh on her accomplishment south korean president lee myungbak said she showed us what challenge means oh completed her descent from annapurna on may  accomplishment disputededit ohs  summit of kangchenjunga has been questioned throwing her accomplishment into doubt the dispute stems from a photograph said to have been taken by oh at the summit which is too blurry to confirm exactly where she stood when she took it the photo is the only visible evidence she has of her ascent after doubts were first raised in korea oh held a press conference in which she tearfully remarked that the blurriness was unavoidable due to fog and a violent snowstorm one of the sherpas who accompanied her on the climb assured the media that he knew the layout of the mountain well from previous climbs and that oh had indeed made the summit in april  ohs main rival edurne pasaban from spain who was also aiming to become the first woman to climb all fourteen eightthousanders weighed in on the controversy pasabán spoke with oh and her team while descending annapurna pasabáns thirteenth eightthousander after pasabán spoke with elizabeth hawley upon descending hawley agreed to mark ohs summit of kangchenjunga as disputed in her himalayan database on april  hawley explained her decision the only picture that anyone has seen shows miss oh standing on bare rock but miss pasabán who was on the mountain at the same time showed me a picture of her team on the summit and they are standing on snow she added that of the three sherpas that climbed with miss oh two have said she did not reach the summit the latter comment apparently stems from conversations pasabán had with said sherpas while on annapurna although her data is unofficial hawley is considered the final arbiter on such disputes hawley still counts the climb as valid but plans to do further investigation ferran latorre a spanish climber claimed that the green rope affixed to the mountain by ohs team visible in the picture stopped  meters short of the summit eberhard jurgalski of erscom a website devoted to keeping mountaineering records said its all mixed up you cannot say what is true and whats invented on april   nepal mountaineering association president ang tshering said we recognize ohs achievement as the first woman climber to scale all the highest mountains in the world erscom also credits oh with having completed all fourteen eightthousanders the nepalese government also stated that it believes oh climbed kangchenjunga explorersweb looked into the disputed summit in detail in  before it made headlines and concluded that the dispute was based largely on third parties confusing go miyoungs team who was climbing at the same time with ohs and a misunderstanding about the starting point of ohs final push the organization concluded that doubts about miss ohs kanchen summit were not backed by enough fact but said it would happy to review any new evidence the involved parties had to offer
