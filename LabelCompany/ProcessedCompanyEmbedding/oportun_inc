directorsinvestorsabout oportun background context – the need for responsible small dollar credit if you are one of the  million people in the us who has littleorno credit history your options are limited if you need to borrow money to fix your car pay the security deposit on a new rental apartment or get through a medical emergency people with scant credit history are considered “unscoreable” by the three major credit bureaus that means some of the options many of us rely on for unexpected expenses – like credit cards – simply aren’t an option for them unfortunately most mainstream financial institutions haven’t figured out how to evaluate the risk profile or likelihood of repayment of someone who lacks a credit score – or how to make serving such a population profitable enough to warrant the effort sometimes the only option available to individuals with limited credit history is to turn to payday autotitle or pawn loans some of these alternatives may have high rates or unrealistic payment terms because many of these alternatives do not report customer accounts to credit bureaus these loans do not necessarily help individuals establish the credit history and score they need the company oportun is a financial technology company founded in  with the mission of providing affordable loans to us latinos and others with little or no credit history so they can
