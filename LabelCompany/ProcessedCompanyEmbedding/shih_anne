us site faq home → dog breeds → shih tzus → shih tzu faq frequently asked questions about shih tzus by michele welton copyright   how big are shih tzus the traditional size for the shih tzu is  inches at the shoulder and  pounds but some individuals are smaller in the  pound range have you heard these phrases imperial shih tzu teacup shih tzu tiny toy shih tzu miniature shih tzu some breeders use those cutesy madeup phrases as marketing terms for smaller shih tzu thats all they are – marketing terms there is only one shih tzu breed whether an individual weighs  pounds or  pounds hes still just a shih tzu some are simply smaller or larger than others the larger individuals are sturdier and make safer pets for many families where does the shih tzu come from and why was the breed developed the shih tzu was developed in china possibly tibet as a lapdog companion for chinese royalty how is shih tzu pronounced and what does it mean the chinese pronunciation is roughly shirr dza but the western pronunciation is sheetsue the name means lion dog and refers to the regal look of the breed for more than one shih tzu do you say shih tzus officially shih tzu is both singular and plural just as deer or sheep can mean one individual or many unofficially many people do say shih tzu for one dog and shih tzus for more than one what kind of temperament and personality does the shih tzu have i give you my honest opinions about shih tzu temperament and personality  positives and negatives  in my dog breed review shih tzu temperament whats good about em whats bad about em what colors do shih tzus come in shih tzus can be any color solid particolor and blends usually they have a white blaze on their face do shih tzus come in longhaired and shorthaired varieties no their natural coat is always longhaired silky and dense and its a double coat which means an outer coat plus an insulating undercoat many owners choose to minimize brushing and keep their shih tzu looking like a perpetual puppy very cute by shearing clipping the coat short several times a year you can do this yourself or have a professional groomer do it how much grooming do shih tzus need if you keep the coat long coat care is a major consideration requiring daily brushing and combing to avoid mats and tangles which can be quite painful as they pull on your dogs skin whenever he moves the worst places for mats and tangles are behind their ears behind their front legs in their armpits and on their chest stomach and groin their legs and paws also need to be kept combed and their tail and you should clip their groin and anal area short so it stays clean and sanitary when your dog goes to the bathroom how much do shih tzus shed it depends on whether you keep their coat long or short all shih tzus shed some hairs here and there throughout the year with the bulk of their shedding occurring twice a year for three weeks in the spring as their winter coat switches over to a cooler summer coat and three weeks in the fall as their summer coat switches over to a thicker winter coat but if you keep the coat long their shed hair gets caught in the long coat and only comes out when you brush them instead of falling onto your floor and furniture whereas if you clip the coat short the hair can now fall out freely so shearing the coat means less brushing but more obvious shedding while keeping the coat long means more brushing but less shedding though often touted as hypoallergenic and lowshedding shih tzus are neither however some allergic people do okay with this breed as long as they keep the coat long enough to catch the shedding hairs and commit to brushing are there any health concerns with their short face or their shortlegged longbacked build yes some shih tzus are more normallooking than others more normallooking shih tzus have a face muzzle that is a little longer legs that are a little longer and straighter a body that is a little shorter andor eyes that are smaller and less protruding other shih tzus have a very squashed face large protruding eyes stubby bowed legs andor a very long body the more normallooking a shih tzu is the better a shih tzu can be a great little dog but the reality is that his physical build is neither natural or healthy the shih tzu in fact is afflicted with two skeletal deformities chondrodysplasia and brachycephalic syndrome dogs were never intended to have a long back and short legs especially if the legs are bowed like queen anne furniture legs this build is caused by a genetic skeletal deformity called chondrodysplasia which translates roughly to faulty cartilage when a puppy is developing in the womb his skeleton is first formed in cartilage as a sort of model as he continues to develop the cartilage is supposed to be replaced by bone but if because of certain inherited genes the cartilage doesnt transform properly into normal bone the puppy will be born with incorrect proportions of cartilage and bone the result is a large head and chest short thick bowed front legs and a longish back with calcified disks that lack elasticity and cushioning powers and are predisposed to coming loose and protruding into the spinal canal intervertebral disk disease chondrodysplastic dogs are also more susceptible to joint problems and later in life arthritis the other deformity of the shih tzu is called brachycephalia brakahsafailya this tongue twisting word comes from the greek roots brachy meaning short and cephalic meaning head a rounded head and shortened face are skeletal deformities that cause a variety of health problems all shortfaced dogs have some trouble breathing they snuffle and snort their way through life with their breathing difficulties becoming worse when theyre excited their nostrils tend to be slim and pinched and may have soft cartilage that cause the nostrils to collapse when the dog tries to pull air in forcefully the trachea windpipe tends to be narrow restricting air flow even more the soft palate a flap of skin across the back of the throat that prevents food and water from entering the windpipe is often fleshy and elongated and tends to fall loosely into the throat this causes noisy breathing gagging and hacking as though the dog has mucous in his throat and sometimes spitting up white froth the eye sockets are shallow which means the eyes could actually pop out if the dog bangs his head while playing or even pulls too hard on the leash the prominent eyeball is susceptible to scratches and corneal ulcers if the eyelid cant reach out far enough to fully cover the protruding eyeball the eye can dry out leading to a serious disorder called appropriately dry eye the teeth are crowded together and tend to grow at odd angles trapping food debris and leading to dental disease their loose folds of facial skin are dark warm and moist  perfect breeding grounds for bacteria the result can be raw irritated skin and chronic bacterial infections called pyoderma skin fold dermatitis eating and drinking can cause problems because when they put their face into a bowl and try to coordinate swallowing and breathing food particles and water can get pulled through their nose and into their windpipe causing gagging coughing or spitting up on a more delicate note breathing through the mouth means swallowing air which often produces excessive gas shortfaced dogs frequently cant deliver their puppies because the puppies have such large rounded heads csections under general anesthesia are typically required and shortfaced puppies are exceptionally fragile and have a higher mortality rate than puppies with normal heads shortfaced dogs are risky to anesthetize requiring extraspecial precautions for neutering dental cleaning and xrays brachycephalic syndrome isnt a disease that your shih tzu might get its a syndrome that all shortfaced dogs are born with their respiratory system is structurally compromised and they all suffer some degree of associated health problems some things you can do to help your shih tzu keep him slim extra weight means that he has to breathe harder to carry it around wash and dry his face after every meal or long drink of water in hot or humid weather keep him in an airconditioned home as much as possible when he goes outside in hot or humid weather dont let him get overexcited or overactive shortfaced dogs have a high risk of heatstroke because they cant pant vigorously enough to lower their body heat never leave him alone in a car even if it doesnt seem particularly warm outside to you and even with the windows rolled down partway heat and stuffiness can build up rapidly and a shortfaced dog can die teach him not to pull on the leash or else walk him with a harness a collar puts pressure on his windpipe make sure the harness is shaped so that it wraps around his chest not around his throat a yshaped harness is what you want not a figureshaped harness keep him away from chemicals that could irritate his respiratory system this means no smoking in the house and no chemical cleaning products buy natural cleaners from the health food store keep him away from freshlycut grass and indoors as much as possible during pollen season make sure your vet uses only the most modern anesthetics such as isoflurane insist on having his heart and breathing monitored by special equipment whenever he must go under anesthesia many vets are not careful enough with shortfaced breeds how long do shih tzus live and what health problems do they have typically  years but theyre not necessarily healthy throughout
