power of imagery in content marketing  sigstr marketing the power of imagery in content marketing published by brad beutler on july   back to blog a picture is worth a thousand words so the saying goes while us marketers love a good infographic or chart the saying holds true in almost every context in a recent article on jeffbullascom author savannah louie says “words aren’t enough any more” and we agree with her in fact  pieces of content are shared each day according to an aol  nielsen content sharing study wow that’s a ton of content consumers have access to view how do they decide what to dig into and what to skip as marketers we need to be increasingly more and more intentional about standing out from the crowd while words can be incredibly powerful we need to capture the attention of our followers in new graphiccentric ways that give us an edge the article authored by savannah goes on to say that “with the increase of photo video infographics and screenshots – today’s marketers are discovering the power behind imagery in content marketing” why images are king in content “communication coupled with imagery – photographs or video – is easier to process and more entertaining than words on a blank canvas” says savannah forbes insight reports that nearly  of senior executives prefer to watch video instead of reading text if both are available on the same page still skeptical check out these interesting stats from an inc article the average person gets distracted in  seconds though a mere  seconds is enough to distract some people people form a first impression in a mere  milliseconds an estimated  percent of communications will be visual by  an estimated  percent of internet traffic will be video content by  posts that include images produce  percent higher engagement than textonly posts people are  percent more likely to buy a product after viewing a product video posts with videos attract x more links than textonly posts an infographic in adweek shared that “people remember  of what they see or do versus  of what they read imagery in content marketing is a “must” if marketers want to make a lasting impression on consumers”  tips to creating powerful visual content in savannah’s article she points out  tips to make content more powerful using visuals  pick the right type of content “stock photos may be an easy way to add a visual element to a blog post but there are better ways to execute visual marketing” said savannah “adding an infographic or a short video outlining key points can make content much more meaningful to the consumer” “however if your hands are tied and you’re at a loss for original images using a relevant stock photo is better than completely foregoing a visual element reports show that  of people respond better to text coupled with visuals than plain text although stock photos may not be ideal or original these images will garner more attention than no visuals at all”  make a calltoaction savannah also shares that “visual marketing can be an asset because of its ability to inspire consumers to take action marketers should ensure that they are taking advantage of this capability by including a calltoaction cta with their visual marketing” “not all cta’s have to be obvious by drafting creative stimulating content consumers will feel compelled to share your work with others by simply providing a solid piece of imagery you can inspire your audience to advocate for you without actually having to ask”  be aware of omnichannel marketing “you can tweet the best video content with links to landing pages on your website… but if your site is not optimized for mobile this means nothing to the consumer trying to access your site from their smartphone” commented savannah “consumers should be able to access all touch points of your company without a hitch encountering an incorrectly linked landing page or receiving conflicting messages across two separate platforms can be a major turnoff for consumers ensure that you are producing seamless content with omnichannel marketing to avoid confusing or frustrating customers” the power of imagery in employee email want

constantly improving their product and they are an absolute joy to work with after  inquires about what should our signatures look like from employees around our company i knew it was time for a solution sigstr saves me time so i can focus on important marketing initiatives instead of jumping into everyones email accounts to help craft a consistent signature i think my favorite part is that
