review an easy way to buy life insurance posted on october   by john schmoll in insurance this post may contain affiliate links please read my disclosure page for more info this article was sponsored by selectquote but all thoughts and opinions are my own buying life insurance is right up there with going to the dentist we know we need it but we can think of a million things that are more fun should this hold us back from buying life insurance in a word no having worked in the life insurance industry myself i’ve seen first hand what happens to families when an earner passes unexpectedly they’re left on their own to figure out how to meet their daytoday needs not to mention their future needs as a small business owner husband and father i believe buying life insurance is one of the most important and loving things i can do if you’re in the market for life insurance this overview of selectquote will show you how many of the preconceived notions you may have about life insurance are worth rethinking how does selectquote work   years ago it was a time intensive process to buy life insurance you had to meet with a salesperson fill out a lengthy paper application and then wait to get your quote technology has greatly reduced the pain of applying for life insurance selectquote harnesses that technology to simplify the entire life insurance purchase process so you can have your quote in a matter of minutes this is how selectquote is able to provide actionable information in such a short time period selectquote does not sell their own product rather they act as a kind of automated life insurance broker selectquote works with over  reputable life insurance companies to find you the best rate possible which is great for someone who wants to pay the lowest price i went through the process of applying for life insurance myself through selectquote you go to the selectquote site and answer ten simple questions they ask for things like age weight medical background information and the level of coverage you want the process took me maybe five minutes total selectquote gives you a case number and assigns a representative to reach out to you within  hours i was called within  hours by a representative who asked a few more followup questions in total our phone conversation was roughly ten minutes and he was able to provide me quotes from a rated providers at the end of our call the lowest quote was  per month for a year  term life insurance policy which is in line with quotes i’ve received from other providers within  minutes of getting off the phone my selectquote representative emailed me three other quotes representing a variety of other coverage options i loved this as it gave me the information i needed to compare different options and decide what solution is best for my family you may wonder what type of coverage selectquote offers they offer only term life coverage i’ve covered indepth the value of term life insurance in the past and selectquote holds to the same solid principles which may be part of the reason they are the top term life insurance agency in the country selectquote offers    and year plan options and over  million in coverage so you have plenty of flexibility through selectquote going beyond life insurance   it’s easy to think that life insurance is the main type of coverage you need for your needs that’s not the case as you may need anything from auto insurance homeowner’srenters insurance or disability insurance to name a few selectquote knows this and doesn’t stop at just life insurance selectquote offers three additional types of insurance coverage those are auto insurance homeowner’s insurance medicare supplement insurance i don’t currently have need for any of those coverage options though they operate similar to life insurance through selectquote they work with only a to a carriers and find the best rates possible to help you save money the importance of life insurance   we think we’re invincible we’re not it’s easy to put off buying life insurance because we think it’s not needed or that it’s too expensive however our financial responsibility does not end when we die as a parent or spouse you have many obligations to continue to care for with your family after your passing such as paying off your house paying off any other outstanding debt college for your children retirement needs there are other needs you may need to provide for but these are among the most important life insurance helps care for those needs and provide peace of mind that your loved ones won’t have to suffer a  limra study shows that half of families would feel the financial impact of losing a primary income earner within the first year life insurance helps lessen that sting what if you’re young or single do you still need life insurance i would argue that in most cases you do not all debt dies with you and you may have other outstanding obligations then there’s the funeral the average funeral costs over  without life insurance your family is on the hook for those expenses you may think life insurance is too expensive to buy the aforementioned limra study reveals that  percent of people think life insurance is too expensive in many cases that simply isn’t true taking a look at my quote i could have  in coverage for less than  per month that’s less than a tank of gas if you’re younger than i am you can get coverage for significantly cheaper because you lock in lower rates due to your age you may think life insurance isn’t important but in many cases it’s a vital part of financial health go to selectquote today to see what kind of rates you can get   do you think life insurance is important to have why do you think so many believe life insurance is too expensive would your family be in need upon your untimely passing bufferif you enjoyed this post please consider subscribing to the rss feedthe following two tabs change content belowbiolatest posts john schmoll im the
