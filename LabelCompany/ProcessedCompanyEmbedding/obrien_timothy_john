beach police arrested obrien and on friday the yearold agent was convicted in los angeles superior court of four felonies that could send him to state prison for five yearsjudge william pounders immediately ordered obrienwho had been free on  bailto jail saying he was a flight riskjurors convicted obrien of unlawful sex with a minor oral copulation with a minor unlawful penetration of a minor and possession of methamphetamine jurors also convicted him of a sole misdemeanor count resisting arrestafter   days of deliberations however jurors were unable to reach verdicts on three other counts sodomy with a minor furnishing methamphetamine to a minor and brandishing a gundeputy dist atty richard rosenthal who in court had called obrien a predator said prosecutors would decide by the sentencing hearing set for sept  whether to seek a retrial on those three charges he declined to comment furtherjim bauer the special agent in charge of the secret services los angeles office said obrien has been suspended without pay pending an internal review and added we regret the pain he has caused his victims and his familydefense attorney jim blatt said he was disappointed by the verdicts but said it could have been worse if convicted on all counts obrien faced up to  years in prison blatt saidblatt said he spoke to jurors after the verdicts were read and they indicated to me that there were no winners in this case everyone lostobrien had been a secret service agent for six years he had been transferred to the reagan detail last year bauer saidafter he moved to los angeles

advantage of the girls position in a troubled familythe prosecutor also alleged that obrien gave the girl methamphetamineobrien was arrested dec  about a month after the affair came to light prosecutors saidthe defense alleged that the father framed obrien after a fallingout the defense further maintained that obrien never took drugsin addition the defense contended that the teenager pursued the agent not the other way aroundin mash notes that were entered into evidence the girl put paper to pen to say wonder how long i can hold out she also wrote all you do makes me crazy and im turned to liquid falling to the floor youve walked onthe teenager blatt said friday after leaving court wrote passionate love notes desired sexual relations and enjoyed them to prosecute this man when he finally gives in to this temptation i think perhaps it may be considered unfairrosenthal argued to jurors however that the notes were proof not that the girl had carried a torch for obrien but that
