flowers will bloom delightfully remove flowers from box by cutting any straps our garden roses are shipped in special packaging that may or may not include water boxes water tubes or wet foam no matter the packaging your garden roses have been properly prepared for shipping remove any of this special packaging including any plastic wrapping in order to prevent condensation which will cause rotting but do not remove the cardboard sleeve or the rubber bands holding the flowers together in a bunch fill containers with at least  inches of fresh cool water  add floral food to prevent bacteria from forming in the water and to give added nutrients to the roses if you do not have flower food it can be purchased at any local florist  remove any leaves that fall below the water line not removing the leaves may cause bacteria to form and shorten the roses life  using sharp scissors or a knife cut the stems diagonally under running water approximately one inch from each stems bottom edge  immediately after cutting place the stems in the prepared water  allow flowers at least  hours to hydrate well garden roses may take up to  hours to properly hydrate leave the plastic or cardboard packaging around the blooms for a minimum of  hours this will allow the roses sufficient time to hydrate properly keep flowers away from direct sunlight drafts or excessive heat  to keep the garden roses fresh change the water every  to  hours or when the water becomes cloudy assure that your flowers have sufficient water the flowers will drink an exceptionally large amount of water upon arrival we ship our garden roses with guard petals in order to protect the blooms during shipping upon removal of the protective packaging remove any brown or discolored guard petals it is not uncommon to remove an average of  to  petals per bloom remember that exposing garden roses to warmer environments outside a hot room etc will help the flower bloom and storing your roses in a cooler environment will slow down the opening process flower stories share your own flower story ▸ sitka july wedding by jennifer everly event date july st  my husband nick and i got married in sitka alaska
