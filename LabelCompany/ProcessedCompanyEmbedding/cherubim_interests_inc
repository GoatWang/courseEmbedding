and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business our company has generated no revenue since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate substantial earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future the continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve our operating objectives and the attainment of profitable operations as at november   our company has accumulated losses of  since inception as we do not have sufficient funds for our planned operations we will be required to raise additional funds for operations and expansion due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet

exchange act of  as amended the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods required under the secs rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer principal executive officer and chief financial officer principal financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure the companys chief executive officer who is its principal executive and chief financial officer completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and d e under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act as of the end of the period feb   covered by this form q disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures based on that evaluation the companys chief executive officer  cfo has concluded the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this form q were ineffective because of comments from the sec that required additional disclosure and restatement of other disclosed information based upon the evaluation of our controls the chief executive officercfo has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective providing reasonable assurance that material information relating to the company activity is communicated in sufficient detail although changes have been made to provide the level of detail that is required in the company filings based upon the sec comments the company is not prepared at this time to remove the ineffective status of the disclosure controls and procedures the company will continue to work in these deficiencies  changes in internal control over financial reporting  there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended november   that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting part ii  other information item  legal proceedings none item a risk factors risks and uncertainties we may be adversely affected by value of our product given it is set by world demand and beyond our control we face risks of losses in inventory value given the nature of the valuation of precious metals the value of such metals is determined by the demand for them on a global scale and is beyond our control while we do not anticipate there to be a significant decrease in the value of precious metals we cannot guarantee any such change in value there is substantial uncertainty as to whether we will continue operations if we discontinue operations you could lose your investment our auditors have discussed their uncertainty regarding our business operations in their audit report dated august   this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment we lack an operating history there is no assurance that our future operations will result in continued profitable revenues if we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably our business will fail we have very little operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success could be determined we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenues in the future failure to generate revenues will cause us to go out of business because our management does not have prior experience in mining our business has a higher risk of failure our current directors do not have experience in the mining industry as a result we may not be able to recognize and take advantage of opportunities without the aid of qualified marketing and business development consultants our directors decisions and choices may not be well thought out and our operations earnings and ultimate financial success may suffer irreparable harm as a result  our stock is a penny stock trading of our stock may be restricted by the secs penny stock regulations and the finras sales practice requirements which may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock our stock is a penny stock the securities and exchange commission has adopted rule g which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these l penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker dealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock in addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the financial industry regulatory authority has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a broker dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules the national association of securities dealers believes that there is a high probability that speculative lowpriced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers the national association of securities dealers requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock item
