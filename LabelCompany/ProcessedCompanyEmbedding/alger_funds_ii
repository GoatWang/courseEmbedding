companies to small emerging growth companies the funds benchmark is the morgan stanley capital international msci� europe australasia and far east eafe� index which is an unmanaged market capitalizationweighted index that is designed to measure the performance of publicly traded stocks issued by companies in developed markets excluding the united states and canada while the msci eafe index excludes stocks of canadian companies the fund may invest in such stocks the fund may invest up to  of its assets in securities of companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market countries although the allocation of the funds assets to emerging market countries will vary from time to time the manager seeks investment opportunities in companies with fundamental strengths that indicate the potential for sustainable growth the manager focuses on individual stock selection building the funds portfolio from the bottom up through extensive fundamental research the fund invests primarily in growth stocks the manager believes that these companies tend to fall into one of two categories � high unit volume growth vital creative companies which offer goods or services to a rapidlyexpanding marketplace they include both established and emerging firms offering new or improved products or firms simply fulfilling an increased demand for an existing line � positive life cycle change companies experiencing a major change which is expected to produce advantageous results these changes may be as varied as new management products or technologies restructuring or reorganization or merger and acquisition the fund may but is not required to use derivatives such as futures options and forward contracts as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying asset to increase returns to manage foreign currency risk or as part of a hedging strategy the fund can leverage that is borrow money to buy additional securities by borrowing money the fund has the potential to increase its returns if the increase in the value of the securities purchased exceeds the cost of borrowing including interest paid on the money borrowed risks the funds may appeal to investors who seek longterm capital appreciation while understanding that there are risks to principal associated with investing in growth equity portfolios as with any fund that invests in stocks your investment may fluctuate in value and the loss of your investment is a risk of investing a funds price per share will fluctuate due to changes in the market prices of its investments an investment in a fund may not grow as fast as the rate of inflation additionally stocks tend to be more volatile than some other investments you could make such as bonds prices of growth stocks tend to be higher in relation to their companies earnings and may be more sensitive to market political and economic developments than other stocks making their prices more volatile based on each funds investment style and objective an investment in the fund may be better suited to investors who seek longterm capital growth and can tolerate fluctuations in their investments value trading in growth stocks may be relatively shortterm meaning a fund may buy a security and sell it a short time later if it is believed that an alternative investment may provide greater future growth this activity may create higher transaction costs due to commissions and other expenses and thereby adversely affect fund performance in addition a high level of shortterm trading may increase the funds realized gains thereby increasing the amount that must be distributed to shareholders at the end of the year investing in companies of all capitalizations involves the risk that smaller issuers in which the funds invest may have limited product lines or financial resources or lack management depth the funds investments in small cap stocks are subject to the possibility that it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a security position at a time and price acceptable to a fund owing to the potentially less frequent trading of stocks of smaller market capitalization companies a funds performance will be influenced by political social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign companies special risks associated with investments in foreign companies include exposure to currency fluctuations less liquidity less developed or less efficient trading markets lack of comprehensive company information political instability and differing auditing and legal standards the securities of issuers located in emerging markets can be more volatile and less liquid than those of issuers in more mature economies investing in emerging markets involves higher levels of risk including increased currency information liquidity market political and valuation risks deficiencies in regulatory oversight market infrastructure shareholder protections and company laws could expose the fund to operational and other risks as well some countries may have restrictions that could limit the funds access to attractive opportunities additionally emerging markets often face serious economic problems such as high external debt inflation and unemployment that could subject the fund to increased volatility or substantial declines in value investments in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the us dollar or in the case of hedged positions that the us dollar will decline relative to the currency being hedged currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will reduce the value of securities held by a fund and denominated in those currencies foreign currencies also are subject to risks caused by inflation interest rates budget deficits and low savings rates political factors and government controls the use of leverage such as engaging in reverse repurchase agreements lending portfolio securities and engaging in forward commitment transactions may magnify a funds gains or losses if the manager incorrectly predicts the price movement of a security or market an option held by a fund may expire unexercised and the fund will lose the premium it paid for the option or the fund as the writer of an option may be required to purchase or sell the optioned security at a disadvantageous price or settle an index option at a loss also an imperfect correlation between a hedge and the securities hedged may render the hedge partially ineffective the funds may use derivative instruments such as options futures and options on futures including those relating to stocks indexes and foreign currencies and forward contracts a small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on a funds performance the use of derivatives involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value and there is the risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by a fund will not correlate with the underlying instruments or the funds other investments derivative instruments also involve the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the derivative instruments to make required payments or otherwise comply with the derivative instruments terms performance as each of the funds are new past performance

options a call option on a security gives the purchaser of the option the right in return for a premium paid to buy from the writer seller of the call option the security underlying the option at a specified exercise price at any time during the term of the option the writer is obligated upon exercise of the option to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise price a put option on a security gives the holder of the option in return for the premium paid the right to sell the underlying security to the writer seller at a specified price during the term of the option the writer who receives the premium is obligated upon exercise of the option to buy the underlying security at the exercise price an option on a stock index gives the holder the right to receive a cash settlement during the term of the option based on the amount if any by which the exercise price exceeds if the option is a put or is exceeded by if the option is a call the current value of the index which is itself a function of the market values of the securities included in the index the writer of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount a fund may purchase a put option on a portfolio security to seek to protect against a decline in the market value of the security or if the fund contemplates purchasing a security in the future purchase a call option on the security in anticipation of an increase in the securitys market value when a fund writes an option if the market value of the underlying security does not move to a level that would make exercise of the option profitable to its holder the option generally will expire unexercised and the fund will realize as profit the premium it received when a call option written by a fund is exercised the fund will be required to sell the underlying securities to the holder at the exercise price and will not participate in any increase in the securities value above that price when a put option written by a fund is exercised the fund will be required to purchase the underlying securities at a price in excess of their market value use of options on securities indexes entails the risk that trading in the options may be interrupted if trading in certain securities included in the index is interrupted price movements in a funds portfolio securities may not correlate precisely with movements in the level of an index and therefore the use of options on indexes cannot serve as a complete hedge and would depend in part on the ability of the manager to predict correctly movements in the direction of a particular market or of the stock market generally because options on indexes require settlement in cash a fund might be forced to liquidate portfolio securities to meet settlement

equivalents such as commercial paper or money market instruments for temporary defensive reasons this is to attempt to protect the funds assets from a temporary unacceptable risk of loss rather than directly to promote the funds investment objective a fund also may hold these types of securities pending the investment of proceeds from the sale of fund shares or portfolio securities or to meet

the manager under procedures adopted by the board of trustees in determining whether market quotations are reliable and readily available the manager monitors information it routinely receives for significant events it believes will affect market prices of portfolio instruments held by the funds significant events may affect a particular company for example a trading halt in the companys securities on an exchange during the day or may affect securities markets for example a natural disaster that causes a market to close if the manager is aware of a significant event that has occurred after the close of the market where a portfolio instrument is primarily traded but before the close of the new york stock exchange that the manager believes has affected or is likely to affect the

public is not an acceptable substitute market timing policies and procedures the funds invests predominantly in ustraded highly liquid securities for which current new york marketclosing prices are readily available on a daily basis at the time the funds price their portfolios and determine nav per share as a result the manager believes that there is little incentive for investors to engage in frequent andor shortterm trading often referred to as markettiming to benefit from stale pricing nonetheless the funds recognize that in certain circumstances active inandout trading by fund shareholders for whatever reason implemented may be attempted and may if carried out on a large scale impose burdens on a funds portfolio management team interfere with the efficient management of the fund increase the funds transaction costs administrative costs or tax liability or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the fund and its other shareholders the funds therefore discourage market timing and to the extent possible monitors for market timing patterns in the funds the board of trustees has determined that the funds may reject purchase orders on a temporary or permanent basis from investors that the manager is able to determine in its reasonable business judgment are exhibiting a pattern of frequent or shortterm trading in fund shares or shares of other funds sponsored by the manager that is detrimental to the fund involved in order to detect significant market timing the manager will among other things monitor overall subscription redemption and exchange activity isolate significant daily activity and significant activity relative to existing account sizes to determine if there appears to be market timing activity in an individual portfolio while the fund might not be able to detect frequent or shortterm trading conducted by the underlying owners of shares held in omnibus accounts or placed through market intermediaries other than on a fullydisclosed basis and therefore might not be able to effectively prevent frequent or shortterm trading in those accounts the manager attempts to monitor these activities in omnibus accounts and will contract with brokerdealers that sell shares of the funds and entities that hold omnibus accounts with its mutual funds to seek to discourage detect and prevent market timing and active trading there is no guarantee that a funds efforts to identify investors who engage in excessive trading activity or to curtail that activity will be successful in addition the funds policies against market timing and active trading may in some cases interfere with or delay implementation of legitimate investment decisions made by shareholders seeking to purchase or redeem shares disclosure of portfolio holdings the board of trustees has adopted policies and procedures relating to disclosure of each funds portfolio securities these policies and procedures recognize that there may be legitimate business reasons for holdings to be disclosed and seek to balance those interests to protect the proprietary nature of the trading strategies and implementation thereof by the funds generally the policies prohibit the release of information concerning portfolio holdings which have not previously been made public to individual investors institutional investors intermediaries that distribute the funds shares and other parties which are not employed by the manager or its affiliates except when the legitimate business purposes for selective disclosure and other conditions designed to protect the funds are acceptable the funds make their full holdings available semiannually in shareholder reports filed on form ncsr and after the first and third fiscal quarters in regulatory filings on form nq these shareholder reports and regulatory filings are filed with the sec as required by federal securities laws and are generally available within sixty  days of the end of the funds fiscal quarter in addition the funds make publicly available their monthend top  holdings with a  day lag and their monthend full portfolios with a  day lag on their website wwwspectrafundscom and through other marketing communications including printed advertisingsales literature andor shareholder telephone customer service centers no compensation or other consideration is received for the nonpublic disclosure of portfolio holdings information in accordance with the foregoing the funds provide portfolio holdings information to service providers who provide necessary or beneficial services when such service providers need access to this information in the performance of their services and are subject to duties of confidentiality  imposed by law including a duty not to trade on nonpublic information andor  pursuant to an agreement that confidential information is not to be disclosed or used including trading on such information other than as required by law from time to time the funds will communicate with these service providers to confirm that they understand the funds policies and procedures regarding such disclosure this agreement must be approved by the i managers legal and

purposes in equity securities the fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization from larger wellestablished companies to small emerging growth companies the funds benchmark is the russell � growth index which is an index of common stocks designed to track performance of companies with greater than average growth orientation in general the fund may invest up to  of its assets in securities of companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market countries although the allocation of the funds assets to emerging market countries will vary from time to time spectra international opportunities fund under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities including common stocks american depositary receipts and global depositary receipts of foreign companies the fund generally invests in at least three foreign countries and at times may invest a substantial portion of its assets in a single foreign country the fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization from larger wellestablished companies to small emerging growth companies the fund may invest up to  of its assets in securities of companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market countries although the allocation of the funds assets to emerging market countries will vary from time to time in general each fund like all other investments can provide two types of return income return and capital return income return is the income received from an investment such as interest on bonds and money market instruments and dividends from common and preferred stocks capital return is the change in the market value of an investment such as an increase in the price of a common stock or of shares of a fund total return is the sum of income return and capital return thus if a fund over a year produces four percent in income return and its shares increase in value by three percent its total return is seven percent in general the more capital return is emphasized over income return in an investment program the more risk is associated with the program growth funds such as the funds seek primarily capital return they invest primarily in common stocks and offer the opportunity of the greatest return over the long term but can be risky since their prices fluctuate with changes in stock market prices growth funds that invest in companies with smaller market capitalizations offer potential for significant price gains if the companies are successful but there is also the risk that the companies will not succeed and the price of the companies shares will drop in value growth funds that invest in larger more established companies generally offer relatively less opportunity for capital return but a greater degree of safety investors considering equity investing through the funds should carefully consider the inherent risks associated with an investment in each fund expectations of future inflation rates should be considered in making investment decisions and even though over the long term stocks may present attractive opportunities the results of an equity investment managed by a particular management firm may not match those of the market as a whole each fund may but is not required to use derivatives such as futures options and forward contracts as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying asset to increase returns to manage foreign currency risk or as part of a hedging strategy each fund may borrow only from banks and may not borrow in excess of onethird of the market value of its total assets less liabilities other than such borrowing these practices are deemed to be speculative and may cause a funds net asset value be more volatile than the net asset value of a fund that does not engage in these activities investment strategies and policies the prospectus discusses the investment objective of each fund and the principal strategies employed to achieve this objective this section contains supplemental information concerning the types of securities and other instruments in which the funds may invest the investment policies and portfolio strategies that the funds may utilize and certain risks attendant on those investments policies and strategies in general each fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in equity securities such as common or preferred stocks or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities including warrants and rights the funds will invest primarily in companies whose securities are traded on domestic stock exchanges or in the overthecounter market these companies may be in the developmental stage may be older companies that appear to be entering a new stage of growth progress owing to factors such as management changes or development of new technology products or markets or may be companies providing products or services with a high unitvolume growth rate in order to afford the funds the flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities for investments in accordance with its investment objectives and to meet redemptions each fund may hold up to  of its net assets in money market instruments and repurchase agreements and in excess of that amount up to  of its assets during temporary defensive periods this amount may be higher than that maintained by other funds with similar investment objectives there is no guarantee that a funds objective will be achieved common and preferred stocks stocks represent shares of ownership in a company generally preferred stock has a specified dividend and ranks after bonds and before common stocks in its claim on income for dividend payments and on assets should the company be liquidated after other claims are satisfied common stockholders participate in company profits on a prorata basis profits may be paid out in dividends or reinvested in the company to help it grow increases and decreases in earnings are usually reflected in a company�s stock price so common stocks generally have the greatest appreciation and depreciation potential of all corporate securities while most preferred stocks pay a dividend each fund may purchase preferred stock where the issuer has omitted or is in danger of omitting payment of its dividend such investments would be made primarily for their capital appreciation potential each fund may purchase trust preferred securities which are preferred stocks issued by a special purpose trust subsidiary backed by subordinated debt of the corporate parent these securities typically bear a market rate coupon comparable to interest rates available on debt of a similarly rated company holders of the trust preferred securities have limited voting rights to control the activities of the trust and no voting rights with respect to the parent company temporary defensive and interim investments when market conditions are unstable or the funds investment adviser fred alger management inc alger management or the manager believes it is otherwise appropriate to reduce holdings in stocks the fund can invest in a variety of debt securities for defensive purposes the funds also can purchase these securities for liquidity purposes to meet cash needs due to the redemption of fund shares or to hold while waiting to reinvest cash received from the sale of other portfolio securities each fund can buy � highquality shortterm money market instruments including those issued by the us treasury or other government agencies � commercial paper shortterm unsecured promissory notes of domestic or foreign companies � shortterm debt obligations of corporate issuers certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances of domestic and foreign banks and savings and loan associations and � repurchase agreements shortterm debt securities would normally be selected for defensive or cash management purposes because they can normally be disposed of quickly are not generally subject to significant fluctuations in principal value and their value will be less subject to interest rate risk than longerterm debt securities bank obligations these are certificates of deposit bankers acceptances and other shortterm debt obligations certificates of deposit are shortterm obligations of commercial banks a bankers acceptance is a time draft drawn on a commercial bank by a borrower usually in connection with international commercial transactions certificates of deposit may have fixed or variable rates a fund will not invest in any debt security issued by a commercial bank unless i the bank has total assets of at least  billion or the equivalent in other currencies or in the case of domestic banks that do not have total assets of at least  billion the aggregate investment made in any one such bank is limited to  and the principal amount of such investment is insured in full by the federal deposit insurance corporation ii in the case of us banks it is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation and iii in the case of foreign banks the security is in the opinion of the manager of an investment quality comparable to other debt securities which may be purchased by the fund these limitations do not prohibit investments in securities issued by foreign branches of us banks provided such us banks meet the foregoing requirements foreign bank obligations investments by a fund in foreign bank obligations and obligations of foreign branches of domestic banks present certain risks including the impact of future political and economic developments the possible imposition of withholding taxes on interest income the possible seizure or nationalization of foreign deposits the possible establishment of exchange controls andor the addition of other foreign governmental restrictions that might affect adversely the payment of principal and interest on these obligations in addition there may be less publicly available and reliable information about a foreign bank than about domestic banks owing to different accounting auditing reporting and recordkeeping standards in view of these risks alger management will carefully evaluate these investments on a casebycase basis shortterm corporate debt securities these are outstanding nonconvertible corporate debt securities eg bonds and debentures which have one year or less remaining to maturity corporate notes may have fixed variable or floating rates commercial paper these are shortterm promissory notes issued by corporations primarily to finance shortterm credit needs the commercial paper purchased by a fund may consist of us dollardenominated obligations of domestic issuers and foreign currencydenominated obligations of domestic or foreign issuers because these obligations are direct lending arrangements between the lender and the borrower it is not contemplated that such instruments generally will be traded and there generally is no established secondary market for these obligations although they are redeemable at face value plus accrued interest at any time accordingly where these obligations are not secured by letters of credit or other credit support arrangements a funds right to redeem is dependent on the ability of the borrower to pay principal and interest on demand convertible securities each fund may invest in convertible securities which are debt instruments or preferred stocks that make fixed dividend or interest payments and are convertible into common stock generally the market prices of convertible securities tend to reflect price changes in their underlying common stocks but also tend to respond inversely to changes in interest rates convertible securities typically entail less market risk than investments in the common stock of the same issuers declines in their market prices are typically not as pronounced as those of their underlying common stocks like all fixedincome securities convertible securities are subject to the risk of default on their issuers payment obligations variable rate master demand notes these are unsecured instruments that permit the indebtedness thereunder to vary and provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate because these notes are direct lending arrangements between a fund and an issuer they are not normally traded although no active secondary market may exist for these notes a fund may demand payment of principal and accrued interest at any time or may resell the note to a third party while the notes are not typically rated by credit rating agencies issuers of variable rate master demand notes must satisfy alger management that the same criteria for issuers of commercial paper are met in addition when purchasing variable rate master demand notes alger management will consider the earning power cash flows and other liquidity ratios of the issuers of the notes and will continuously monitor their financial status and ability to meet payment on demand in the event an issuer of a variable rate master demand note were to default on its payment obligations a fund might be unable to dispose of the note because of the absence of a secondary market and could for this or other reasons suffer a loss to the extent of the default us government obligations each fund may invest in us government securities which include treasury bills treasury notes and treasury bonds that differ in their interest rates maturities and times of issuance treasury bills have initial maturities of one year or less treasury notes have initial maturities of one to ten years and treasury bonds generally have initial maturities of greater than ten years in addition to us treasury securities each fund may invest in securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities some obligations issued or guaranteed by us government agencies and instrumentalities are supported by the full faith and credit of the us treasury others by the right of the issuer to borrow from the treasury others by discretionary authority of the us government to purchase certain obligations of the agency or instrumentality and others only by the credit of the agency or instrumentality these securities bear fixed floating or variable rates of interest while the us government currently provides financial support to such us governmentsponsored agencies or instrumentalities no assurance can be given that it will always do so since it is not so obligated by law lending of portfolio securities in order to generate income and to offset expenses each fund may lend portfolio securities to brokers dealers and other financial organizations loans of securities by a fund if and when made may not exceed  percent of the funds total assets including all collateral on such loans less liabilities exclusive of the obligation to return such collateral and will be collateralized by cash letters of credit or us government securities that are maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least  of the current market value of the loaned securities each fund has the authority to lend securities to brokers dealers and other financial organizations a fund will not lend securities to alger management or its affiliates by lending its securities a fund can increase its income by continuing to receive interest or dividends on the loaned securities as well as either investing the cash collateral in shortterm securities or by earning income in the form of interest paid by the borrower when us government securities are used as collateral the funds will adhere to the following conditions whenever their securities are lent a the fund must receive at least  cash collateral or equivalent securities from the borrower b the borrower must increase this collateral whenever the market value of the securities including accrued interest exceeds the value of the collateral c the fund must be able to terminate the loan at any time d the fund must receive reasonable interest on the loan as well as any dividends interest or other distributions on the lent securities and any increase in market value e the fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees in connection with the loan and f voting rights on the lent securities may pass to the borrower provided however that if a material event adversely affecting the investment occurs the trusts board of trustees must terminate the loan and regain the right to vote the securities a fund bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to a stock loan transaction defaults on its obligations and the fund is delayed in or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the collateral securities during the period in which the fund seeks to assert these rights the risk of incurring expenses associated with asserting these rights and the risk of losing all or a part of the income from the transaction repurchase agreements each fund may engage in repurchase agreement transactions with banks registered brokerdealers and government securities dealers approved by the board of trustees under the terms of a repurchase agreement a fund would acquire a high quality money market instrument for a relatively short period usually not more than one week subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase and the fund to resell the instrument at an agreed price including accrued interest and time thereby determining the yield during the funds holding period thus repurchase agreements may be seen to be loans by the fund collateralized by the underlying instrument this arrangement results in a fixed rate of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the funds holding period and not necessarily related to the rate of return on the underlying instrument the value of the underlying securities including accrued interest will be at least equal at all times to the total amount of the repurchase obligation including interest the fund bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and the fund is delayed in or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral securities including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the underlying securities during the period in which the fund seeks to assert these rights the risk of incurring expenses associated with asserting these rights and the risk of losing all or a part of the income from the agreement alger management acting under the supervision of the trusts board of trustees reviews the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which the funds enter into repurchase agreements to evaluate these risks and monitors on an ongoing basis the value of the securities subject to repurchase agreements to ensure that the value is maintained at the required level warrants and rights each fund may invest in warrants and rights a warrant is a type of security that entitles the holder to buy a proportionate amount of common stock at a specified price usually higher than the market price at the time of issuance for a period of years or to perpetuity in contrast rights which also represent the right to buy common shares normally have a subscription price lower than the current market value of the common stock and a life of two to four weeks warrants are freely transferable and are traded on the major securities exchanges illiquid and restricted securities each fund may invest in restricted securities ie securities which are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on their resale these restrictions might prevent the sale of the securities at a time when a sale would otherwise be desirable in order to sell securities that are not registered under the federal securities laws it may be necessary for a fund to bear the expense of registration no restricted securities will be acquired if the acquisition would cause the aggregate value of all illiquid securities to exceed  of a funds net assets each fund may invest in restricted securities governed by rule a rule a under the securities act of  as amended the securities act in adopting rule a the securities and exchange commission the sec specifically stated that restricted securities traded under rule a may be treated as liquid for purposes of investment limitations if the board of trustees or the funds adviser acting subject to the boards supervision determines that the securities are in fact liquid the trusts board of trustees has delegated its responsibility to alger management to determine the liquidity of each restricted security purchased by a fund pursuant to rule a subject to the boards oversight and review examples of factors that will be taken into account in evaluating the liquidity of a rule a security both with respect to the initial purchase and on an ongoing basis will include among others  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades eg the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer if institutional trading in restricted securities were to decline to limited levels the liquidity of a fund could be adversely affected a fund will not invest more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities which include restricted securities securities for which there is no readily available market and repurchase agreements with maturities of greater than seven days however restricted securities that are determined by the board of trustees to be liquid are not subject to this limitation rule a is designed to facilitate efficient trading of unregistered securities among institutional investors rule a permits the resale to qualified institutions of restricted securities that when issued were not of the same class as securities listed on a us securities exchange or quoted on nasdaq short sales each fund may sell securities short against the box while a short sale is the sale of a security a fund does not own it is against the box if at all times when the short position is open the fund owns an equal amount of the securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable without further consideration for securities of the same issue as the securities sold short foreign securities each fund may invest without limit in foreign securities not including american depositary receipts american depositary shares or us dollardenominated securities of foreign issuers foreign securities investments may be affected by changes in currency rates or exchange control regulations changes in governmental administration or economic or monetary policy in the united states and abroad or changed circumstances in dealing between nations dividends paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes that may decrease the net return on these investments as compared to dividends paid to a fund by domestic corporations it should be noted that there may be less publicly available information about foreign issuers than about domestic issuers and foreign issuers are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements comparable to those of domestic issuers securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers and foreign brokerage commissions are generally higher than in the united states foreign securities markets may also be less liquid more volatile and less subject to government supervision than those in the united states investments in foreign countries could be affected by other factors not present in the united states including expropriation confiscatory taxation and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations securities purchased on foreign exchanges may be held in custody by a foreign branch of a domestic bank the risks associated with investing in foreign securities are often heightened for investments in emerging markets countries these heightened risks include i greater risks of expropriation confiscatory taxation nationalization and less social political and economic stability ii the small size of the markets for securities of emerging markets issuers and the currently low or nonexistent volume of trading resulting in lack of liquidity and in price volatility iii certain national policies which may restrict the funds investment opportunities including restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests and iv the absence of developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment and private property a funds purchase and sale of portfolio securities in certain emerging markets countries may be constrained by limitations as to daily changes in the prices of listed securities periodic trading or settlement volume andor limitations on aggregate holdings of foreign investors in certain cases such limitations may be computed based upon the aggregate trading by or holdings of the fund alger management and its affiliates and its clients and other service providers the fund may not be able to sell securities in circumstances where price trading or settlement volume limitations have been reached these limitations may have a negative impact on a funds performance and may adversely affect the liquidity of the funds investment to the extent that it invests in certain emerging market countries in addition some emerging markets countries may have fixed or managed currencies which are not freefloating against the us dollar further certain emerging markets countries currencies may not be internationally traded certain of these currencies have experienced a steady devaluation relative to the us dollar if a fund does not hedge the us dollar value of securities it owns denominated in currencies that are devalued the funds net asset value will be adversely affected many emerging markets countries have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation for many years inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of certain of these countries each fund may invest in the securities of foreign issuers in the form of american depositary receipts and american depositary shares collectively adrs and global depositary receipts and global depositary shares collectively gdrs and other forms of depositary receipts these securities may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted adrs are receipts typically issued by a united states bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation gdrs are receipts issued outside the united states typically by nonunited states banks and trust companies that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic securities generally adrs in registered form are designed for use in the united states securities markets and gdrs in bearer form are designed for use outside the united states these securities may be purchased through sponsored or unsponsored facilities a sponsored facility is established jointly by the issuer of the underlying security and a depositary a depositary may establish an unsponsored facility without participation by the issuer of the deposited security holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all the costs of such facilities and the depositary of an unsponsored facility frequently is under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through voting rights to the holders of such receipts in respect of the deposited securities derivative transactions each fund may invest in or enter into derivatives for a variety of reasons including to hedge certain market or interest rate risks to provide a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities or to increase potential returns generally derivatives are financial contracts whose value depends upon or is derived from the value of an underlying asset reference rate or index and may relate to stocks bonds interest rates currencies or currency exchange rates and related indexes examples of derivative instruments the funds may use include options contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts derivatives may provide a cheaper quicker or more specifically focused way for the fund to invest than traditional securities would alger management however may decide not to employ some or all of these strategies for a fund and there is no assurance that any derivatives strategy used by the fund will succeed derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk depending upon the characteristics of the particular derivative and the portfolio as a whole derivatives permit a fund to increase or decrease the level of risk or change the character of the risk to which its portfolio is exposed in much the same way as the fund can increase or decrease the level of risk or change the character of the risk of its portfolio by making investments in specific securities however derivatives may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest meaning that a small investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact on a funds performance if a fund invests in derivatives at inopportune times or judges market conditions incorrectly such investments may lower the funds return or result in a loss a fund also could experience losses if its derivatives were poorly correlated with the underlying instruments or the funds other investments or if the fund were unable to liquidate its position because of an illiquid secondary market the market for many derivatives is or suddenly can become illiquid changes in liquidity may result in significant rapid and unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives derivatives may be purchased on established exchanges or through privately negotiated transactions referred to as overthecounter derivatives exchangetraded derivatives generally are guaranteed by the clearing agency that is the issuer or counterparty to such derivatives this guarantee usually is supported by a daily variation margin system operated by the clearing agency in order to reduce overall credit risk as a result unless the clearing agency defaults there is relatively little counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives purchased on an exchange in contrast no clearing agency guarantees overthecounter derivatives therefore each party to an overthecounter derivative bears the risk that the counterparty will default accordingly alger management will consider the creditworthiness of counterparties to overthecounter derivatives in the same manner as it would review the credit quality of a security to be purchased by a fund overthecounter derivatives are less liquid than exchangetraded derivatives since the other party to the transaction may be the only investor with sufficient understanding of the derivative to be interested in bidding for it some derivatives the funds use involve leverage eg an instrument linked to the value of a securities index may return income calculated as a multiple of the price movement of the underlying index this economic leverage will increase the volatility of these instruments as they may increase or decrease in value more quickly than the underlying security index futures contract currency or other economic variable pursuant to regulations andor published positions of the sec a fund may be required to segregate permissible liquid assets or engage in other measures approved by the sec or its staff to cover the funds obligations relating to its transactions in derivatives for example in the case of futures contracts or forward contracts that are not contractually required to cash settle a fund must set aside liquid assets equal to such contracts full notional value generally the total numerical value of the asset underlying a future or forward contract at the time of valuation while the positions are open with respect to futures contracts or forward contracts that are contractually required to cash settle however the fund is permitted to set aside liquid assets in an amount equal to the funds daily markedtomarket net obligation ie the funds daily net liability under the contracts if any rather than such contracts full notional value by setting aside assets equal to only its net obligations under cashsettled futures and forwards contracts a fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the fund were required to segregate assets equal to the full notional value of such contracts neither the trust nor the funds will be a commodity pool the trust has filed notice with the commodity futures trading commission and national futures association of its eligibility as a registered investment company for an exclusion from the definition of commodity pool operator and that neither the trust nor the funds is subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under the commodity exchange act futures transactions�in general a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a security for a set price on a future date these contracts are traded on exchanges so that in most cases either party can close out its position on the exchange for cash without delivering the security an option on a futures contract gives the holder of the option the right to buy from or sell to the writer of the option a position in a futures contract at a specified price on or before a specified expiration date although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities generally these obligations are closed out before delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts same exchange underlying security or index and delivery month closing out a futures contract sale is effected by purchasing a futures contract for the same aggregate amount of the specific type of financial instrument with the same delivery date if an offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale price the fund realizes a capital gain or if it is more the fund realizes a capital loss conversely if an offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price the fund realizes a capital gain or if it is less the fund realizes a capital loss transaction costs also are included in these calculations each fund may enter into futures contracts in us domestic markets or on exchanges located outside the united states foreign markets may offer advantages such as trading opportunities or arbitrage possibilities not available in the united states foreign markets however may have greater risk potential than domestic markets for example some foreign exchanges are principal markets so that no common clearing facility exists and an investor may look only to the broker for performance of the contract in addition any profits that a fund might realize in trading could be eliminated by adverse changes in the currency exchange rate or the fund could incur losses as a result of those changes engaging in these transactions involves risk of loss to a fund which could adversely affect the value of the funds net assets although each fund intends to purchase or sell futures contracts only if there is an active market for such contracts no assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular contract at any particular time many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the trading day futures contract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting the fund to substantial losses successful use of futures by a fund also is subject to alger managements ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the relevant market and to the extent the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes to ascertain the appropriate correlation between the securities being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract for example if a fund uses futures to hedge against the possibility of a decline in the market value of securities held in its portfolio and the prices of such securities instead increase the fund will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value of securities which it has hedged because it will have offsetting losses in its futures positions furthermore if in such circumstances the fund has insufficient cash it may have to sell securities to meet daily variation margin requirements the fund may have to sell such securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so specific futures transactions each fund may invest in futures contracts and options on futures contracts including those with respect to securities indexes interest rates and currencies each fund may purchase and sell index futures contracts and options thereon an index future obligates the fund to pay or receive an amount of cash equal to a fixed dollar amount specified in the futures contract multiplied by the difference between the settlement price of the contract on the contracts last trading day and the value of the index based on the prices of the securities that comprise the index at the opening of trading in such securities on the next business day each fund may purchase and sell interest rate futures contracts and options thereon an interest rate future obligates the fund to purchase or sell an amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price each fund may purchase and sell currency futures and options thereon a foreign currency future obligates the fund to purchase or sell an amount of a specific currency at a future date at a specific price options each fund may purchase or sell that is write listed options on securities as a means of achieving additional return or of hedging the value of its portfolio a fund may write covered call options on common stocks that it owns or has an immediate right to acquire through conversion or exchange of other securities in an amount not to exceed  of total assets the funds may only buy or sell options that are listed on a national securities exchange if a fund has written an option it may terminate its obligation by effecting a closing purchase transaction this is accomplished by purchasing an option of the same series as the option previously written there can be no assurance that a closing purchase transaction can be effected when the fund so desires an option may be closed out only on an exchange that provides a secondary market for an option of the same series although a fund will generally not purchase or write options that appear to lack an active secondary market there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any particular option in such event it might not be possible to effect closing transactions in particular options so that a fund would have to exercise its option in order to realize any profit and would incur brokerage commissions upon the exercise of the options if a fund as a covered call option writer were unable to effect a closing purchase transaction in a secondary market it would not be able to sell the underlying security until the option expired or it delivers the underlying security upon exercise or otherwise covers the position a fund will not purchase options if as a result the aggregate cost of all outstanding options exceeds  of the funds total assets although no more than  will be committed to transactions entered into for nonhedging purposes a call option written by a fund is covered if the fund owns the underlying security covered by the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration or for additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its custodian upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio a call option is also covered if the fund holds a call on the same security as the call written where the exercise price of the call held is  equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or  greater than the exercise price of the call written if the difference is maintained by the fund in cash us government securities or other highgrade shortterm obligations in a segregated account held with its custodian a put option is covered if the fund maintains cash or other highgrade shortterm obligations with a value equal to the exercise price in a segregated account held with its custodian or else holds a put on the same security as the put written where the exercise price of the put held is equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put written if a fund has written an option it may terminate its obligation by effecting a closing purchase transaction this is accomplished by purchasing an option of the same series as the option previously written however once a fund has been assigned an exercise notice the fund will be unable to effect a closing purchase transaction similarly if a fund is the holder of an option it may liquidate its position by effecting a closing sale transaction this is accomplished by selling an option of the same series as the option previously purchased there can be no assurance that either a closing purchase or sale transaction can be effected when a fund so desires a fund will realize a profit from a closing transaction if the price of the transaction is less than the premium received from writing the option or is more than the premium paid to purchase the option the fund will realize a loss from a closing transaction if the price of the transaction is more than the premium received from writing the option or less than the premium paid to purchase the option because call option prices generally reflect increases in the price of the underlying security any loss resulting from the repurchase of a call option may also be wholly or partially offset by unrealized appreciation of the underlying security other principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand interest rates the current market price and price volatility of the underlying security and the time remaining until the expiration date in addition to options on securities a fund may also purchase and sell call and put options on securities indexes a securities index reflects in a single number the market value of many different securities relative values are assigned to the securities included in an index and the index fluctuates with changes in the market values of the securities the options give the holder the right to receive a cash settlement during the term of the option based on the difference between the exercise price and the value of the index by writing a put or call option on a securities index a fund is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount a fund may offset its position in index options prior to expiration by entering into a closing transaction on an exchange or it may let the option expire unexercised options on securities indexes are similar to options on specific securities however because options on securities indexes do not involve the delivery of an underlying security the option represents the holders right to obtain from the writer cash in an amount equal to a fixed multiple of the amount by which the exercise price exceeds in the case of a put or is less than in the case of a call the closing value of the underlying securities index on the exercise date therefore while one purpose of writing such options is to generate additional income for a fund the fund recognizes that it may be required to deliver an amount of cash in excess of the market value of a securities index at such time as an option written by the fund is exercised by the holder use of options on securities indexes entails the risk that trading in the options may be interrupted if trading in certain securities included in the index is interrupted the funds will not purchase these options unless alger management is satisfied with the development depth and liquidity of the market and alger management believes the options can be closed out price movements in a funds securities may not correlate precisely with movements in the level of an index and therefore the use of options on indexes cannot serve as a complete hedge and would depend in part on the ability of alger management to predict correctly movements in the direction of the market generally or of a particular industry because options on securities indexes require settlement in cash alger management might be forced to liquidate portfolio securities to meet settlement obligations although alger management will attempt to take appropriate measures to minimize the risks relating to any trading by a fund in put and call options there can be no assurance that the fund will succeed in any optiontrading program it undertakes foreign currency transactions each fund may enter into foreign currency transactions for a variety of purposes including to fix in us dollars between trade and settlement date the value of a security the fund has agreed to buy or sell to hedge the us dollar value of securities the fund already owns particularly if it expects a decrease in the value of the currency in which the foreign security is denominated or to gain or reduce exposure to the foreign currency for investment purposes the currency exposure of the funds portfolio typically will be unhedged to the us dollar foreign currency transactions may involve for example a funds purchase of foreign currencies for us dollars or the maintenance of short positions in foreign currencies a short position would involve the fund agreeing to exchange an amount of a currency it did not currently own for another currency at a future date in anticipation of a decline in the value of the currency sold relative to the currency the fund contracted to receive a funds success in these transactions may depend on the ability of alger management to predict accurately the future exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time they generally are determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets and the relative merits of investments in different countries actual or perceived changes in interest rates and other complex factors as seen from an international perspective currency exchange rates also can be affected unpredictably by intervention or failure to intervene by us or foreign governments or central banks or by currency controls or political developments in the united states or abroad swap transactions each fund may engage in swap transactions including currency swaps index swaps and interest rate swaps a fund may enter into swaps for both hedging purposes and to seek to increase total return a fund also may enter into options on swap agreements sometimes called swaptions swap agreements are two party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than one year in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of return earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments the gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount ie the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate in a particular foreign currency or in a basket of swaps or securities representing a particular index the notional amount of the swap agreement is only used as a basis upon which to calculate the obligations that the parties to a swap agreement have agreed to exchange most swap agreements entered into by the funds are cash settled and calculate the obligations of the parties to the agreement on a net basis thus a funds current obligations or rights under a swap agreement generally will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement the net amount a funds current obligations under a swap agreement will be accrued daily offset against any amounts owed to the fund and any accrued but unpaid net amounts owed to a swap counterparty will be covered by the segregation of permissible liquid assets of the fund a swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right but not the obligation in return for payment of a premium to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten extend cancel or otherwise modify an existing swap agreement at some designated future time on specified terms a cashsettled option on a swap gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the underlying swap as of the exercise date these options typically are purchased in privately negotiated transactions from financial institutions including securities brokerage firms depending on the terms of the particular option agreement a fund generally will incur a greater degree of risk when it writes a swap option than it will incur when it purchases a swap option when a fund purchases a swap option it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid should it decide to let the option expire unexercised however when a fund writes a swap option upon exercise of the option the fund will become obligated according to the terms of the underlying agreement the use of swap agreements is a highly specialized activity which involves strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions if alger management is incorrect in its forecasts of applicable market factors or a counterparty defaults the investment performance of the fund would diminish compared with what it would have been if these techniques were not used in addition it is possible that developments in the swap market including potential government regulation could adversely affect the funds ability to terminate existing swap agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements a fund will enter into swap agreements only when alger management believe it would be in the best interests of the fund to do so in addition a fund will enter into swap agreements only with counterparties that meet certain standards of creditworthiness generally such counterparties would have to be eligible counterparties under the terms of the funds repurchase agreement guidelines combined transactions each fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions structured notes and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of alger management it is in the best interests of the fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on alger managements judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective future developments each fund may take advantage of opportunities in options and futures contracts and options on futures contracts and any other derivatives which are not presently contemplated for use by the fund or which are not currently available but which may be developed to the extent such opportunities are both consistent with the funds investment objective and legally permissible for the fund before a fund enters into such transactions or makes any such investment the fund will provide appropriate disclosure in its prospectus or this sai borrowing each fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes the investment company act of  as amended the  act requires a fund to maintain continuous asset coverage that is total assets including borrowings less liabilities exclusive of borrowings of  of the amount borrowed if such asset coverage should decline below  as a result of market fluctuations or other reasons the fund may be required to sell some of its portfolio holdings within three days to reduce the debt and restore the  asset coverage even though it may be disadvantageous from an investment standpoint to sell securities at that time the fund also may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with such borrowing or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest rate investment restrictions the investment restrictions below have been adopted by the trust with respect to the funds as fundamental policies under the  act a fundamental policy may not be changed without the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of a fund which is defined in the  act as the lesser of a  or more of the shares present at a fund meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund are present or represented by proxy or b more than  of the outstanding shares each funds investment objective is a nonfundamental policy which may be changed by the board of trustees at any time for each fund  except as otherwise permitted by the  act or interpretations or modifications by or exemptive or other relief from the sec or other authority with appropriate jurisdiction and disclosed to investors the fund may not borrow money except to the extent permitted under the  act which currently limits borrowing to no more than  of the value of the funds total assets  except as otherwise permitted by the  act or interpretations or modifications by or exemptive or other relief from the sec or other authority with appropriate jurisdiction and disclosed to investors the fund may not act as an underwriter of securities of other issuers except to the extent the fund may be deemed an underwriter under the securities act by virtue of disposing of portfolio securities  except as otherwise permitted by the  act or interpretations or modifications by or exemptive or other relief from the sec or other authority with appropriate jurisdiction and disclosed to investors the fund may not lend any securities or make loans to others for purposes of this investment restriction the purchase of debt obligations including acquisitions of loans loan participations or other forms of debt instruments and the entry into repurchase agreements shall not constitute loans by the fund  except as otherwise permitted by the  act or interpretations or modifications by or exemptive or other relief from the sec or other authority with appropriate jurisdiction and disclosed to investors the fund may not issue any senior security as such term is defined in section f of the  act except insofar as the fund may be deemed to have issued a senior security by reason of borrowing money in accordance with the funds borrowing policies for purposes of this investment restriction collateral escrow or margin or other deposits with respect to the making of short sales the purchase or sale of futures contracts or options purchase or sale of forward foreign currency contracts and the writing of options on securities are not deemed to be an issuance of senior security  except as otherwise permitted by the  act or interpretations or modifications by or exemptive or other relief from the sec or other authority with appropriate jurisdiction and disclosed to investors the fund may not purchase hold or deal in real estate but the fund may purchase and sell securities that are secured by real estate or issued by companies that invest or deal in real estate or real estate investment trusts and may acquire and hold real estate or interests therein through exercising rights or remedies with regard to such securities  except as otherwise permitted by the  act or interpretations or modifications by or exemptive or other relief from the sec or other authority with appropriate jurisdiction and disclosed to investors the fund may not invest in physical commodities or physical commodities contracts except that the fund may purchase and sell options forward contracts futures contracts including those related to indices and options on futures contracts or indices and enter into swap agreements and other derivative instruments  except as otherwise permitted by the  act or interpretations or modifications by or exemptive or other relief from the sec or other authority with appropriate jurisdiction and disclosed to investors the fund may not invest more than  of the value of its total assets in the securities of issuers in any single industry provided that there shall be no limitation on the purchase of obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities or as otherwise permitted by the sec except in the case of the percentage limitation set forth in investment restriction no  the percentage limitations contained in the foregoing restrictions apply at the time of the purchase of the securities and a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in the values of the securities or in the amount of a funds assets will not constitute a violation of the restriction portfolio transactions decisions to buy and sell securities and other financial instruments for the funds are made by alger management which also is responsible for placing these transactions subject to the overall review of the trusts board of trustees although investment requirements for the funds are reviewed independently from those of the other accounts and funds managed by alger management investments of the type the funds may make may also be made by these other accounts or funds when a fund and one or more other funds or accounts managed by alger management are prepared to invest in or desire to dispose of the same security or other financial instrument available investments or opportunities for sales will be allocated in a manner believed by alger management to be equitable to each in some cases this procedure may affect adversely the price paid or received by the fund or the size of the position obtained or disposed of by the fund transactions in equity securities are in most cases effected on us stock exchanges or in overthecounter markets and involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions where there is no stated commission as in the case of certain securities traded in the overthecounter markets the prices of those securities include undisclosed commissions or markups purchases and sales of money market instruments and debt securities usually are principal transactions these securities are normally purchased directly from the issuer or from an underwriter or market maker for the securities the cost of securities purchased from underwriters includes an underwriting commission or concession and the prices at which securities are purchased from and sold to dealers include a dealers markup or markdown us government securities are generally purchased from underwriters or dealers although certain newlyissued us government securities may be purchased directly from the us treasury or from the issuing agency or instrumentality a funds turnover rate is calculated by dividing the lesser of purchases or sales of securities for the fiscal year by the monthly average of the value of the funds securities with obligations with less than one year to maturity excluded a  turnover rate would occur for example if all included securities were replaced once during the year a fund will not normally engage in the trading of securities for the purpose of realizing shortterm profits but will adjust its holdings as considered advisable in view of prevailing or anticipated market conditions and turnover will not be a limiting factor should alger management deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities in alger managements view companies are organic entities that continuously undergo changes in response to among other things economic market environmental technological political and managerial factors generally securities will be purchased for capital appreciation and not for shortterm trading profits however each fund may dispose of securities without regard to the time they have been held when such action for defensive or other purposes appears advisable moreover it is alger managements philosophy to pursue each funds investment objective by managing the fund actively which may result in high portfolio turnover increased portfolio turnover will have the effect of increasing the funds brokerage and custodial expenses to the extent consistent with applicable provisions of the  act and the rules and exemptions adopted by the sec thereunder as well as other regulatory requirements the trusts board of trustees has determined that portfolio transactions will generally be executed through fred alger  company incorporated alger inc if in the judgment of alger management the use of alger inc is likely to result in price and execution at least as favorable as those of other qualified brokerdealers and if in particular transactions alger inc charges the funds involved a rate consistent with that which other brokerdealers charge to comparable unaffiliated customers in similar transactions overthecounter purchases and sales are transacted directly with principal market makers except in those cases in which better prices and executions may be obtained elsewhere principal transactions are not entered into with affiliates of the trust except pursuant to exemptive rules or orders adopted by the sec in selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the funds alger management seeks the best overall terms available in assessing the best overall terms available for any transaction alger management will consider the factors it deems relevant including the breadth of the market in the investment the price of the investment the financial condition and execution capability of the broker or dealer and the reasonableness of the commission if any for the specific transaction and on a continuing basis in addition alger management is authorized in selecting parties to execute a particular transaction and in evaluating the best overall terms available to consider the brokerage and research services as those terms are defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended provided to the funds involved the other funds andor other accounts over which alger management or its affiliates exercise investment discretion to the extent permitted by law alger managements fees under its agreement with the funds are not reduced by reason of its receiving brokerage and research services the board of trustees will periodically review the commissions paid by the funds to determine if the commissions paid over representative periods of time are reasonable in relation to the benefits received by the fund alger inc does not engage in principal transactions with the trust and accordingly received no compensation in connection with securities purchased or sold in that manner which include securities traded in the overthecounter markets money market investments and most debt securities disclosure of portfolio holdings the trust on behalf of the funds has ongoing arrangements

its distributions so as to avoid the application of this tax although the trust expects each fund to make such distributions as are necessary to avoid the application of this tax certain of such distributions if made in january might be included in the taxable income of shareholders in the year ended in the previous december payments reflecting the dividend income of the funds will not qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporations if the fund sells the underlying stock before satisfying a day holding period requirement  days for certain preferred stock dividendsreceived deductions will be allowed to a corporate shareholder only if similar holding period requirements with respect to shares of the fund have been met in general any gain or loss on the redemption or exchange of fund shares will be longterm capital gain or loss if held by the shareholder for more than one year and will be shortterm capital gain or loss if held for one year or less however if a shareholder receives a distribution taxable as longterm capital gain with respect to fund shares and redeems or exchanges the shares before holding them for more than six months any loss

gains will generally be taxable as ordinary income distributions of longterm capital gains will be taxable as such at the appropriate rate regardless of the length of time you have held shares of the fund if a fund is the holder of record of any stock on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such stock such dividends are included in the funds gross income as of the later of a

acquired such stock accordingly in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements a fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case investors considering buying shares of a fund just prior to a record date for a taxable dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that regardless of whether the price of the fund shares to be purchased reflects the amount of the forthcoming dividend or distribution payment any such payment will be a taxable dividend or distribution payment if a shareholder fails to furnish a correct taxpayer identification number fails to fully report dividend or interest income or fails to certify that he or she has provided a correct taxpayer identification number and that he or she is not subject to such withholding then the shareholder may be subject to a  percent backup withholding tax with respect to i any taxable dividends and distributions and ii any proceeds of any redemption of fund shares an individuals taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number the  percent backup withholding tax is not an

organization the trust is a diversified openend management investment company from its inception in  until february   the trust was organized as a massachusetts business corporation and had operated

the trust was changed from spectra fund inc to spectra fund the trust is authorized to offer an unlimited number of shares the trust intends to change its name to the spectra funds in early  the trust is a series fund which is a mutual fund divided into separate portfolios each of which is treated as a separate entity for certain matters under the  act and for other purposes a shareholder of one portfolio is not deemed to be a shareholder of any other portfolio for certain matters shareholders vote together as a group as to others they vote separately by portfolio to date the board has authorized the creation of four series of shares all consideration received by the trust for shares of a series and all assets in which such consideration is invested will belong to that series subject only to the rights of creditors of the trust and will be subject to the liabilities related thereto the income attributable to and the expenses of a series will be treated separately from those of the other series the trust has the ability to create from time to time new series without shareholder approval rule f under the  act provides that any matter required to be submitted under the provisions of the  act or applicable state law or otherwise to the holders of the outstanding voting securities of an investment company such as the trust will not be deemed to have been effectively acted upon unless approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each series affected by such matter rule f further provides that a series shall be deemed to be affected by a matter unless it is clear that the interests of each series in the matter are identical or that the matter does not affect any interest of such series the rule exempts the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm and the election of trustees from the separate voting requirements of the rule although as a massachusetts business trust the trust is not required by law to hold annual shareholder meetings it may hold meetings from time to time on important matters and shareholders have the right to call a meeting to remove a trustee or to take other action described in the trusts declaration of trust meetings of shareholders normally will not be held for the purpose of electing trustees unless and until such time as less than a majority of the trustees holding office have been elected by shareholders at which time the trustees then in office will call a shareholders meeting for the election of trustees under the act shareholders of record of no less than twothirds of the outstanding shares of the trust may remove a trustee through a declaration in writing or by vote cast in person or by proxy at a meeting called for that purpose under the trust agreement the trustees are required to call a meeting of shareholders for the purpose of voting on the question of removal of any such trustee when requested in writing to do so by the shareholders of record of not less than  of the funds outstanding shares shares do not have cumulative voting rights which means that holders of more than  of the shares voting for the election of trustees can elect all trustees shares have equal voting rights which cannot be adversely modified other than by majority vote shares are transferable but have no preemptive conversion or subscription rights physical shares certificates are not issued for shares of the trust massachusetts law provides that shareholders could under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust however the trust agreement disclaims shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the trust and requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or a trustee the trust agreement provides for indemnification from the trusts property for all losses and expenses of any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the trust thus the risk of a shareholders incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which the trust itself would be unable to meet its obligations a possibility that the trust believes is remote upon payment of any liability incurred by the trust the shareholder paying the liability will be entitled to reimbursement from the general assets of the trust the trustees intend to conduct the operations of the trust in a manner so as to avoid as far as possible ultimate liability of the shareholders for liabilities of the trust each

companies tend to fall into one of two categories o high unit volume growth vital creative companies which offer goods or services to a rapidly expanding marketplace they include both established and emerging firms offering new or improved products or firms simply fulfilling an increased demand for an existing line o positive life cycle change companies experiencing a major change which is expected to produce advantageous results these changes may be as varied as new management products or technologies restructuring or reorganization or merger and acquisition the funds may invest in companies of any market capitalization the market capitalization of a company is its price per share multiplied by its number of outstanding shares each funds portfolio managers may sell a stock when it reaches a target price fails to perform as expected or when other opportunities appear more attractive as a result of this disciplined investment process each fund may engage in active trading of portfolio securities if a fund does trade in this way it may incur increased transaction costs and brokerage commissions both of which can lower the actual return on an investment active trading may also increase shortterm gains and losses which may affect the taxes a shareholder has to pay each of the funds may purchase put and call options and sell write covered put and call options on securities and securities indexes to increase gain or to hedge against the risk of unfavorable price movements each of the funds can leverage that is borrow money to buy additional securities by borrowing money a fund has the potential to increase its returns if the increase in the value of the securities purchased exceeds the cost of borrowing including interest paid on the money borrowed

the manager conduct their business in an environmentally sustainable manner while demonstrating promising growth potential these are companies that have shown a commitment to environmental sustainability as demonstrated through their business strategies practices or investments the fund seeks to invest in companies that have developed or are developing or marketing products or services that address human needs without undermining natures ability to support our economy into the future the funds investment strategy consists of fundamental analysis combined with an environmental sustainability investment process in selecting stocks the manager uses fundamental analysis to identify innovative and dynamic companies and uses screens that identify and rank stocks within an industry or sector based on several sustainability characteristics spectra alchemy fund alchemy fund  investment objective the fund seeks longterm capital appreciation principal strategy under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities the fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization from larger wellestablished companies to small emerging growth companies the funds benchmark is the russell r growth index which is an index of common stocks designed to track performance of companies with greater than average growth orientation in general the equity research analysts of the manager select investments for the fund that represent certain investment ideas in all market capitalizations

located in emerging market countries although the allocation of the funds assets to emerging market countries will vary from time to time the fund may but is not required to use derivatives such as

normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities including common stocks american depositary receipts and global depositary receipts of foreign companies foreign companies are companies i that are organized under the laws of a foreign country ii whose principal trading market is in a foreign country or iii that have a majority of their assets or that derive a significant portion of their revenue or profits from businesses investments or sales outside the united states the fund generally invests in at least three foreign countries and at times may invest a substantial portion of its assets in a single foreign country the fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization from larger

countries will vary from time to time the manager seeks investment opportunities in companies with fundamental strengths that indicate the potential for sustainable growth the manager focuses on individual stock selection building the funds portfolio from the bottom up through extensive fundamental research in addition to using fundamental research the manager employs a quantitative investment approach to selecting investments a quantitative investment approach relies on financial models and computer databases to assist in the stock selection process proprietary computer models are capable of rapidly ranking a large universe of eligible investments using an array of traditional factors applied in financial analysis such as cash flow earnings growth and price to earnings ratios as well as other nontraditional factors  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th principal risks  risks applicable to each fund as with any equity fund your investment will fluctuate in value and the loss of your investment is a risk of investing a funds price per share will fluctuate due to changes in the market prices of its investments the value of a funds investments may not grow as fast as the rate of inflation and stocks tend to be more volatile than some other investments you can make such as bonds based on a funds investment objective an investment in a fund may be better suited for investors who seek longterm capital growth and can tolerate fluctuations in their investments value prices of growth stocks tend to be higher in relation to their companies earnings and may be more sensitive to market political and economic developments than other stocks making their prices more volatile trading in growth stocks may be relatively shortterm meaning that a fund may buy a security and sell it a short time later if it is believed that an alternative investment may provide greater future growth this activity may create higher transaction costs due to commissions and other expenses and thereby adversely affect fund performance in addition a high level of shortterm trading may increase a funds realized gains thereby increasing the amount of taxable distributions to shareholders at the end of the year investing in companies of all capitalizations involves the risk that smaller issuers in which a fund invests may have limited product lines or financial resources or lack management depth a funds investments in small cap stocks are subject to the possibility that it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a security position at a time and price acceptable to a fund due to the potentially less frequent trading of stocks of smaller capitalization companies the funds may use derivative instruments such as options futures and options on futures including those relating to stocks indexes and foreign currencies and forward contracts a small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on a funds performance the use of derivatives involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value and there is the risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by a fund will not correlate with the underlying instruments or the funds other investments derivative instruments also involve the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the derivative instruments to make required payments or otherwise comply with the derivative instruments terms if the manager incorrectly predicts the price movement of a security or market an option held by a fund may expire unexercised and the fund will lose the premium it paid for the option or the fund as the writer of an option may be required to purchase or sell the optioned security at a disadvantageous price or settle an index option at a loss also an imperfect correlation between a hedge and the securities hedged may render the hedge partially ineffective  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th the risk that the cost of borrowing money to leverage will exceed the returns for the securities purchased or that the securities purchased may actually go down in value thus the funds net asset value could decrease more quickly than if it had not borrowed there may be additional risks applicable to a specific fund because of its investment approach to the extent that a fund invests in securities other than those that are its primary focus the investment risks associated with such other investments are described in this prospectus and the statement of additional information you should read that information carefully risks applicable to green fund  the funds environmental sustainability investment criteria may limit the number of investment opportunities available to the fund and as a result at times the funds returns may be less than those of funds that are not subject to such special investment considerations moreover companies that promote environmentally sensitive programs may not perform as well as companies that do not pursue such goals risks applicable to alchemy fund and international fund  investing in companies of all capitalizations involves the risk that smaller issuers in which the funds invest may have limited product lines or financial resources or lack management depth the funds investments in small cap stocks are subject to the possibility that it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a security position at a time and price acceptable to a fund owing to the potentially less frequent trading of stocks of smaller market capitalization companies a funds performance will be influenced by political social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign companies special risks associated with investments in foreign companies include exposure to currency fluctuations less liquidity less developed or less efficient trading markets lack of comprehensive company information political instability and differing auditing and legal standards the securities of issuers located in emerging markets can be more volatile and less liquid than those of issuers in more mature economies investing in emerging markets involves higher levels of risk including increased currency information liquidity market political and valuation risks deficiencies in regulatory oversight market infrastructure shareholder protections and company laws could expose the fund to operational and other risks as well some countries may have restrictions that could limit the funds access to attractive opportunities additionally emerging markets often face serious economic problems such as high external debt inflation and unemployment that could subject the fund to increased volatility or substantial declines in value investments in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the us dollar or in the case of hedged positions that the us dollar will decline relative to the currency being hedged currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will reduce the value of securities held by a fund and denominated in those currencies foreign currencies also are subject to risks caused by inflation interest rates budget deficits and low savings rates political factors and government controls  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th performance  the following bar charts and the tables beneath them give you some indication of the risks of investing in a fund by showing changes in each funds performance from year to year and by showing how each funds average

returns these returns are calculated using the highest individual federal income and capital gains tax rates in effect at the time of each distribution and redemption but do not reflect state and

to a tax benefit to the shareholder actual aftertax returns will depend on your specific situation and may differ from those shown the aftertax returns shown will be irrelevant to investors owning fund shares through taxdeferred accounts such as iras or k plans the total returns reflect reinvestment of dividends and distributions remember that the funds past performance before and after taxes

the manager believes demonstrate promising growth potential green fund under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowing for investment purposes in equity securities of companies of any size that in the opinion of the manager conduct their business in an environmentally sustainable manner while demonstrating promising growth potential alchemy fund under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities the fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization from larger wellestablished companies to small emerging growth companies the funds benchmark is the russell r growth index which is an index of common stocks designed to track performance of companies with greater than average growth orientation in general the fund may invest up to  of its assets in securities of companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market countries although the allocation of the funds assets to emerging market countries will vary from time to time international fund under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in equity securities including common stocks american depositary receipts and global depositary receipts of foreign companies the fund generally invests in at least three foreign countries and at times may invest a substantial portion of its assets in a single foreign country the fund may invest in companies of any market capitalization from larger wellestablished companies to small emerging growth companies the fund may invest up to  of its assets in securities of companies whose principal business activities are located in emerging market countries although the allocation of the funds assets to emerging market countries will vary from time to time in general each fund like all other investments can provide two types of return income return and capital return income return is the income received from an investment such as interest on bonds and money market instruments and dividends from common and preferred stocks capital return is the change in the market value of an investment such as an increase in the price of a common stock or of shares of a fund total return is the sum of income return and capital return thus if a fund over a year produces four percent in income return and its shares increase in value by three percent its total return is seven percent in general the more capital return is emphasized over income return in an investment program the more risk is associated with the program growth funds such as the funds seek primarily capital return they invest primarily in common stocks and offer the opportunity of the greatest return over the long term but can be risky since their prices fluctuate with changes in stock market prices growth funds that invest in companies with smaller market capitalizations offer potential for significant price gains if the companies are successful but there is also the risk that the companies will not succeed and the price of the companies shares will drop in value growth funds that invest in larger more established companies generally offer relatively less opportunity for capital return but a greater degree of safety investors considering equity investing through the funds should carefully consider the inherent risks associated with an investment in each fund expectations of future inflation rates should be considered in making investment decisions and even though over the long term stocks may present attractive opportunities the results of an equity investment managed by a particular management firm may not match those of the market as a whole each fund may but is not required to use derivatives such as futures options and forward contracts as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying asset to increase returns to manage foreign currency risk or as part of a hedging strategy each fund may borrow only from banks and may not borrow in excess of onethird of the market value of its total assets less liabilities other than such borrowing these practices are deemed to be speculative and may cause a funds net asset value be more volatile than the net asset value of a fund that does not engage in these activities investment strategies and policies the prospectus discusses the investment objective of each fund and the principal strategies employed to achieve this objective this section contains supplemental information concerning the types of securities and other instruments in which each fund may invest the investment policies and portfolio strategies that each fund may utilize and certain risks attendant on those investments policies and strategies  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in general each fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in equity securities such as common or preferred stocks or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities including warrants and rights the spectra fund and green fund will invest primarily in companies whose securities are traded on domestic stock exchanges or in the overthecounter market international fund will invest primarily in securities traded on foreign exchanges and alchemy fund may invest in both these companies may be in the developmental stage may be older companies that appear to be entering a new stage of growth progress owing to factors such as management changes or development of new technology products or markets or may be companies providing products or services with a high unitvolume growth rate there is no guarantee that a funds objective will be achieved common and preferred stocks stocks represent shares of ownership in a company generally preferred stock has a specified dividend and ranks after bonds and before common stocks in its claim on income for dividend payments and on assets should the company be liquidated after other claims are satisfied common stockholders participate in company profits on a prorata basis profits may be paid out in dividends or reinvested in the company to help it grow increases and decreases in earnings are usually reflected in a companys stock price so common stocks generally have the greatest appreciation and depreciation potential of all corporate securities while most preferred stocks pay a dividend each fund may purchase preferred stock where the issuer has omitted or is in danger of omitting payment of its dividend such investments would be made primarily for their capital appreciation potential each fund may purchase trust preferred securities which are preferred stocks issued by a special purpose trust subsidiary backed by subordinated debt of the corporate parent these securities typically bear a market rate coupon comparable to interest rates available on debt of a similarly rated company holders of the trust preferred securities have limited voting rights to control the activities of the trust and no voting rights with respect to the parent company cash position in order to afford a fund the flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities for investments in accordance with its investment objective or to meet redemptions it may under normal circumstances hold up to  of its total assets in money market instruments including but not limited to certificates of deposit time deposits and bankers acceptances issued by domestic bank and thrift institutions us government securities commercial paper and repurchase agreements this amount may be higher than that maintained by other funds with similar investment objectives temporary defensive and interim investments when market conditions are unstable or the manager believes it is otherwise appropriate to reduce holdings in stocks the funds can invest up to  of assets in a variety of debt securities for defensive purposes the funds can also purchase these securities for liquidity purposes to meet cash needs due to the redemption of fund shares or to hold while waiting to reinvest cash received from the sale of other portfolio securities the funds can buy o highquality shortterm money market instruments including those issued by the us treasury or other government agencies o commercial paper shortterm unsecured promissory notes of domestic or foreign companies o shortterm debt obligations of corporate issuers certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances of domestic and foreign banks and savings and loan associations and o repurchase agreements shortterm debt securities would normally be selected for defensive or cash management purposes because they can normally be disposed of quickly are not generally subject to significant fluctuations in principal value and their value will be less subject to interest rate risk than longerterm debt securities bank obligations these are certificates of deposit bankers acceptances and other shortterm debt obligations certificates of deposit are shortterm obligations of commercial banks a bankers acceptance is a time draft drawn on a commercial bank by a borrower usually in connection with international commercial transactions certificates of deposit may have fixed or variable rates a fund will not invest in any debt security issued by a commercial bank unless i the bank has total assets of at least  billion or the equivalent in other currencies or in the case of domestic banks that do not have total assets of at least  billion the aggregate investment made in any one such bank is limited to  and the principal amount of such investment is insured in full by the federal deposit insurance corporation ii in the case of us banks it is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation and iii in the case of foreign banks the security is in the opinion of the manager of an investment quality comparable to other debt securities which may be purchased by the fund these limitations do not prohibit investments in  pbposst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st securities issued by foreign branches of us banks provided such us banks meet the foregoing requirements foreign bank obligations investments by a fund in foreign bank obligations and obligations of foreign branches of domestic banks present certain risks including the impact of future political and economic developments the possible imposition of withholding taxes on interest income the possible seizure or nationalization of foreign deposits the possible establishment of exchange controls andor the addition of other foreign governmental restrictions that might affect adversely the payment of principal and interest on these obligations in addition there may be less publicly available and reliable information about a foreign bank than about domestic banks owing to different accounting auditing reporting and recordkeeping standards in view of these risks alger management will carefully evaluate these investments on a casebycase basis small capitalization investments certain companies in which a fund will invest may still be in the developmental stage may be older companies that appear to be entering a new stage of growth owing to factors such as management changes or development of new technology products or markets or may be companies providing products or services with a high unit volume growth rate investing in smaller newer issuers generally involves greater risk than investing in larger more established issuers such companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may lack management depth their securities may have limited marketability and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than securities of larger more established companies or the market averages in general convertible securities each fund may invest in convertible securities which are debt instruments or preferred stocks that make fixed dividend or interest payments and are convertible into common stock generally the market prices of convertible securities tend to reflect price changes in their underlying common stocks but also tend to respond inversely to changes in interest rates convertible securities typically entail less market risk than investments in the common stock of the same issuers declines in their market prices are typically not as pronounced as those of their underlying common stocks like all fixedincome securities convertible securities are subject to the risk of default on their issuers payment obligations variable rate master demand notes these are unsecured instruments that permit the indebtedness thereunder to vary and provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate because these notes are direct lending arrangements between a fund and an issuer they are not normally traded although no active secondary market may exist for these notes a fund may demand payment of principal and accrued interest at any time or may resell the note to a third party while the notes are not typically rated by credit rating agencies issuers of variable rate master demand notes must satisfy alger management that the same criteria for issuers of commercial paper are met in addition when purchasing variable rate master demand notes alger management will consider the earning power cash flows and other liquidity ratios of the issuers of the notes and will continuously monitor their financial status and ability to meet payment on demand in the event an issuer of a variable rate master demand note were to default on its payment obligations a fund might be unable to dispose of the note because of the absence of a secondary market and could for this or other reasons suffer a loss to the extent of the default us government obligations each fund may invest in us government securities which include treasury bills treasury notes and treasury bonds that differ in their interest rates maturities and times of issuance treasury bills have initial maturities of one year or less treasury notes have initial maturities of one to ten years and treasury bonds generally have initial maturities of greater than ten years in addition to us treasury securities each fund may invest in securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities some obligations issued or guaranteed by us government agencies and instrumentalities are supported by the full faith and credit of the us treasury others by the right of the issuer to borrow from the treasury others by discretionary authority of the us government to purchase certain obligations of the agency or instrumentality and others only by the credit of the agency or instrumentality these securities bear fixed floating or variable rates of interest while the us government currently provides financial support to such us governmentsponsored agencies or instrumentalities no assurance can be given that it will always do so since it is not so obligated by law shortterm corporate debt securities these are outstanding nonconvertible corporate debt securities eg bonds and debentures which have one year or less remaining to maturity corporate notes may have fixed variable or floating rates  pbposnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd commercial paper these are shortterm promissory notes issued by corporations primarily to finance shortterm credit needs repurchase agreements under the terms of a repurchase agreement a fund would acquire a high quality money market instrument for a relatively short period usually not more than one week subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase and the fund to resell the instrument at an agreed price including accrued interest and time thereby determining the yield during the funds holding period repurchase agreements may be seen to be loans by the fund collateralized by the underlying instrument this arrangement results in a fixed rate of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the funds holding period and not necessarily related to the rate of return on the underlying instrument the value of the underlying securities including accrued interest will be at least equal at all times to the total amount of the repurchase obligation including interest the fund bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to a repurchase agreement declares bankruptcy or defaults on its obligations and the fund is delayed in or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral securities including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the underlying securities during the period in which the fund seeks to assert these rights the risk of incurring expenses associated with asserting these rights and the risk of losing all or part of the income from the agreement management reviews the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which the fund enters into repurchase agreements to evaluate these risks and monitors on an ongoing basis the value of the securities subject to repurchase agreements to ensure that the value is maintained at the required level warrants and rights each fund may invest in warrants and rights a warrant is a type of security that entitles the holder to buy a proportionate amount of common stock at a specified price usually higher than the market price at the time of issuance for a period of years or to perpetuity in contrast rights which also represent the right to buy common shares normally have a subscription price lower than the current market value of the common stock and a life of two to four weeks warrants are freely transferable and are traded on the major securities exchanges exchangetraded funds to the extent otherwise consistent with its investment policies and applicable law each fund may invest up to  of its total assets in exchangetraded funds etfs registered investment companies whose shares are listed on a national stock exchange etfs which may be unit investment trusts or mutual funds typically hold portfolios of securities designed to track the performance of various broad securities indexes or sectors of such indexes etfs thus provide another means in addition to futures and options on indexes of creating or hedging stock index exposure in the funds investment strategies restricted and illiquid securities each fund may invest in restricted securities ie securities which are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on their resale these restrictions might prevent the sale of the securities at a time when a sale would otherwise be desirable in order to sell securities that are not registered under the federal securities laws it may be necessary for a fund to bear the expense of registration the funds may invest in restricted securities governed by rule a under the securities act of  as amended rule a is designed to facilitate efficient trading of unregistered securities among institutional investors rule a permits the resale to qualified institutions of restricted securities that when issued were not of the same class as securities listed on a us securities exchange or quoted on nasdaq in adopting rule a the securities and exchange commission the sec specifically stated that restricted securities traded under rule a may be treated as liquid for purposes of investment limitations if the board of trustees or the funds adviser acting subject to the boards supervision determines that the securities are in fact liquid the board has delegated its responsibility to alger management to determine the liquidity of each restricted security purchased pursuant to rule a subject to the boards oversight and review examples of factors that will be taken into account in evaluating the liquidity of a rule a security both with respect to the initial purchase and on an ongoing basis will include among others  the frequency of trades and quotes for the security  the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market in the security and  the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades eg the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer if institutional trading in restricted securities were to decline to limited levels the liquidity of the funds portfolio could be adversely affected a fund will not invest more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities which include restricted securities securities for which there is no readily available market and repurchase agreements with maturities of greater than  days however restricted securities that  pbposrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd are determined by the board of trustees to be liquid are not subject to this limitation short sales each fund may sell securities short against the box while a short sale is the sale of a security the fund does not own it is against the box if at all times when the short position is open the fund owns an equal amount of the securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable without further consideration for securities of the same issue as the securities sold short lending of portfolio securities in order to generate income and to offset expenses each fund may lend portfolio securities with a value up to   of the funds total assets including all collateral for such loans less liabilities exclusive of the obligation to return such collateral to brokers dealers and other financial organizations the fund will not lend securities to alger management or its affiliates by lending its securities the fund can increase its income by continuing to receive interest or dividends on the loaned securities as well as by either investing the cash collateral in shortterm securities or by earning income in the form of interest paid by the borrower when us government securities are used as collateral the fund will adhere to the following conditions whenever its securities are loaned a the fund must receive at least  cash collateral or equivalent securities from the borrower b the borrower must increase this collateral whenever the market value of the loaned securities including accrued interest exceeds the value of the collateral c the fund must be able to terminate the loan at any time d the fund must receive reasonable interest on the loan as well as any dividends interest or other distributions on the loaned securities and any increase in market value e the fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees in connection with the loan and f voting rights on the loaned securities may pass to the borrower provided however that if a material event adversely affecting the investment occurs the funds board of trustees must terminate the loan and regain the right to vote the securities a fund bears a risk of loss in the event that the other party to a stock loan transaction defaults on its obligations and the fund is delayed in or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the collateral securities during the period in which the fund seeks to assert these rights the risk of incurring expenses associated with asserting these rights and the risk of losing all or a part of the income from the transaction foreign securities spectra fund may invest up to  of the value of its total assets and each of green fund alchemy fund and international fund may invest without limit in foreign securities not including american depositary receipts american depositary shares or us dollardenominated securities of foreign issuers foreign securities investments may be affected by changes in currency rates or exchange control regulations changes in governmental administration or economic or monetary policy in the united states and abroad or changed circumstances in dealing between nations dividends paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes that may decrease the net return on these investments as compared to dividends paid to the fund by domestic corporations there may be less publicly available information about foreign issuers than about domestic issuers and foreign issuers are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements comparable to those of domestic issuers securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers and foreign brokerage commissions are generally higher than in the united states foreign securities markets may also be less liquid more volatile and subject to less government supervision than those in the united states investments in foreign countries could be affected by other factors not present in the united states including expropriation confiscatory taxation and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations securities purchased on foreign exchanges may be held in custody by a foreign bank or a foreign branch of a domestic bank the risks associated with investing in foreign securities are often heightened for investments in emerging markets countries these heightened risks include i greater risks of expropriation confiscatory taxation nationalization and less social political and economic stability ii the small size of the markets for securities of emerging markets issuers and the currently low or nonexistent volume of trading resulting in lack of liquidity and in price volatility iii certain national policies which may restrict the funds investment opportunities including restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests and iv the absence of developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment and private property a funds purchase and sale of portfolio securities in certain emerging markets countries may be constrained by limitations as to daily changes in the prices of listed securities periodic trading or settlement volume andor limitations on aggregate holdings of foreign investors in certain cases such limitations may be computed based upon the aggregate trading by or holdings of the fund alger management and its affiliates and its clients and other service providers the fund may not be able to sell  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th securities in circumstances where price trading or settlement volume limitations have been reached these limitations may have a negative impact on a funds performance and may adversely affect the liquidity of the funds investment to the extent that it invests in certain emerging market countries in addition some emerging markets countries may have fixed or managed currencies which are not freefloating against the us dollar further certain emerging markets countries currencies may not be internationally traded certain of these currencies have experienced volatility relative to the us dollar if a fund does not hedge the us dollar value of securities it owns denominated in currencies that are devalued the funds net asset value will be adversely affected if the fund hedges the us dollar value of securities it owns denominated in currencies that increase in value the fund will not benefit from the hedge it purchased and will lose the amount it paid for the hedge many emerging markets countries have experienced substantial and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation for many years inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of certain of these countries each fund may purchase american depositary receipts adrs american depositary shares adss or us dollardenominated securities of foreign issuers which are not subject to spectra funds  foreign securities limitation adrs and adss are traded in us securities markets and represent the securities of foreign issuers while adrs and adss may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the foreign securities they represent many of the risks associated with foreign securities may also apply to adrs and adss these securities may be purchased through sponsored or unsponsored facilities a sponsored facility is established jointly by the issuer of the underlying security and a depositary a depositary may establish an unsponsored facility without participation by the issuer of the deposited security holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all the costs of such facilities and the depositary of an unsponsored facility frequently is under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through voting rights to the holders of such receipts in respect of the deposited securities derivative transactions each fund may invest in or enter into derivatives for a variety of reasons including to hedge certain market or interest rate risks to provide a substitute for purchasing or selling particular securities or to increase potential returns generally derivatives are financial contracts whose value depends upon or is derived from the value of an underlying asset reference rate or index and may relate to stocks bonds interest rates currencies or currency exchange rates and related indexes examples of derivative instruments the funds may use include but are not limited to options contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts derivatives may provide a cheaper quicker or more specifically focused way for the fund to invest than traditional securities would alger management however may decide not to employ some or all of these strategies for a fund and there is no assurance that any derivatives strategy used by the fund will succeed derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk depending upon the characteristics of the particular derivative and the portfolio as a whole derivatives permit a fund to increase or decrease the level of risk or change the character of the risk to which its portfolio is exposed in much the same way as the fund can increase or decrease the level of risk or change the character of the risk of its portfolio by making investments in specific securities however derivatives may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest meaning that a small investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact on a funds performance if a fund invests in derivatives at inopportune times or judges market conditions incorrectly such investments may lower the funds return or result in a loss a fund also could experience losses if its derivatives were poorly correlated with the underlying instruments or the funds other investments or if the fund were unable to liquidate its position because of an illiquid secondary market the market for many derivatives is or suddenly can become illiquid changes in liquidity may result in significant rapid and unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives each fund as permitted may take advantage of opportunities in options and futures contracts and options on futures contracts and any other derivatives which are not presently contemplated for use by the fund or which are not currently available but which may be developed to the extent such opportunities are both consistent with the funds investment objective and legally permissible for the fund before a fund enters into such transactions or makes any such investment the fund will provide appropriate disclosure in its prospectus or this statement of additional information derivatives may be purchased on established exchanges or through privately negotiated transactions referred to as overthecounter derivatives exchangetraded derivatives generally are guaranteed by the clearing agency that is the issuer or counterparty to such derivatives this guarantee usually is supported by a daily variation margin system operated by the clearing agency in order to reduce overall credit risk as  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th a result unless the clearing agency defaults there is relatively little counterparty credit risk associated with derivatives purchased on an exchange in contrast no clearing agency guarantees overthecounter derivatives therefore each party to an overthecounter derivative bears the risk that the counterparty will default accordingly alger management will consider the creditworthiness of counterparties to overthecounter derivatives in the same manner as it would review the credit quality of a security to be purchased by a fund overthecounter derivatives are less liquid than exchangetraded derivatives since the other party to the transaction may be the only investor with sufficient understanding of the derivative to be interested in bidding for it some derivatives the funds use involve leverage eg an instrument linked to the value of a securities index may return income calculated as a multiple of the price movement of the underlying index this economic leverage will increase the volatility of these instruments as they may increase or decrease in value more quickly than the underlying security index futures contract currency or other economic variable pursuant to regulations andor published positions of the sec a fund may be required to segregate permissible liquid assets or engage in other measures approved by the sec or its staff to cover the funds obligations relating to its transactions in derivatives for example in the case of futures contracts or forward contracts that are not contractually required to cash settle a fund must set aside liquid assets equal to such contracts full notional value generally the total numerical value of the asset underlying a future or forward contract at the time of valuation while the positions are open with respect to futures contracts or forward contracts that are contractually required to cash settle however the fund is permitted to set aside liquid assets in an amount equal to the funds daily markedtomarket net obligation ie the funds daily net liability under the contracts if any rather than such contracts full notional value by setting aside assets equal to only its net obligations under cashsettled futures and forwards contracts a fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the fund were required to segregate assets equal to the full notional value of such contracts neither the trust nor the funds will be a commodity pool the trust has filed notice with the commodity futures trading commission and national futures association of its eligibility as a registered investment company for an exclusion from the definition of commodity pool operator and that neither the trust nor the funds is subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under the commodity exchange act futures transactionsin general all funds other than spectra fund a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a security for a set price on a future date these contracts are traded on exchanges so that in most cases either party can close out its position on the exchange for cash without delivering the security an option on a futures contract gives the holder of the option the right to buy from or sell to the writer of the option a position in a futures contract at a specified price on or before a specified expiration date although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities generally these obligations are closed out before delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts same exchange underlying security or index and delivery month closing out a futures contract sale is effected by purchasing a futures contract for the same aggregate amount of the specific type of financial instrument with the same delivery date if an offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale price the fund realizes a capital gain or if it is more the fund realizes a capital loss conversely if an offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price the fund realizes a capital gain or if it is less the fund realizes a capital loss transaction costs also are included in these calculations each fund other than spectra fund may enter into futures contracts in us domestic markets or on exchanges located outside the united states foreign markets may offer advantages such as trading opportunities or arbitrage possibilities not available in the united states foreign markets however may have greater risk potential than domestic markets for example some foreign exchanges are principal markets so that no common clearing facility exists and an investor may look only to the broker for performance of the contract in addition any profits that a fund might realize in trading could be eliminated by adverse changes in the currency exchange rate or the fund could incur losses as a result of those changes engaging in these transactions involves risk of loss to a fund which could adversely affect the value of the funds net assets although each fund intends to purchase or sell futures contracts only if there is an active market for such contracts no assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular contract at any particular time many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the trading day futures con  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th tract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting the fund to substantial losses successful use of futures by a fund also is subject to alger managements ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the relevant market and to the extent the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes to ascertain the appropriate correlation between the securities being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract for example if a fund uses futures to hedge against the possibility of a decline in the market value of securities held in its portfolio and the prices of such securities instead increase the fund will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value of securities which it has hedged because it will have offsetting losses in its futures positions furthermore if in such circumstances the fund has insufficient cash it may have to sell securities to meet daily variation margin requirements the fund may have to sell such securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so specific futures transactions each fund other than spectra fund may invest in futures contracts and options on futures contracts including those with respect to securities indexes interest rates and currencies each fund other than spectra fund may purchase and sell index futures contracts and options thereon an index future obligates the fund to pay or receive an amount of cash equal to a fixed dollar amount specified in the futures contract multiplied by the difference between the settlement price of the contract on the contracts last trading day and the value of the index based on the prices of the securities that comprise the index at the opening of trading in such securities on the next business day each fund other than spectra fund may purchase and sell interest rate futures contracts and options thereon an interest rate future obligates the fund to purchase or sell an amount of a specific debt security at a future date at a specific price each fund other than spectra fund may purchase and sell currency futures and options thereon a foreign currency future obligates the fund to purchase or sell an amount of a specific currency at a future date at a specific price options each fund may purchase put and call options and sell write covered put and covered call options on securities and securities indexes to increase gain or to hedge against the risk of unfavorable price movements although as in the past it does not currently intend to rely on these strategies extensively if at all the funds may only buy or sell options that are listed on a national securities exchange a call option on a security is a contract that gives the holder of the option the right to buy from the writer seller of the call option in return for a premium paid the security underlying the option at a specified exercise price at any time during the term of the option the writer of the call option has the obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise price during the option period a put option on a security is a contract that in return for the premium gives the holder of the option the right to sell to the writer seller the underlying security at a specified price during the term of the option the writer of the put who receives the premium has the obligation to buy the underlying security upon exercise at the exercise price during the option period a fund will not sell options that are not covered a call option written by the fund on a security is covered if the fund owns the underlying security covered by the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration or for additional cash consideration held in a segregated account upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio a call option is also covered if the fund holds a call on the same security as the call written where the exercise price of the call held is  equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or  greater than the exercise price of the call written if the difference is maintained by the fund in cash us government securities or other high grade shortterm obligations in a segregated account a put option is covered if the fund maintains cash or other highgrade shortterm obligations with a value equal to the exercise price in a segregated account or else holds a put on the same security as the put written where the exercise price of the put held is equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put written if a fund has written an option it may terminate its obligation by effecting a closing purchase transaction this is accomplished by purchasing an option of the same series as the option previously written however once the fund has been assigned an exercise notice the fund will be unable to effect a closing purchase transaction similarly if the fund is the holder of an option it may liquidate its position by effecting a closing sale transaction this is accomplished by selling an option of the same series as the option previously purchased there can be no assurance that either a closing purchase or sale transaction can be effected when a fund so desires  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th a fund will realize a profit from a closing transaction if the price of the transaction is less than the premium received from writing the option or is more than the premium paid to purchase the option the fund will realize a loss from a closing transaction if the price of the transaction is more than the premium received from writing the option or less than the premium paid to purchase the option since call option prices generally reflect increases in the price of the underlying security any loss resulting from the repurchase of a call option may also be wholly or partially offset by unrealized appreciation of the underlying security other principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand interest rates the current market price and price volatility of the underlying security and the time remaining until the expiration date an option position may be closed out only on an exchange which provides a secondary market for an option of the same series although the funds will generally not purchase or write options that appear to lack an active secondary market there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any particular option in such event it might not be possible to effect closing transactions in particular options so that the fund would have to exercise its option in order to realize any profit and would incur brokerage commissions upon the exercise of the options if a fund as a covered call option writer is unable to effect a closing purchase transaction in a secondary market it will not be able to sell the underlying security until the option expires or it delivers the underlying security upon exercise or otherwise covers the position in addition to options on securities the funds may also purchase and sell call and put options on securities indexes a stock index reflects in a single number the market value of many different stocks relative values are assigned to the stocks included in an index and the index fluctuates with changes in the market values of the stocks the options give the holder the right to receive a cash settlement during the term of the option based on the difference between the exercise price and the value of the index by writing a put or call option on a securities index the fund is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the fund may offset its position in stock index options prior to expiration by entering into a closing transaction on an exchange or it may let the option expire unexercised use of options on securities indexes entails the risk that trading in the options may be interrupted if trading in certain securities included in the index is interrupted the fund will not purchase these options unless alger management is satisfied with the development depth and liquidity of the market and alger management believes the options can be closed out price movements in a funds securities may not correlate precisely with movements in the level of an index and therefore the use of options on indexes cannot serve as a complete hedge and will depend in part on the ability of alger management to predict correctly movements in the direction of the stock market generally or of a particular industry because options on securities indexes require settlement in cash alger management may be forced to liquidate portfolio securities to meet settlement obligations although alger management will attempt to take appropriate measures to minimize the risks relating to any trading by the funds in put and call options there can be no assurance that a fund will succeed in any option trading program it undertakes a fund will not purchase options if as a result the aggregate cost of all outstanding options exceeds  of the funds total assets although no more than  will be committed to transactions entered into for nonhedging speculative purposes stock index futures and options on stock index futures futures are generally bought and sold on the commodities exchanges where they are listed with payment of initial and variation margin as described below the sale of a futures contract creates a firm obligation by the fund as seller to deliver to the buyer the net cash amount called for in the contract at a specific future time put options on futures might be purchased to protect against declines in the market values of securities occasioned by a decline in stock prices and securities index futures might be sold to protect against a general decline in the value of securities of the type that comprise the index options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract and obligates the seller to deliver such position a stock index future obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take an amount of cash equal to a specific dollar amount times the difference between the value of a specific stock index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the agreement is made no physical delivery of the underlying stocks in the index is made while incidental to its securities activities the fund may use index futures as a substitute for a comparable market position in the underlying securities if a fund uses futures or options thereon for hedging the risk of imperfect correlation increases as the com  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th position of the fund varies from the composition of the stock index in an effort to compensate for the imperfect correlation of movements in the price of the securities being hedged and movements in the price of the stock index futures the fund may if it uses a hedging strategy buy or sell stock index futures contracts in a greater or lesser dollar amount than the dollar amount of the securities being hedged if the historical volatility of the stock index futures has been less or greater than that of the securities such over hedging or under hedging may adversely affect the funds net investment results if market movements are not as anticipated when the hedge is established an option on a stock index futures contract as contrasted with the direct investment in such a contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a stock index futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option the fund will sell options on stock index futures contracts only as part of closing purchase transactions to terminate its options positions no assurance can be given that such closing transactions can be effected or that there will be correlation between price movements in the options on stock index futures and price movements in the funds securities which are the subject of the hedge in addition the funds purchase of such options will be based upon predictions as to anticipated market trends which could prove to be inaccurate a funds use if any of stock index futures and options thereon will in all cases be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and in particular the rules and regulations of the commodity futures trading commission and will be entered into only if at all for bona fide hedging risk management or other portfolio management purposes typically maintaining a futures contract or selling an option thereon will require the fund to deposit with a financial intermediary as security for its obligations an amount of cash or other specified assets initial margin which initially is typically  to  of the face amount of the contract but may be higher in some circumstances additional cash or assets variation margin may be required to be deposited thereafter on a daily basis as the mark to market value of the contract fluctuates the purchase of an option on stock index futures involves payment of a premium for the option without any further obligation on the part of the fund if the fund exercises an option on a futures contract it will be obligated to post initial margin and potential subsequent variation margin for the resulting futures position just as it would for any position futures contracts and options thereon are generally settled by entering into an offsetting transaction but there can be no assurance either that the position can be offset prior to settlement at an advantageous price or that delivery will occur in order to cover its potential obligations if the fund enters into futures contracts or options thereon the fund will maintain a segregated account which will contain only liquid assets in an amount equal to the total market value of such futures contracts less the amount of initial margin on deposit for such contracts a fund will not enter into a futures contract or related option except for closing transactions if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of its initial margin and premiums on open futures contracts and options thereon would exceed  of the funds total assets taken at current value however in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of the purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in calculating the  limitation foreign currency transactions each fund other than spectra fund may enter into foreign currency transactions for a variety of purposes including to fix in us dollars between trade and settlement date the value of a security the fund has agreed to buy or sell to hedge the us dollar value of securities the fund already owns particularly if it expects a decrease in the value of the currency in which the foreign security is denominated or to gain or reduce exposure to the foreign currency for investment purposes the currency exposure of the funds portfolio typically will be unhedged to the us dollar foreign currency transactions may involve for example a funds purchase of foreign currencies for us dollars or the maintenance of short positions in foreign currencies a short position would involve the fund agreeing to exchange an amount of a currency it did not currently own for another currency at a future date in anticipation of a decline in the value of the currency sold relative to the currency the fund contracted to receive a funds success in these transactions may depend on the ability of alger management to predict accurately the future exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time they generally are determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets and the relative merits of investments in different countries actual or perceived changes in interest rates and other complex factors as seen from an international perspective currency exchange rates also can be affected unpredictably by intervention or failure to intervene by us or foreign governments or central banks or by currency controls or political developments in the united states or abroad  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th swap transactions each fund other than spectra fund may engage in swap transactions including currency swaps index swaps and interest rate swaps a fund may enter into swaps for both hedging purposes and to seek to increase total return a fund also may enter into options on swap agreements sometimes called swaptions swap agreements are two party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than one year in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or differentials in rates of return earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments the gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount ie the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate in a particular foreign currency or in a basket of swaps or securities representing a particular index the notional amount of the swap agreement is only used as a basis upon which to calculate the obligations that the parties to a swap agreement have agreed to exchange most swap agreements entered into by the funds are cash settled and calculate the obligations of the parties to the agreement on a net basis thus a funds current obligations or rights under a swap agreement generally will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement the net amount a funds current obligations under a swap agreement will be accrued daily offset against any amounts owed to the fund and any accrued but unpaid net amounts owed to a swap counterparty will be covered by the segregation of permissible liquid assets of the fund a swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right but not the obligation in return for payment of a premium to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten extend cancel or otherwise modify an existing swap agreement at some designated future time on specified terms a cashsettled option on a swap gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the underlying swap as of the exercise date these options typically are purchased in privately negotiated transactions from financial institutions including securities brokerage firms depending on the terms of the particular option agreement a fund generally will incur a greater degree of risk when it writes a swap option than it will incur when it purchases a swap option when a fund purchases a swap option it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid should it decide to let the option expire unexercised however when a fund writes a swap option upon exercise of the option the fund will become obligated according to the terms of the underlying agreement the use of swap agreements is a highly specialized activity which involves strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions if alger management is incorrect in its forecasts of applicable market factors or a counterparty defaults the investment performance of the fund would diminish compared with what it would have been if these techniques were not used in addition it is possible that developments in the swap market including potential government regulation could adversely affect the funds ability to terminate existing swap agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements a fund will enter into swap agreements only when alger management believe it would be in the best interests of the fund to do so in addition a fund will enter into swap agreements only with counterparties that meet certain standards of creditworthiness generally such counterparties would have to be eligible counterparties under the terms of the funds repurchase agreement guidelines combined transactions each fund other than spectra fund may enter into multiple transactions including multiple options transactions multiple futures transactions multiple currency transactions including forward currency contracts and multiple interest rate transactions structured notes and any combination of futures options currency and interest rate transactions component transactions instead of a single transaction as part of a single or combined strategy when in the opinion of alger management it is in the best interests of the fund to do so a combined transaction will usually contain elements of risk that are present in each of its component transactions although combined transactions are normally entered into based on alger managements judgment that the combined strategies will reduce risk or otherwise more effectively achieve the desired portfolio management goal it is possible that the combination will instead increase such risks or hinder achievement of the portfolio management objective future developments each fund may take advantage of opportunities in options and futures contracts and options on futures contracts and any other derivatives which are not presently contemplated for use by the fund or which are not currently available but which may be developed to the extent such opportunities are both consistent with the funds investment objective and legally permissible for the fund before a fund enters into such transactions or makes

instances differ only in small degree from issues rated aaa sps highest rating bonds rated aaa are considered by sp to be the highest grade obligations and possess the ultimate degree of protection as to principal and interest with aa bonds as with aaa bonds prices move with the longterm money market bonds rated a by sp have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions sps bbbrated bonds or mediumgrade category bonds are borderline between definitely sound obligations and those where the speculative elements begin to predominate these bonds have adequate asset coverage and normally are protected by satisfactory earnings their susceptibility to changing conditions particularly to depressions necessitates constant watching these bonds generally are more responsive to business and trade conditions than to interest rates this group is the lowest that qualifies for commercial bank investment debt rated bb and b by sp is regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal while such debt will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions debt rated bb has less nearterm vulnerability to default than other speculative grade debt however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions that could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments the bb rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bbb rating debt rated b by sp has greater vulnerability to default but presently has the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments adverse business financial or economic conditions would likely impair capacity or willingness to pay interest and repay principal the b rating category also is used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bb or bb rating moodys bonds rated aa by moodys are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with bonds rated aaa moodys highest rating they comprise what are generally known as highgrade bonds aa bonds are rated lower than aaa bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as those of aaa bonds or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or a pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th appendix continued there may be other elements present that make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than those applicable to aaa securities bonds that are rated a by moodys possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper mediumgrade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment in the future moodys baarated bonds are considered as mediumgrade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well bonds rated ba by moodys are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as wellassured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class bonds rated b by moodys generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small moodys applies the numerical modifiers   and  to each generic rating classification from aa through b the modifier  indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category fitch bonds rated aaa by fitch are judged by fitch to be strictly highgrade broadly marketable suitable for investment by trustees and fiduciary institutions and liable to but slight market fluctuation other than through changes in the money rate the prime feature of an aaa bond is a showing of earnings several times or many times interest requirements with such stability of applicable earnings that safety is beyond reasonable question whatever changes occur in conditions bonds rated aa by fitch are judged by fitch to be of safety virtually beyond question and are readily salable whose merits are not unlike those of the aaa class but whose margin of safety is less strikingly broad the issue may be the obligation of a small company strongly secured but influenced as to rating by the lesser financial power of the enterprise and more local type of market bonds rated a by fitch are considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be strong but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings bbbrated bonds are considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be adequate adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances however are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds and therefore impair timely payment the likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings fitchs bbrated bonds are considered speculative the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes however business and financial alternatives can be identified which could assist the obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements fitchs brated bonds are considered highly speculative while bonds in this class are currently meeting debt service requirements the probability of continued timely payment of principal and interest reflects the obligors limited margin of safety and the need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the life of the issue dbrs bonds rated aaa by dbrs are considered to be of the highest credit quality with exceptionally strong protection for the timely repayment of principal and interest earnings are considered stable the structure of the industry in which the entity operates is strong and the outlook for future profitability is favorable there are few qualifying factors present which would detract from the performance of the entity the strength of liquidity and coverage ratios is unquestioned and the entity has established a creditable track record of superior performance given the extremely tough definition which a pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th appendix continued dbrs has established for this category few entities are able to achieve a aaa rating bonds rated aa are of superior credit quality and protection of interest and principal is considered high in many cases they differ from bonds rated aaa only to a small degree given the extremely tough definition which dbrs has for the aaa category which few companies are able to achieve entities rated aa are also considered to be strong credits which typically exemplify aboveaverage strength in key areas of consideration and are unlikely to be significantly affected by reasonably foreseeable events bonds rated a are of satisfactory credit quality protection of interest and principal is still substantial but the degree of strength is less than with aa rated entities while a respectable rating entities in the a category are considered to be more susceptible to adverse economic conditions and have greater cyclical tendencies than higher rated companies bonds rated bbb are considered to be of adequate credit quality protection of interest and principal is considered adequate but the entity is more susceptible to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions or there may be other adversities present which reduce the strength of the entity and its rated securities bonds rated bb are defined to be speculative where the degree of protection afforded interest and principal is uncertain particularly during periods of economic recession entities in the bb area typically have limited access to capital markets and additional liquidity support and in many cases small size or lack of competitive strength may be additional negative considerations bonds rated b are regarded as highly speculative and there is a reasonably high level of uncertainty as to the ability of the entity to pay interest and principal on a continuing basis in the future especially in periods of economic recession or industry adversity am best the issuer of longterm debt rated aaa has in am bests opinion an exceptional ability to meet the terms of its obligation the rating aa is assigned to issues where the issuer has in am bests opinion a very strong ability to meet the terms of its obligation and issues are rated a where the ability to meet the terms of the obligation is regarded as strong the issuer of debt rated bbb is considered to have an adequate ability to meet the terms of its obligation but to be more susceptible to changes in economic or other conditions the issuer of bbrated longterm debt has in am bests opinion speculative credit characteristics generally due to a moderate margin of principal and interest payment protection and vulnerability to economic changes the issuer of longterm debt rated b is considered to have extremely speculative credit characteristics generally due to a modest margin of principal and interest payment protection and extreme vulnerability to economic changes a pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th this page intentionally left blank pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th
