report on form q basis of presentation the following discussion of our historical performance and financial condition is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements on december   the hancock jv contributed to enviva lp all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in enviva pellets sampson llc sampson for total consideration of  million sampson owns a wood pellet production plant in sampson county north carolina the sampson plant the acquisition the sampson dropdown also included two offtake contracts and related thirdparty shipping contracts our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for periods prior to december   have been retroactively recast to reflect the consummation of the sampson dropdown as if it occurred on may   the date sampson was originally organized entities contributed by or distributed to our sponsor or the hancock jv are considered entities under common control and are recorded at historical cost with any excess consideration over cost being recorded as a distribution in partners capital business overview we are the worlds largest supplier by production capacity of utilitygrade wood pellets to major power generators we own and operate six industrialscale production plants in the southeastern united states that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of  million metric tons per year mtpy we also own a deepwater marine terminal at the port of chesapeake all of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics owning these costadvantaged assets the output from which is fully contracted in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows that should enable us to increase our perunit cash distributions over time which is our primary business objective our sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the partnership during  contracted volumes under our existing offtake contracts are approximately equal to the full production capacity of our production plants our offtake contracts provide for sales of  million metric tons mt of wood pellets in  and have a weightedaverage remaining term of  years from april   we intend to continue expanding our business by taking advantage of the growing demand for table of contents our product that is driven by the conversion of coalfired power generation and combined heat and power plants to cofired or dedicated biomassfired plants principally in the united kingdom and northern europe and increasingly in south korea and japan how we evaluate our operations adjusted gross margin per metric ton we use adjusted gross margin per metric ton to measure our financial performance we define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold we believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our revenuegenerating activities to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets adjusted ebitda we view adjusted ebitda as an important indicator of our financial performance we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization interest expense income tax expense early retirement of debt obligations noncash unit compensation expense asset impairments and disposals and certain items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks and research analysts to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure distributable cash flow we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discounts we use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare the cashgenerating performance of the partnership from period to period and to compare the cashgenerating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions if any that are expected to be paid to our unitholders we do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure nongaap financial measures adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations our nongaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable gaap financial measures you should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our definitions of these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled

attributable to enviva partners lp limited partners     factors impacting comparability of our financial results our future results of operations and cash flows may not be comparable to our historical consolidated results of operations and cash flows principally for the following reasons our sponsor contributed its interest in sampson to us on december   our historical condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsors interest in sampson as if the contributions had occurred on may   the date sampson was originally organized the recast amounts for the three months ended march   primarily include general and administrative expenses associated with plant development and table of contents commissioning costs incurred during the construction of the sampson plant we do not expect to incur these costs going forward as the plant began producing wood pellets during the fourth quarter of  we began deliveries under a new longterm firm offtake contract in december  in connection with the sampson dropdown the hancock jv assigned us a tenyear takeorpay offtake contract with dong energy thermal power as the dong contract the contract commenced september   and provides for sales of  mtpy for the first delivery year and  mtpy for years two through ten the contract accompanied by our increased production capacity from the sampson plant will have a material effect on our product sales and resulting gross margin we issued  million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to eligible purchasers on november   we and enviva partners finance corp a wholly owned subsidiary of the partnership formed on october   for the purpose of being the coissuer of the notes issued  million in aggregate principal amount of  senior unsecured notes due november   the senior notes to eligible purchasers in a private placement under rule a and regulation s of the securities act of  as amended the securities act which resulted in net proceeds of  million after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting discounts of  million on december   a portion of the net proceeds from the senior notes together with cash on hand and the issuance of  unregistered common units representing limited partnership interests in the partnership the common units at a value of  per unit or  million of common units to affiliates of john hancock life insurance company funded the consideration payable for the sampson dropdown the remainder of the net proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay certain outstanding term loan indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities as a result our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the outstanding debt and interest expense associated with the senior notes we repaid a portion of the original credit facilities and increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility on april   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement providing for a  million aggregate principal amount of senior secured credit facilities the original credit facilities we entered into an assumption agreement on december   providing for  million of incremental term loan borrowings the incremental term advances and together with the original credit facilities the senior secured credit facilities under the credit agreement in october  we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement the second amendment which became effective upon the closing of the sampson dropdown upon the consummation of the sampson dropdown a portion of the net proceeds from the senior notes together with cash on hand were used to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the tranche a and tranche a borrowings and to repay a portion of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the tranche a and tranche a borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities following the consummation of the sampson dropdown and repayment of a portion of the senior secured credit facilities the limit under our revolving credit commitments was increased from  million to  million pursuant to the second amendment revenue and costs for deliveries to customers can vary significantly between periods depending upon the specific shipment and reimbursement for expenses including the thencurrent cost of fuel depending on the specific offtake contract shipping terms are either cost insurance and freight cif or free on board fob under a cif contract we procure and pay for shipping costs which include insurance and all other charges up to the port of destination for the customer these costs are included in the price to the customer and as such are included in revenue and cost of goods sold under an fob contract the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs our customer shipping terms as well as the timing and size of shipments during the year can result in material fluctuations in our revenue recognition between periods but these terms generally have little impact on gross margin table of contents how we generate revenue overview we primarily earn revenue by supplying wood pellets to our customers under offtake contracts the majority of the commitments under which are longterm in nature we refer to the structure of our contracts as takeorpay because they include a firm obligation to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions that ensure we will be compensated in the case of a customers failure to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or termination of the contract each contract defines the annual volume of wood pellets that a customer is required to purchase and we are required to sell the fixed price per metric ton for product satisfying a base net calorific value and other technical specifications these prices are fixed for the entire term subject to annual inflationbased adjustments and price escalators as well as in some instances price adjustments for product specifications and changes in underlying costs in addition to sales of our product under these longterm takeorpay contracts we routinely sell volumes under shorterterm contracts which range in volume and tenor and in some cases may include only one specific shipment because each of our contracts is a bilaterally negotiated agreement our revenue over the duration of these contracts does not generally follow spot market pricing trends our revenue from the sale of wood pellets is recognized when the goods are shipped title passes the sales price to the customer is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured depending on the specific offtake contract shipping terms are either cif or fob under a cif contract we procure and pay for shipping costs which include insurance and all other charges up to the port of destination for the customer these costs are included in the price to the customer and as such are included in revenue and cost of goods sold under an fob contract the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs our customer shipping terms as well as the timing and size of shipments during the year can result in material fluctuations in our revenue recognition between periods but generally have little impact on gross margin the majority of the wood pellets we supply to our customers is produced at our production plants these sales are included in product sales we also fulfill our contractual commitments and take advantage of dislocations in market supply and demand by purchasing from and selling to thirdparty market participants including in some cases our customers in these backtoback transactions where title and risk of loss are immediately transferred to the ultimate purchaser revenue is recorded net of costs paid to the thirdparty supplier this revenue is included in other revenue in some instances a customer may request to cancel defer or accelerate a shipment contractually we will seek to optimize our position by selling or purchasing the subject shipment to or from another party either within our contracted offtake portfolio or as an independent transaction on the spot market in most instances the original customer pays us a fee including reimbursement of any incremental costs which is included in other revenue contracted backlog as of april   we had approximately  billion of product sales backlog for firm contracted product sales to power generators backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contracts contracted future product sales denominated in foreign currencies excluding revenue hedged with foreign currency forward contracts are included in us dollars at april   forward rates table of contents our expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of april   is as follows in millions period from april   to december     year ending december    year ending december   and thereafter  total product sales contracted backlog   costs of conducting our business cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes the costs to produce and deliver our wood pellets to customers the principal expenses incurred to produce and deliver our wood pellets consist of raw material production and distribution costs we have strategically located our plants in the southeastern united states a region with plentiful wood fiber resources we manage the supply of raw materials into our plants through a mixture of shortterm and longterm contracts delivered wood fiber costs include stumpage ie the price paid to the underlying timber resource owner for the raw material as well as harvesting transportation and in some cases size reduction services provided by our suppliers the majority of our product volumes are sold under contracts that include cost passthrough mechanisms to mitigate increases in raw material and distribution costs production costs at our production plants consist of labor energy tooling repairs and maintenance and plant overhead costs production costs also include depreciation expense associated with the use of our plants and equipment some of our offtake contracts include price escalators that mitigate inflationary pressure on certain components of our production costs in addition to the wood pellets that we produce at our owned and operated production plants we selectively purchase additional quantities of wood pellets from thirdparty wood pellet producers distribution costs include all transport costs from our plants to our port locations any storage or handling costs while the product remains at port and shipping costs related to the delivery of our product from our port locations to our customers both the strategic location of our plants and our ownership or control of our deepwater terminals has allowed for the efficient and costeffective transportation of our wood pellets we seek to mitigate shipping risk by entering into longterm fixedprice shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our contracts for which we are responsible for arranging shipping certain of our offtake contracts include pricing adjustments for volatility in fuel prices which allow us to pass the majority of fuel pricerisk associated with shipping through to our customers additionally as deliveries are made during the applicable contract term we amortize the purchase price of acquired customer contracts that were recorded as intangibles raw material production and distribution costs associated with delivering our wood pellets to our deepwater terminals and thirdparty wood pellet purchase costs are capitalized as a component of inventory fixed production overhead including the related depreciation expense is allocated to inventory based on actual wood pellet production these costs are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold distribution costs associated with shipping our wood pellets to our customers and amortization of favorable contracts are expensed as incurred our inventory is recorded using the firstin firstout method fifo which requires the use of judgment and estimates given the nature of our inventory the calculation of cost of goods sold is based on estimates used in the valuation of the fifo inventory and in determining the specific composition of inventory that is sold to each customer table of contents general and administrative expenses we and our general partner are party to a management services agreement the msa with enviva management company llc enviva management under the msa direct or indirect internal or thirdparty expenses incurred are either directly identifiable or allocated to us enviva management estimates the percentage of employee salary and related benefits thirdparty costs office rent and expenses and any other overhead costs to be provided to us each month enviva management allocates the actual costs accumulated in the financial accounting system using these estimates enviva management also charges us for any directly identifiable costs such as goods or services provided at our request we believe enviva managements assumptions and allocations have been made on a reasonable basis and are the best estimate of the costs that we would have incurred on a standalone basis our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsors interest in sampson as if the contribution had occurred on may   the date sampson was originally organized we do not develop plants or ports within the partnership and therefore we do not incur startup and commissioning costs or overhead costs related to construction activities prior to the consummation of the sampson dropdown sampson incurred general and administrative costs related to plant development activities which included startup and commissioning costs as well as incremental overhead costs related to construction activities we do not expect to incur these costs going forward as the plant began producing wood

adjusted gross margin per metric ton we define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold we believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our offtake pricing to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis adjusted gross margin per metric ton

retirement of debt obligations noncash unit compensation expense asset impairments and disposals and certain other items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing

operating results for the fourth quarter and fullyear  highlights completed the sampson dropdown acquisition on december   generated net revenue of  million and net income of  million for the fullyear  after giving effect to the recast for the sampson dropdown excluding the results of the sampson dropdown for the period prior to the acquisition date generated adjusted ebitda of  million for the fullyear  affirming fullyear  guidance for net income in a range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda in a range of  million to  million excluding the impact of any additional dropdowns or thirdparty acquisitions “strong plant performance and reduced costs across our operations enabled the partnership to deliver solid financial results for the year” said john keppler chairman and chief executive officer “we completed the sampson dropdown acquisition earlier than anticipated setting the stage for robust growth in ” presentation of recast financial results on december   the “acquisition date” we consummated the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in enviva pellets sampson llc “sampson” the acquisition consisted of a fully operational wood pellet production plant in sampson county north carolina the “sampson plant” a year  metric tons per year “mtpy” offtake contract with dong energy thermal power as “dong energy” a year  mtpy offtake contract with our sponsor’s joint venture and related thirdparty shipping contracts collectively the “sampson dropdown” because the sampson dropdown was a transfer between entities under common control generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” require that we recast our financial results to include the results of the sampson dropdown since the date sampson was originally organized in addition certain intercompany transactions between us and sampson during such periods have been eliminated and the results are presented as if the assets included in the sampson dropdown had been the partnership’s assets since sampson was initially organized as a result sampson’s results are now included in our results presented in accordance with gaap the effect of this recast is to present financial statements as if the partnership had developed the sampson plant when in fact it is our sponsor’s strategy to develop new projects outside the partnership unless otherwise indicated the financial results presented in this release are recast on this basis annual financial results for the fullyear  we generated net revenue of  million an increase of  percent or  million from  included in net revenue were product sales of  million during  and  million during  other revenue increased to  million in  from  million for  principally due to increased fees earned related to customer requests to adjust the timing of or cancel shipments we generated net income of  million in  compared to  million last year a decrease of  million driven principally by a  million noncash impairment charge associated with the planned sale of our smallest production plant located in wiggins mississippi and higher interest expense excluding the results of the sampson dropdown for the period prior to the acquisition date adjusted ebitda for  was  million an increase of  percent or  million from  the increase in adjusted ebitda was driven by increased other revenue and cost improvements across our operations during  primarily related to increased plant utilization lower raw material costs and lower fuel costs that reduced our toport logistics costs distributable cash flow prior to any distributions attributable to incentive distribution rights paid to the general partner was  million fourth quarter financial results for the fourth quarter of  we generated net revenue of  million an increase of  percent or  million from the corresponding quarter of  included in net revenue were product sales of  million an increase of  million from the corresponding quarter of last year due to an increased number of shipments under cif contracts which had the effect of increasing revenue and cost of sales as well as favorable contract pricing mix we had a net loss of  million compared to net income of  million for the fourth quarter of  a decrease of  million driven by the noncash impairment charge mentioned above and an increase in interest expense excluding the results of the sampson dropdown for the period prior to the acquisition date adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of  was  million an increase of  percent or  million from the corresponding period in  the increase in adjusted ebitda was driven by increased product sales and lower raw material costs distributable cash flow prior to any distributions attributable to incentive distribution rights paid to the general partner was  million distribution as announced february   the board of directors of our general partner declared a distribution of  per common and subordinated unit for the fourth quarter of  this distribution is  percent higher than the distribution for the fourth quarter of  the quarterly distribution will be paid on tuesday february   to unitholders of record as of the close of business on wednesday february   including the fourth quarter distribution the partnership will have distributed  per common and subordinated unit for fullyear  the partnership’s distributable cash flow excluding the results of the sampson dropdown for the period prior to the acquisition date and net of amounts attributable to incentive distribution rights was  million for  resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of  times outlook and guidance consistent with the guidance provided on november   the partnership expects fullyear  net income to be in the range of  million to  million and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of  million to  million the partnership expects to incur maintenance capital expenditures of  million and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount of  million in  as a result the partnership expects fullyear distributable cash flow to be in the range of  million to  million prior to any distributions attributable to incentive distribution rights paid to the general partner for fullyear  we expect to distribute at least  per common and subordinated unit the guidance amounts provided above do not include the impact of any additional acquisitions from the partnership’s sponsor or third parties although deliveries to our customers are generally ratable over the year the partnership’s quarterly income and cash flow are subject to modest seasonality in the first quarter and to the mix of customer shipments made which may vary from period to period as such the board of directors of the partnership’s general partner evaluates the partnership’s distribution coverage ratio on an annual basis when determining the distribution for a quarter market and contracting update our sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the partnership our current capacity is matched with a portfolio of offtake contracts that has a weightedaverage remaining term of  years from february   independent industry experts hawkins wright project that worldwide demand for industrial wood pellets will increase to approximately  million tons in  representing an annual growth rate of nearly  percent driven predominantly by biomass consumption in europe and asia the following are key recent developments dong energy the largest power producer in denmark announced in february  that it will completely eliminate the use of coal in its generation of power and heat by  and will replace the fuel with biomass dong energy already has two facilities burning wood pellets which are expected to consume approximately  million mtpy of wood pellets at full capacity in december drax power limited “drax” received eu stateaid approval of the contract for difference cfd through  for its third  megawatt “mw” biomass unit which is anticipated to require more than  million mtpy of wood pellets drax has stated that it could convert the remaining three coalburning units to biomass in the next two to three years under the right conditions in the netherlands biomass projects were awarded the majority of the  billion euros in funding available through the second and final round of applications for the  renewable incentive program including  billion euros awarded to coal plants planning to cofire biomass both rounds in  were heavily oversubscribed and rwe engie and uniper received awards the minister of economic affairs has announced that the program budget will be increased from  billion euros in  to  billion euros in  in november japan ratified the paris climate agreement demonstrating the government’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions as part of their plan for significant emissions reductions by  japan has set a target of  –  gigawatts “gws” of biomassfired capacity of which nearly  gws have been approved through japan’s feedin tariff fit program with many other projects that are either awaiting approval or expected to apply prior to the september deadline for the  award applications several power producers have announced biomass projects including japan’s largest electricity wholesaler electric power development company jpower which stated recently it expects to cofire biomass at all seven of its coalfired plants several recently announced biomassfueled projects in south korea are expected to be operational by  increasing the expected south korean demand for wood pellets up to  million mtpy as this demand is well in excess of expected domestic supply a significant amount of wood pellets are expected to be imported under longterm contracts representing a shift from the shortterm tender mechanism currently used to purchase biomass in south korea in january china’s national energy administration announced that the country will spend at least  billion on renewable energy through  in addition published reports indicate that china is expected to increase biomassfired generation capacity from  gws in  to  gws by  sponsor activity construction of our sponsor’s deepwater marine terminal in wilmington north carolina the “wilmington terminal” is complete the first shipment was loaded in december  the facility

the sampson dropdown had not occurred or ii include financial results of assets excluding the period prior to the acquisition date these illustrative presentations are not presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered alternatives to the presentation of the recast financial results of the partnership management views these presentations as important to reflect the partnership’s actual performance during  including as measured against our published guidance for  which did not include the impact of acquisitions we use adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow to measure our financial performance adjusted gross margin per metric ton we define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold we believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our revenuegenerating activities to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis adjusted gross margin per metric ton will be affected primarily by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization interest expense income tax expense early retirement of debt obligations noncash unit compensation expense asset impairments and disposals and certain items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks and research analysts to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure distributable cash flow we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount we use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare the cashgenerating performance of the partnership from period to period and to compare the cashgenerating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions if any that are expected to be paid to our unitholders we do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with gaap we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations our nongaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures each of these nongaap financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable gaap financial measures you should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton adjusted ebitda or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap our definitions of these

net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization interest expense income tax expense early retirement of debt obligations noncash unit compensation expense asset impairments and disposals and certain other items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks and research analysts to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure our estimates of incremental adjusted ebitda from the sampson plant are based on numerous assumptions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties the assumptions underlying such estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to significant business economic financial regulatory and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and amounts to differ materially from those estimates for more information about such significant risks and uncertainties please see the risk factors discussed or referenced in our filings with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” including the annual report on form k and the quarterly reports on form q most recently filed with the sec a reconciliation of estimated incremental adjusted ebitda to gaap net income is not provided because forwardlooking gaap net income generated by the sampson plant is not accessible and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort the amount of interest expense with respect to the sampson plant is not accessible or estimable at this time the amount of actual interest expense incurred could be significant such that the actual amount of net income generated by the sampson plant could vary substantially from the respective amount of estimated incremental adjusted ebitda cautionary note concerning forwardlooking statements certain statements and information in this press release including those concerning our future results of operations acquisition opportunities and distributions may constitute “forwardlooking statements” the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “plan” “intend” “foresee” “should” “would” “could” or other similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements which are generally not historical in nature these forwardlooking statements are based on the partnership’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on the partnership although management believes that these forwardlooking statements are reasonable when made there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the partnership will be those that it anticipates the forwardlooking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond the partnership’s control and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the partnership’s historical experience and its present expectations or projections important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to i the amount of products that the partnership is able to produce which could be adversely affected by among other things operating difficulties ii the volume of products that the partnership is able to sell iii the price at which the partnership is able to sell products iv changes in the price and availability of natural gas coal or other sources of energy v changes in prevailing economic conditions vi the partnership’s ability to complete acquisitions including acquisitions from its sponsor vii our ability to successfully negotiate and complete the acquisition of the sampson plant and associated contracts the “sampson acquisition” integrate the sampson plant into our existing operations and realize the anticipated benefits of the sampson acquisition viii unanticipated ground grade or water conditions ix inclement or hazardous weather conditions including extreme precipitation temperatures and flooding x environmental hazards xi fires explosions or other accidents xii changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof related to renewable or lowcarbon energy the forestry products industry or power generators xiii inability to acquire or maintain

material factors that could cause the partnership’s actual results to differ from projected results please read its filings with the sec including the annual report on form k and the quarterly reports
