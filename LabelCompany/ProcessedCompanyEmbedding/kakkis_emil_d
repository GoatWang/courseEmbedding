president and founder  everylife foundation for rare diseasesdedicated to accelerating biotechnology innovation for rare disease treatments advocating practical and scientifically sound change in policy and law to increase the efficiency  predictability of the development process we believe no disease is too rare to deserve treatment all treatments should be safe  effective we could be doing more with the science we have  tetrabenazime tabletsrare disease treatments are being developed but not all rare diseases benefit successes challenges many approved drugs thousands ultrarare diseases

treatments for ultrarare disorders challenging due to rarity or difficult biology ultrarare disorders little historical clinical or any other data difficult biology such as connective tissue or cns complex irreversible symptoms slow variable disease or hard to measure no valid surrogate measures of disease reversal biochemistry or imaging or neurophysiology  ultrarare designations and approvalsultrarare disease treatments few making it through the difficult development process at only  approvals per year it will take  years to develop treatments for half of them ultrarare designations and approvals  of designations and approvals  ultrarare disease treatment development is difficult but yet the science can be profoundmarket sizes are too small for normal investment by industry diseases are new to regulatory authorities with little data on history or endpoints yet we have science that can be translated we can do better  mucopolysaccharidosis i mps i hurler

phase patients receiving placebo showed an increase in the mwt distance of nearly  m whereas placebo patients showed a decrease of nearly  m the difference between groups was  m and on the main intent to treat analysis this difference approached statistical significance both groups showed a dip at week  which we believe was due to loss of a training effect at baseline patients underwent  mwt on successive days but at subsequent time points only  mwt was performed the week  value is closer to the true baseline in the extension phase patients who continued on aldurazyme showed an additional  meter increase the change from baseline nearly  meters was statistically significant the placebo crossover patients confirmed the treatment effect as they increased by a similar magnitude as the aldurazyme patients in the doubleblind phase the difference from week  was significant  fundamental issues in developmentlack of a predictable process for qualifying a biomarker for use in accelerated

allow for a more scientific rationalized application of the ich guidelines for safety studies incentivize create an additional market incentive to encourage industry drug sponsors to repurpose major market drugs for rare diseases  we can do more with the science we already havethe potential of drug repurposing for rare diseases many patented drugs already developed and approved for common conditions might effectively treat rare diseases of same pathway quality drugs with high potency and selectivity a single targeted drug is likely to have multiple therapeutic uses but rare disease indications will not be developed for patented drugs why not  roadblocks for repurposing large market drugs for rare diseasesthe perception of risk to a billion dollar product is too great to allow any rare disease development risks fear that potential adverse effects in clinical trials on very sick patients would risk the product’s market no benefit adding a few hundred or few thousand rare diseases patients does not increase market revenue enough to justify the costs of repurposing or the potential risk we need a solution to incentivize repurposing of patented drugs  key benefits of rarepurposing that would speed developmentsponsor already exists for the program leverages existing expertise of clinical development staff and scientists manufacturing and toxicology work complete safety is known in humans reduced time for development trials  approval focus on science and rare disease clinical studies rarepurposed orphan drugs will likely cost less than typical orphan products
