fmsbond  or email us state of munis if corporate tax rates were cut  if corporate tax rates were reduced to say  do you think the municipal bond market would be ok in terms of demand why did fed rates rise and muni rates ease  after the fed raised the benchmark lending rate by  last week why are municipal bond rates off  across all maturities and credit ratings an opportunity during muni redemptions  i have a laddered portfolio of california municipal bonds many of which were purchased in  at or around par most have coupon rates of  and are being redeemed this month in order to reinvest in similar munis i had to pay a  to  premium in your article “summer forecast a muni redemption flood supply drought” you said investors can often enhance their taxfree income when bonds are redeemed with regard to these  bonds i dont see how redemptions arent an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my taxfree income in the decreasingrate environment that has been in place for around  years shouldnt investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed why trust the muni bond rating agencies  moody’s and standard and poor’s proved their fallibility in  and beforetheir ratings are uselesswhy should i trust them now how can puerto rico bonds have aa rating  regarding your article bondholders after puerto rico’s bankruptcy filing i noticed you are still selling puerto rico bonds with an aa listingis there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones i ownhow do they get such a great rating determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond  in your recent article muni investors succeed by defying the odds you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first then yield how should i base my determination of quality ratings if so which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market what to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker  we have a “prudentinvestor” broker with another firm who put over  million into puerto rico bonds we almost killed him when we found out what he did now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return any advice we have about  million still invested we understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in puerto rico which is very slow to react premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal  i have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium if i buy for example a year facevalue muni bond with a  coupon for  par and pay a  premium over par i pay  to buy the bond when the bond matures i get back  and earn the stated yieldtomaturity when i purchased the bond assume that i can roll over a maturing  bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at  to obtain the  premium assume i go into my checking accountisnt the upfront  premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment that is isnt repayment of the  premium simply a return of my investment  not a return on my investment  medicare part b and taxexempt income  i can sign up for medicare soon and just learned that my rate for part b could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my taxexempt interest to my income this is very unfair has your company and others that sell bonds been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds  i live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments we have a  million bond portfolio that she manages she buys all fiveyear high yield  to  in todays  market munis with stiff premiums a recent purchase was a  par value  california muni with a fiveyear maturity we live in ca for which she paid over  the whole portfolio is like that please explain why she shouldnt buy premium bonds she wont listen to me or call me crazy and tell me its ok to rack up

situations long only bonds deep valuesummaryblackrock taxable municipal bond trust is the largest closedend mutual fund specializing in build america bondspublic sources including cefconnect morningstar and blackrock have confusing data about key portfolio characteristics such as yield to maturity duration and bond pricei calculate the yield to maturity bond price and effective duration for each of the  bonds in bbns portfolio and provide a worksheetblackrock taxable municipal america bond trust bbn is the largest and highestyielding closedend mutual fund that specializes in build america bonds a special class of taxable municipal securities issued pursuant to the  american recovery and reinvestment act in an earlier article “build america bonds the impact of yield chasing” i warned about the potential risks to these funds due to low net asset value discount and high interest rate sensitivity in this article i show that for the average investor finding disclosure about some of the key bondrelated metrics can be confusing due to the rather limited and nonstandardized disclosures required of closedend bond funds so let’s see what different data sources report on key risk and yield metrics for bbn cefconnect and morningstar first let’s look at cefconnect under the tab “portfolio characteristics” it reports an average coupon of  average maturity of  years but sadly no ytm interestingly enough neither average coupon nor average maturity look right which we’ll get to later source cefconnect website next let’s try morningstar under the “portfolio” tab we can see a weighted average coupon of “” sorry folks no decimals reported here and weighted average bond price of  sadly there is no mention of yield to maturity for duration they report an unadjusted duration of  years and a leverage adjusted duration of  years so these are starting to look more plausible but let’s investigate further source morningstar blackrock blackrock provides a fact sheet and a website summary first at their website we found the following as of july  here they show ytm of  average coupon of  weighted average maturity of  years and effective duration of  years source blackrock website blackrock’s latest fact sheet is from march  and can be found at this link the second page shows portfolio characteristics including yield to maturity of  effective duration of  years and weighted average life wal to worst of  years it looks like they mistakenly labeled this as a percentage below is my summary of what the various data sources list for maturity duration and ytm source maturity nysey duration y ytm  coupon  bond price cefconnect   morningstar     blackrock website    blackrock factsheet    deep dive into bbn holdings after reading these different data sources something didn’t look right to me first cefconnect’s coupon looked too high in the  time period when the babs were being offered to the market most were paying coupons in the  to  range at issuance there were a few higher rate but those would not have been enough to move the average coupon over  second the yield to maturity looked high a quick scan of some build america bond cusips indicated that individual bond ytms were clustered in the high s to low s so i didn’t think that a weighted average portfolio of these type of bonds could reach  two phone calls to blackrock did not help clarify matters as the phone representatives read from a script along the lines of yield to maturity is calculated as the discount rate that sets the present value of the bond’s future cash flows equal to its market price for bonds that are callable we used the yield to worst i have to say they train them for consistency at blackrock as i got the same speech from both representatives unfortunately they were unable to answer questions about how a portfolio ytm could be higher than the component bond ytms so i decided to verify this for myself as the different data sources varied i figured the only way to convince myself of the ytm and duration was to look at each of the  individual holdings listed in their portfolio i used the latest semiannual report from january   as the main data source in that report they helpfully report details about the issuer coupon rate maturity par value and market value for each of the  distinct bond holdings in the bbn portfolio an example follows below source sample information from blackrock bbn semiannual report armed with this information one can calculate duration and ytm the bond’s yield to maturity can be calculated using excel’s yield function and the duration can be calculated using the mduration function so i entered all  holdings into excel and calculated the price ytm and duration for each of their holdings the results are pictured below and i make my excel sheet available on my onedrive source bbn semiannual report january   and author’s calculations using marketvaluebased weightings par value and duration weightings are very similar i get an average coupon of  wal of  years average bond price of  ytm of  and a duration of  years these numbers look more in line with the current prices and yields in the build america bond market analysis of bbn distributions the current gross income of the bbn portfolio is  million a year this is calculated using the average coupon rate of  times par value of  billion the net asset value is  billion  billion in gross market value less  million in shortterm loans which means the gross investment income yield is  management fees are  million  of nav and interest expense is running at about  million  of nav this results in net investment income of  million a year or about  which compares very favorably to the  distribution in their factsheet future amortization of premium due to the lower interest rate environment compared to  most of the bonds in bbn’s portfolio are selling at a premium i calculated a weighted average premium of  assuming that this premium is amortized over the weighted average life of  years this is an erosion of  in the gross bond value every year because of the  leverage this translates to a  a year decline in the nav as these bonds will trend towards par as they approach maturity interest rate risks and impact of leverage if the true ytm of the portfolio is  then this looks like a lowrisk and sustainable distribution but the portfolio is not really a  billion portfolio of bonds with a  ytm bbn is actually  billion of bonds with a  ytm and a  million loan which is currently costing them  consider a scenario where longterm rates stay the same so the value of the municipal bonds doesn’t change but shortterm cost of borrowing increases from  to  now the interest cost goes to  million or  of nav now the distributable net income rate is  this drop in income can happen in a situation where there is no change in longterm bond rates where all the rising rates are on nearterm debt illustration below finally let’s consider a case of a bp increase in longterm rates which leads to a decline in value of the overall bonds of  using my calculated  year duration in this illustration there is no change in income as the shortterm rates have been kept constant at  and only longterm rates increased by  leading to a price impact this leads to a  drop in the gross value of the portfolio which is a  drop in the nav call risk though i am not an expert on the call characteristics of the individual bonds in bbn’s portfolio a commenter on my other article pointed out several build america bonds that had been called this is an additional risk to bbn as premium bonds that are called are only paid their par value blackrock reports that  of their bonds are callable in the next  years with a total of  of the bond portfolio subject to calls anytime in their lifetime conclusion bonds are complicated and closedend bond funds such as bbn even more so unfortunately mandatory disclosures by closedend funds are not particularly effective at communicating the risk characteristics of their portfolio in ways that are easily understood closedend bond funds disclose data on net asset value nav discount and distribution yield in fairly reliable and standardized formats however for closedend funds that specialize in bonds the disclosure about key variables of yield to maturity bond premium and duration has not been effectively standardized in the industry so it can be more challenging to understand the risk characteristics of the bond fund in the specific case of bbn the largest build america bond closedend mutual fund we can see that the reported yield to maturity is much higher than the weighted average yield to maturity of the individual bonds this is likely to do with how blackrock deals with leverage though i must admit that the specifics of their math escapes me in terms of what this means for my investment thesis on bbn i reiterate the views of my earlier article as follows builtin slow but steady drag on nav due to amortization of bond price premium price risk due to long duration and leverage no buffer from discount to nav and potential distribution cut due to rising shortterm borrowing rates this is a new bonus worry after my deepdive analysis now i want to make a point that i think that blackrock has done a fine job with the construction of bbns portfolio paying a manageable distribution from net investment income and providing pretty good information about the details of their portfolio i know because i owned bbn from late  to last week and received lots of high distributions started at almost  if i remember correctly and a capital gain of  as a nice bonus where there is room for improvement is for more disclosure on the bond premiums gross yield to maturity and duration before leverage and cost of leverage and hedging practices this information can provide more insight especially in markets where interest rate markets are starting to turn

only bonds deep valuesummaryblackrock taxable municipal bond trust is the largest closedend mutual fund specializing in build america bondspublic sources including cefconnect morningstar and blackrock have confusing data about key portfolio characteristics such as yield to maturity duration and bond pricei calculate the yield to maturity bond price and effective duration for each of the  bonds in bbns portfolio and provide a worksheetblackrock taxable municipal america bond trust bbn is the largest and highestyielding closedend mutual fund that specializes in build america bonds a special class of taxable municipal securities issued pursuant to the  american recovery and reinvestment act in an earlier article “build america bonds the impact of yield chasing” i warned about the potential risks to these funds due to low net asset value discount and high interest rate sensitivity in this article i show that for the average investor finding disclosure about some of the key bondrelated metrics can be confusing due to the rather limited and nonstandardized disclosures required of closedend bond funds so let’s see what different data sources report on key risk and yield metrics for bbn cefconnect and morningstar first let’s look at cefconnect under the tab “portfolio characteristics” it reports an average coupon of  average maturity of  years but sadly no ytm interestingly enough neither average coupon nor average maturity look right which we’ll get to later source cefconnect website next let’s try morningstar under the “portfolio” tab we can see a weighted average coupon of “” sorry folks no decimals reported here and weighted average bond price of  sadly there is no mention of yield to maturity for duration they report an unadjusted duration of  years and a leverage adjusted duration of  years so these are starting to look more plausible but let’s investigate further source morningstar blackrock blackrock provides a fact sheet and a website summary first at their website we found the following as of july  here they show ytm of  average coupon of  weighted average maturity of  years and effective duration of  years source blackrock website blackrock’s latest fact sheet is from march  and can be found at this link the second page shows portfolio characteristics including yield to maturity of  effective duration of  years and weighted average life wal to worst of  years it looks like they mistakenly labeled this as a percentage below is my summary of what the various data sources list for maturity duration and ytm source maturity nysey duration y ytm  coupon  bond price cefconnect   morningstar     blackrock website    blackrock factsheet    deep dive into bbn holdings after reading these different data sources something didn’t look right to me first cefconnect’s coupon looked too high in the  time period when the babs were being offered to the market most were paying coupons in the  to  range at issuance there were a few higher rate but those would not have been enough to move the average coupon over  second the yield to maturity looked high a quick scan of some build america bond cusips indicated that individual bond ytms were clustered in the high s to low s so i didn’t think that a weighted average portfolio of these type of bonds could reach  two phone calls to blackrock did not help clarify matters as the phone representatives read from a script along the lines of yield to maturity is calculated as the discount rate that sets the present value of the bond’s future cash flows equal to its market price for bonds that are callable we used the yield to worst i have to say they train them for consistency at blackrock as i got the same speech from both representatives unfortunately they were unable to answer questions about how a portfolio ytm could be higher than the component bond ytms so i decided to verify this for myself as the different data sources varied i figured the only way to convince myself of the ytm and duration was to look at each of the  individual holdings listed in their portfolio i used the latest semiannual report from january   as the main data source in that report they helpfully report details about the issuer coupon rate maturity par value and market value for each of the  distinct bond holdings in the bbn portfolio an example follows below source sample information from blackrock bbn semiannual report armed with this information one can calculate duration and ytm the bond’s yield to maturity can be calculated using excel’s yield function and the duration can be calculated using the mduration function so i entered all  holdings into excel and calculated the price ytm and duration for each of their holdings the results are pictured below and i make my excel sheet available on my onedrive source bbn semiannual report january   and author’s calculations using marketvaluebased weightings par value and duration weightings are very similar i get an average coupon of  wal of  years average bond price of  ytm of  and a duration of  years these numbers look more in line with the current prices and yields in the build america bond market analysis of bbn distributions the current gross income of the bbn portfolio is  million a year this is calculated using the average coupon rate of  times par value of  billion the net asset value is  billion  billion in gross market value less  million in shortterm loans which means the gross investment income yield is  management fees are  million  of nav and interest expense is running at about  million  of nav this results in net investment income of  million a year or about  which compares very favorably to the  distribution in their factsheet future amortization of premium due to the lower interest rate environment compared to  most of the bonds in bbn’s portfolio are selling at a premium i calculated a weighted average premium of  assuming that this premium is amortized over the weighted average life of  years this is an erosion of  in the gross bond value every year because of the  leverage this translates to a  a year decline in the nav as these bonds will trend towards par as they approach maturity interest rate risks and impact of leverage if the true ytm of the portfolio is  then this looks like a lowrisk and sustainable distribution but the portfolio is not really a  billion portfolio of bonds with a  ytm bbn is actually  billion of bonds with a  ytm and a  million loan which is currently costing them  consider a scenario where longterm rates stay the same so the value of the municipal bonds doesn’t change but shortterm cost of borrowing increases from  to  now the interest cost goes to  million or  of nav now the distributable net income rate is  this drop in income can happen in a situation where there is no change in longterm bond rates where all the rising rates are on nearterm debt illustration below finally let’s consider a case of a bp increase in longterm rates which leads to a decline in value of the overall bonds of  using my calculated  year duration in this illustration there is no change in income as the shortterm rates have been kept constant at  and only longterm rates increased by  leading to a price impact this leads to a  drop in the gross value of the portfolio which is a  drop in the nav call risk though i am not an expert on the call characteristics of the individual bonds in bbn’s portfolio a commenter on my other article pointed out several build america bonds that had been called this is an additional risk to bbn as premium bonds that are called are only paid their par value blackrock reports that  of their bonds are callable in the next  years with a total of  of the bond portfolio subject to calls anytime in their lifetime conclusion bonds are complicated and closedend bond funds such as bbn even more so unfortunately mandatory disclosures by closedend funds are not particularly effective at communicating the risk characteristics of their portfolio in ways that are easily understood closedend bond funds disclose data on net asset value nav discount and distribution yield in fairly reliable and standardized formats however for closedend funds that specialize in bonds the disclosure about key variables of yield to maturity bond premium and duration has not been effectively standardized in the industry so it can be more challenging to understand the risk characteristics of the bond fund in the specific case of bbn the largest build america bond closedend mutual fund we can see that the reported yield to maturity is much higher than the weighted average yield to maturity of the individual bonds this is likely to do with how blackrock deals with leverage though i must admit that the specifics of their math escapes me in terms of what this means for my investment thesis on bbn i reiterate the views of my earlier article as follows builtin slow but steady drag on nav due to amortization of bond price premium price risk due to long duration and leverage no buffer from discount to nav and potential distribution cut due to rising shortterm borrowing rates this is a new bonus worry after my deepdive analysis now i want to make a point that i think that blackrock has done a fine job with the construction of bbns portfolio paying a manageable distribution from net investment income and providing pretty good information about the details of their portfolio i know because i owned bbn from late  to last week and received lots of high distributions started at almost  if i remember correctly and a capital gain of  as a nice bonus where there is room for improvement is for more disclosure on the bond premiums gross yield to maturity and duration before leverage and cost of leverage and hedging practices this information can provide more insight especially in markets where interest rate markets are starting to turn

fmsbond  or email us state of munis if corporate tax rates were cut  if corporate tax rates were reduced to say  do you think the municipal bond market would be ok in terms of demand why did fed rates rise and muni rates ease  after the fed raised the benchmark lending rate by  last week why are municipal bond rates off  across all maturities and credit ratings an opportunity during muni redemptions  i have a laddered portfolio of california municipal bonds many of which were purchased in  at or around par most have coupon rates of  and are being redeemed this month in order to reinvest in similar munis i had to pay a  to  premium in your article “summer forecast a muni redemption flood supply drought” you said investors can often enhance their taxfree income when bonds are redeemed with regard to these  bonds i dont see how redemptions arent an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my taxfree income in the decreasingrate environment that has been in place for around  years shouldnt investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed why trust the muni bond rating agencies  moody’s and standard and poor’s proved their fallibility in  and beforetheir ratings are uselesswhy should i trust them now how can puerto rico bonds have aa rating  regarding your article bondholders after puerto rico’s bankruptcy filing i noticed you are still selling puerto rico bonds with an aa listingis there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones i ownhow do they get such a great rating determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond  in your recent article muni investors succeed by defying the odds you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first then yield how should i base my determination of quality ratings if so which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market what to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker  we have a “prudentinvestor” broker with another firm who put over  million into puerto rico bonds we almost killed him when we found out what he did now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return any advice we have about  million still invested we understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in puerto rico which is very slow to react premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal  i have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium if i buy for example a year facevalue muni bond with a  coupon for  par and pay a  premium over par i pay  to buy the bond when the bond matures i get back  and earn the stated yieldtomaturity when i purchased the bond assume that i can roll over a maturing  bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at  to obtain the  premium assume i go into my checking accountisnt the upfront  premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment that is isnt repayment of the  premium simply a return of my investment  not a return on my investment  medicare part b and taxexempt income  i can sign up for medicare soon and just learned that my rate for part b could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my taxexempt interest to my income this is very unfair has your company and others that sell bonds been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds  i live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments we have a  million bond portfolio that she manages she buys all fiveyear high yield  to  in todays  market munis with stiff premiums a recent purchase was a  par value  california muni with a fiveyear maturity we live in ca for which she paid over  the whole portfolio is like that please explain why she shouldnt buy premium bonds she wont listen to me or call me crazy and tell me its ok to rack up
