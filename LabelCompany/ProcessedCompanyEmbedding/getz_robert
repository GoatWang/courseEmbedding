losing myself and my brother in his original divorce my mother was horrible to my father and withheld us for child support more than anything else after my dad hired robert within a year we were living with my dad he made a miracle happen that my brother and i never thought would now i am  and own my own business robert has referred me to two attorneys who got the job done and made things happen just like he did thank you robertmore this review is from a person who hired this attorney hired attorney made my case a nightmare starposted by anonymous march  i hired this lawyer to help finish my divorcei was forced to terminate his services leaving me hi and dryhe lyed to me about the amount of money he was going to charge me to get my divorce finishedit actually ended up costing me three times what he originally told me to get me back to square onehe told me everything i wanted to hear and it wasnt until i lost that i realization came that he tells everyone what they want to hear before i fired him it appeared my exes attorney and him were good buddys dont hire this lawyermore this review is from a person who hired this attorney hired attorney robert norwood getz’s response “always interesting these negative reviews for fact patterns unknown to me or my staff appear just after i am successful with a particular case where custody is contested and i have had contempt found against the other parent twice”poor representation  starposted by anonymous january  took a pretty cut and dry case and turned it into a six hour mediation cost me almost as much money as my divorce to mediate a small section of my parenting plan against my wishes spent  of our time listening to personal stories that had no relevance to my case waste of my time and money more this review is from a person who hired this attorney hired attorney brilliant thorough absolutely recommended starsposted by anonymous december  bob was referred to me from another attorney who didnt have the time to take my case a difficult child custody situation bob was described as on the expensive side but tough as nails he is worth absolutely every last penny this man knows the ins and outs of family law he acts quickly is articulate and answers questions throughly his staff are also very well informed and amy his paralegal is one of the most kind people ive met now as a father i have primary custody of my son was able to take him to live with me out of state and the mother has to pay child support as well as all air travel there are plenty more favorable conditions for me that i know i have bob and amy to thank for the other party on the case has been known to be very petty and post false reviews just fyi they were convicted on a contempt of court charge on the st of january this year  and then somehow mysteriously he gets his first negative reviews immediately after also the other partys attorney did not show up for a hearing the irony of which does not escape me you cannot put a price on your children and for divorce cases paying a good lawyer up front could save you a lot of money in the longrun bob is definitely the guy youre looking formore this review is from a person who hired this attorney hired attorney great attorney  starsposted by chris december  i have had to use mr getzs services on several occasions and he has always been able to give me the

lawyermore robert norwood getz’s response “always interesting these negative reviews for fact patterns unknown to me or my staff appear just after i am successful with a particular case where custody is contested and i have had contempt found against the other parent twice”best interest at heart starsposted by destiny january  after being misrepresented and having poor representation in a divorce and custody battle i later found out that i was facing yet another battle the verbiage on my divorce decree was incorrect and was keeping me from receiving what what agreed upon i found bob to be willing to take on my case as well as extremely knowledgeable in the military requirements for retirement division bob and his team were always available to answer my questions were more than willing to provide more detailed explanation and approached my case in fairness for all parties involved never once approaching this in a greedy manner with their help we were able to reach the desired outcome with little time invested thank you bob and amy with all the support and assistance in handling my case quick and efficientlymore not interested in my case starposted by anonymous january  bob is one of those lawyers who struggles with his own moral conscious and he showed it during my case instance after instance he will use any tactic he can to get a leg up like telling the court anything they want to hear whether its true or not in my case he completely misrepresented me to the court by making up facts about my case that didnt even exist this was unacceptable one hearing he didnt even show up for it was clear that my whole case was about money for himmore robert norwood getz’s response “always interesting these negative reviews for fact patterns unknown to me or my staff appear

do lawyers do exactlylawyers also called attorneys or counsel serve as advocates for people and organizations they represent clients both to the court and to opposing parties lawyers can represent clients in criminal cases where a law has been broken and in civil cases in which one party is suing anotherlawyers are also important partners in situations that don’t involve the courtroom advising clients about their legal rights and obligations for personal or business issues they are trained to interpret complicated systems of laws and navigate the court systemwhat can a lawyer do for mefirst a lawyer will advise you as to whether or not you actually need legal help it’s not always obvious whether an issue is a legal matter or something that can be resolved without involving the court system a lawyer will help you answer these initial questionsonce you’ve decided to hire a lawyer then they have the power to represent you to the court and to opposing parties your lawyer is your most important ally in any legal matter they provide advice on how to proceed with your legal issue and prepare important documents for youif your issue involves going to court your lawyer will accompany you and can speak for you if your legal matter involves mediation or arbitration your lawyer will negotiate with the opposing party on your behalflets find your lawyerwhat type of lawyer do i needwhat practice area should i choosemany lawyers tend to focus only on one area or several related areas of law in your search for the right lawyer you should look for a lawyer who understands and has experience in the specific area of law for your issue for example a divorce lawyer may not be able to help you if you are considering declaring bankruptcy for your business but a bankruptcy lawyer who understands bankruptcy and business law would be a perfect match reputable lawyers will be upfront about their experience and specific focus but it will save you some time by narrowing your search beforehandtop  practice areas for avvo  attorneysavvo attorneys handle cases in over  practice areas including divorce criminal defense and bankruptcyfind the practice area that fits your issueis practice size and type something i should consider when i’m looking for a lawyerpractice size is definitely something you should take into account some firms consist of only one lawyer while some firms retain hundreds there are many different types of law firms some of which focus on very specific issues while others may be more general for instance a large corporate firm may not help if you only need a lawyer to review a contract or a few documents but may be the right choice if you are filing a personal injury suit against a large company if your legal issue involves only small sums of money or a few documents a small firm may be more costeffective the size of a practice may also determine how quickly you will be able to actually speak to your potential lawyer larger offices may require you to schedule your initial consultation through a lawyer’s assistant or secretarynumber of avvo attorneys who offer free consultationslets find your lawyerhow do i narrow the list of possible lawyers to contactshould location be a major factor in my search for a lawyerlocation is an important factor in looking for a lawyer to represent you since your issue will likely depend on state or local laws and regulations you will want an attorney who understands the regulations for your location on the practical side you will also want a lawyer who has an office that is convenient for you to travel to some lawyers are willing to travel to meet you but may also charge for travel time it’s usually a good idea to find a lawyer located in your geographical area besides legal knowledge of state and local laws lawyers also have practical local knowledge lawyers in specific cities or towns will also have connections to helpful agencies in that city which will expedite the process of resolving your issuewhat are other clients saying about themone of the best ways to know if an attorney is right for you are reviews read what previous clients have said about specific attorneys and their experiences once you choose an attorney to contact read all the reviews about that particular lawyer to get an idea of how they may handle your case and interact with youlets find your lawyerwhat fees and costs should i expectwhat types of payment do lawyers usually acceptmost lawyers accept standard payment methods such as cash check and credit cards sometimes the method of payment will involve part of the amount of a settlement so be sure to discuss payment options with your lawyer before signing a fee agreement most lawyers are also willing to set up a payment plan if necessarythe minimum rate for most attorneys is  per hourwhat is a fee agreementa fee agreement or representation agreement is a payment agreement between a lawyer and a client it can consist of several pages or simply one page outlining the agreement this document covers key issues such as how much you will be expected to pay for services rendered how the lawyer will be paid the timeline of
