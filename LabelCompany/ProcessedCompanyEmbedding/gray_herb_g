posted by reviewer on jul   this is not an easy to use product but it really did a nice job of covering the grey in the front of my hair i had been using surya and really loved the look and the ease of application but it began to take on a pink tone probably as my grey hair increased naturally its all in the front this product did a nice job of covering it without making it look pink but it is not that easy to apply i let the mixtures sit for  hours as one of the methods advised and the product was hard when it was time to apply i think adding a little water right before application might make application easier and still give good color i have reordered this product and am happy with the results but it is not an easy product to apply it is in powder form and must be mixed to use

verified purchase this henna is excellent and very effective especially for grays dont listen to those comments with no patience or intelligence to read the directionsit will take a long time so nuture yourself for a few hours and enjoy fantastic colorwith no toxic chemicals as you use henna your hair will become darker over a few days if you use lemon juice or another acidic such as vinegar

me and concerned about the carcinogenic effects of using hair color this is a good alternative it is a twostep process and you have to allow time for the henna to cure so it takes a little more time than regular coloring—so plan accordingly i did not have all the chemical residue from the last coloring out of my hair so the color came out with more gold tones that mahogany but still a nice color

making my gray hair look awesome because theres no way im dyeing it heres how i get beautiful gray hair with minimum care author elisabethlamar publish date january   tags tags conditioner shampoo vitamins gray hair going gray recently i had a chance to visit my grandmother and i was excited because i only see her about three times a year i was also eager to fill her in on an amazing trip i was about to embark on lobbying in washington dc grandmas response was whats wrong with your hair its so gray normally a comment like that would have me running straight for the henna powder but this time i chose to brush it off im embracing my changing body and the new hair color my head has decided to sprout i had been afraid of facing my roots but now im ready to tackle this phase of my life colortreated hair is a fine choice for many but for me its messy timeconsuming and expensive so what are some options for beautiful gray hair with minimum care use a shampoo that is formulated to boost shine which gray hair can often lack shikai color reflect platinum shampoo is a shampoo that minimizes yellow a huge problem for gray hair this product gives me crazy shine like my head could standin for the sun on cloudy days make friends with your conditioner consider it your bestie youre going to want to keep your hair supermoisturized gray hair has less of a protective cuticle who knew so strands can get coarser and tend to break more easily its crucial to keep that hair hydrated for optimal shape giovanni chic brazilian keratin  argan oil ultrasleek conditioner is a conditioner that fights frizz which can be a common issue for gray hair this formula is like a gift straight from the goddess apply a deep conditioning treatment to pump up shine and repair hair cuticles about once a week — or whenever you damn well please its your hair for petes sake i like vitamin e because we tend to have an abundance of it in my house at all times but coconut olive and avocado oils are all groovy choices too slather your head with the oil of your choosing slap a scarf on that noggin and go to sleep wake up wash it out and get ready for the gushing youll receive from strangers on the street add vitamins b and b — and oh yeah why not add a high quality fish oil while your at it — to your daily supplement regime because they are good for healthy hair growth try to stick with lightweight styling products because gray hair can take on a greasy look really quickly also avoid products containing alcohol which can be super drying to already fragile hair i like alba botanica strong hold style gel because its fragrancefree and the older i get the more artificial scents really bother me my nostrils have been assaulted enough in my lifetime thank you very much stay out of direct sunlight because it can make hair dulllooking but if you’re the outdoor type which is a really great song by the way wear a hat or a dramatic head wrap imagine youre little edie in grey gardens if your end goal is to stop dyeing your hair but youre really unhappy about the contrast between gray roots and your colortreated areas professionals recommend getting lowlights to help ease the transition alternatively you can shave your head or you can just not freak out about it and just let your hair be a few color different colors for a while think of it as your own personal rainbow have

plantbased colorants that will highlight darken lighten or cover the gray in your hair despite their versatility however herbal infusions cannot match the strength of commercial preparations and

dyestuff before applying it to your head since chemical residues left in your locks may make it impossible to predict the action of the natural treatment to perform the evaluation youll need to save some snips of hair from your next trim or cut a lock from the nape of your neck and prepare a small amount of whatever dye recipe you want to try following the instructions for that mixture apply it to a sample of hair then rinse the lock thoroughly and let it dry in direct sunlight if possible observe the result under strong natural light and if you want more or less color simply adjust the number of rinses andor the timing accordingly after a couple of trial runs you should be able to produce exactly the shade you wantread more here are several “prescriptions” that should serve at least to introduce you to the ancient science of herbal hair coloring these few formulas the possibilities are almost unlimited will allow you to produce some of the most frequently used natural rinses and dyes whether you’re fair or darkhaired you should be able to find something here that will give you attractive and safe results when you try it more fun for blonds chamomile is probably the most popular herbal hair colorant among blonds a weekly rinse with this herb tea will also remedy the brown streaking that results from overexposure to the sun and brighten “dishwater blond” hair to prepare a chamomile rinse steep half a cup of the flowers in a quart of boiling water for half an hour then strain the mixture and let it cool while you shampoo now pour the brew through your toweldried hair at least  times catching it in a basin each time in order to use it again wring the excess moisture out and leave the solution in your hair for a quarter of an hour before rinsing it out with clear water advertisement don’t limit your herbal experiments to chamomile however just about any yellowblossomed flower or herb can be used on blond hair including calendula it’s also called pot marigold mullein blooms and leaves yellow broom flowers saffron turmeric and quassia chips lemon is also a timehonored hair lightener the juice of two of the citrus fruits strained into a quart of water makes an excellent rinse that can be used in the same way as the chamomile preparation try to dry your hair in the sun after using a lemon rinse in order to get the most from the treatment’s lightening effect another native dye favored by blonds is prepared from rhubarb root and it’ll add attractive honey gold tones to light brown hair as well to put those glints in your locks pour three cups of hot water over four tablespoons of chopped rhubarb root and simmer the concoction for  minutes strain it pour it through your freshly shampooed hair  or more times rinse in clear water and again weather permitting dry it in the sun to strengthen the effect of the dyeing agent a bonus for brunets for over  years egyptians have used a dark powder made from the henna shrub to give their hair and beards an auburn tint nowadays you can buy henna powder from many herb supply houses and some health food stores and coops it’s known as a safe healthful dye and — since it coats the cuticle layer of each strand — it’ll actually make your hair feel thicker however be warned that henna tends to produce an almost brassy orangered shade when used alone so it’s best to mix it with a “lighter” herb like chamomile since it is so strong henna shouldn’t be used at all by persons with white gray or very light blond hair always try a timed test swatch first too otherwise you might end up with an unexpectedly bizarre orange head if you’d like to mix up my favorite recipe i’ve found that it puts pretty reddish gold highlights in my dark mane measure one part of powdered chamomile and two parts of powdered henna into a nonmetal bowl then add enough boiling water to make a thick paste stir in a tablespoon of vinegar which will help release the plants’ colors and let the blend cool for a few minutes advertisement when the paste is lukewarm put on a pair of rubber gloves henna can stain your palms and fingernails too and massage it into your clean wet hair comb it through with a widetoothed comb to insure even distribution of the dye next pile up your hair fit a plastic bag over it and wrap a heavy towel around your head to hold in the heat you’ll need to leave the dye and towel turban in place for anywhere from  minutes to two hours the darker your natural hair is the longer youll have to wait for the hennachamomile to take effect when the time is up remove the towel and bag and rinse your hair until the water comes clean then allow the newly colored tresses to airdry as usual in the sunshine if possible any stains that the dye might leave on your hands or around your hairline can be removed with a little elbow grease and lemon juice should you prefer a simpler and sloweracting procedure you can make a weaker solution of the herbs and use it as you would any of the previous color rinses just mix together one tablespoon each of henna chamomile and vinegar then steep them in a quart of boiling water for  minutes naturally you should cool and strain the liquid before using it some “sage” advice of coursedarkerhaired beauties sometimes need to enhance the color of their locks too and sage is one of the oldest and most effective colorants for use on dark brown or black hair a rinse made from sage leaves can be used to deepen any brunet shade and it’ll also effectively cover gray in dark hair a sage rinse can be made by steeping a handful of the dried herb in a quart of boiling water for  minutes longer if you want a darker tint cool the infusion strain it and pour it through freshly shampooed hair  or more times then wait  minutes before washing the liquid out with clear water because a sage rinse is a progressive dye you’ll have to apply it weekly until you produce the shade you want and then continue using it once a month to maintain that color tag alder bark is another popular hairdarkening botanical but it generally produces a lighter tone than sage so it’s best when used to darken blond hair or to cover gray in locks that are light to medium brown to make a tag alder rinse simmer an ounce of bark chips your health food store can likely order them from an herb supply firm in a quart of water for about half an hour then cool and use it exactly as you would the sage rinse i’ve already described a very dark sablecolored dye can be obtained from walnut hulls but this one is tricky since the nuts’ outer casings tend to stain everything they touch for that reason i recommend that you wear gloves throughout all stages of the process and avoid rubbing the mixture into your scalp to prepare the dark juice first crush the hulls in a mortar cover them with boiling water and a pinch of salt and let them “soak” for three days then add three cups of boiling water and simmer the hulls in a nonmetal container for five hours replacing the water as it steams away strain off the liquid place the walnut hulls in a cloth sack and twist it tightly to wring out all remaining juice finally return the expressed liquid to the pot and reduce it by boiling to about a quarter of its original volume the resulting brew can then be used to whip up a rich walnut dye as follows add a teaspoon of ground cloves or allspice to the prepared extract allow the dye mixture to steep in the refrigerator for about a week shaking it frequently during that time when it’s ready for use strain the liquid using a piece of cheesecloth and pour it at least  times through freshly shampooed hair before rinsing it out thoroughly by experimenting with the formulas contained in this article you’ll be well on your way to achieving just about any hair shade you’d like without resorting to expensive unsafe chemical dyes soon you should be able to experience the same pleasure i feel when dyeing my tresses with herbs i know — while doing so — that i’m not only saving money by using easily gathered materials but also protecting the health of my locks if you experiment a little you can have fun coloring your hair too

hairdyecolorukwordpresscom pika   am hennaindigo are the best it does no damage to the hair i use rainbow henna available at healthfood stores or online that is a mix of henna and other herbs such as indigo chamomile etc it makes my hair so soft and shiny it works just as well as regular hair dyes but does not kill the hair i do have some greys but i mix mine with black coffee apple cider vinegar

you are correct there is no such thing as black henna the powders and dyes sold as black henna usually have some nasty toxic chemicals in them there is also no clear henna henna is red and thats it you can modify the color with other herbs and extracts to get a true black hair dye you do a base layer of henna and then another dye session using indigo it gives a very nice natural black i have to disagree with the author on henna i have been using it since i was a teenager i am  now i have a lot of gray in my hair and henna covers it beautifully henna is brassy the first couple of days after dyeing but it oxidizes to a more muted and natural shade very quickly henna also applies better as an acid dye human hair is like wool and other protien fibers i mix mine with straight lemon juice and a little bit of coconut oil for extra conditioning there is no need to heat anything just let it sit covered for about  hours to get the best dye release you can modify henna by making a strong tea of rose hips or mexican saffron you still use the lemon juice as the main liquid though beet juice cherries and red wine have all produced nice results too the longer you leave a henna dye on the more intense the color i put a plastic shopping bag over my hair and cover it all up with a bandana and sleep on it there are some great resources on the web and tons of photos of the varying shades you can achieve with henna mixed with other natural ingredients eoz   pm tips for walnut dying after making the walnut juice simmering straining etc boil it down for another  minutes to thicken it add a tsp of corn starch predissolved in a tbsp of cold water you can then mix the room temp  cold dying liquid in with a blended avocado or a whipped egg white or honey and oil or thick conditioner or full fat mayo this will make it way easier to apply and its so good for your hair and it will give you a few seconds to wipe it off before your skin before it stains pure liquid stains much more quickly use a squirt bottle to access the back of your head without drips cover your head with a bag after and gently blow dry your head dont melt the bag  the heat will help the dying the process and while you can use just about any part of the walnut the husks are the best you can get these for free outside in the fall if you know where to look youll want to use  walnut husks per dye application depending on the size of the husks how finely you crush them and how much hair you have freeze extra hulls for use during the rest of the year dont forget to eat the walnuts after hulling let them dry for a month in an old onion bag and then crack with a hammer teresa neville   am has anyone tried any other type flowerplant on dark hair that is that is about  gray i am interested in the results im

what you are speaking of is paraphenylenediamine ppd an amine compound used in many hair dyes that can cause serious reactions the term black henna refers to something that doesnt exist henna strictly imparts a red tone to hair any other color indicates there are other compounds added to the dye see this site for more information httpwwwhennaforhaircomppdindexhtml there are natural and safe ways to obtain brown or black hair through various mixes of henna and indigo plants which are also listed on the above site in greater detail httpwwwhennaforhaircommixesindexhtml good luck faith rosenquist   am i really enjoyed the natural hair colorant article and just have one concern based on rumors about black henna having dangerous compounds in it that leach into your body and cause some type of permanent damage to it this info came from a doctor that investigates ingredients in cosmetics and body care products i used to use a henna with a black base pretty frequently as i wanted ash not black but light brown without the traditional red tones color i stopped after reading the article by a dr christine  as she seemed sincere and quite knowledgeable since painting the hands with henna is popular and black is often used i would like to hear more about this as i am sure most people are unaware of any dangers here we should remember that just because a product is plant based does not mean that it may not have poisonous side effects chiles rellenos recipe natural cooling methods how to keep cool without air conditioning mortgagefree living on a mountain yearround gardening tips for

with this herb july  share title gray hair regains color and teeth whiten with this herb url httpswwwdherbscomarticlesgrayhairregainscolorandteethwhitenwiththisherb a sign of both aging and stress gray hair can be a sore subject some people don’t mind it and embrace the salt and pepper look while others do everything they can to keep the color alive if you want to help your graying hair regain its natural color we have the plant for you you won’t have to resort to chemical dyes and other hair products sage is an ancient healing herb that has been used for thousands of years people used to use it to help relieve gastric pain but it has also been used to stop bleeding or as a natural disinfectant like the saying “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” there is a saying about sage that goes “who has sage in the garden does not need a doctor” a sage plant in your garden works as a natural insect repellent keeping your carrots cabbage strawberries tomatoes and marjoram fresh since dried sage leaves are fairly common you can put them in your closet to keep it insect free you can also use sage essential oil to make diy cosmetic products sage leaves are commonly used in cooking and burning the dried leaves is a great way to make your house smell amazing to keep the gray away you have to make a natural solution that you’ll rinse through your hair first put  tablespoons of crushed soaked sage in a half liter of water let that sit for  hours and then strain the liquid into a large pitcher don’t throw that crushed sage away because you are going to boil it in another half liter of water leave it boiling for five minutes and then remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool strain the liquid into the pitcher with the other sage water how to use after washing your hair with a natural shampoo rinse it with two cups of the sage solution this will help restore your hair’s original color if you have very dark or black hair prepare the same solution but use equal parts sage and black tea for best results you can consume  cup of this mixture a day or use  cups as a natural rinse to whiten your teeth you can rub fresh sage leaves on your teeth you can also rinse your mouth with lukewarm sage tea to help prevent cavities rinsing with sage tea also helps to naturally freshen your breath sourcehttpgoldenhealthylifecomindexphpsagegrayhairregainscolorteethbecomewhiterdiscoverbeautyrecipesbehindplanttdherbstags beautybeauty tipsdiygray hairhairhair

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first

position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting both for location and for devices computer mobile and tablet make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid that would lower your costperclick and help stretch your budget how do i
