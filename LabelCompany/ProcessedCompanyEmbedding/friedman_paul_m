choose the right skin care product published  by ines markovic in skin care how many times did you find yourself in a drugstore or surfing the internet in search of a skin care product and after buying and trying it you realized that your skin doesnt like it to avoid that from happening once again read dr paul friedmans useful advices on how to pick the right skin care productaccording to dermatologist dr paul friedman “the skin care market is full of products that can help improve challenged skin but many of my patients experience frustration with an oversaturated beauty market” here are some of the most common “beauty blunders” when it comes to buying and using consumer skin care products if you have acneprone skin avoid buying lotions that come in a jar or pot says dr friedman dipping your fingers into lotions every day introduces bacteria to the entire jar and that can translate onto your skin causing breakouts or infections ask for recommendations but proceed with caution the old adage went if you see a woman with great hair ask where she had it done the same can be applied to skin care – ask a friend what kind of moisturizer she likes and you might find your new favorite product but keep in mind skin care is a unique experience what works for some does not work for all if you are buying environmentally friendly products watch out for those that are “paraben free” parabens have been singled out as potentially dangerous chemicals but what most consumers don’t know is they are included in skincare items for a reason – to help them last longer most parabenfree products will spoil after a certain timeframe which is usually listed on the package pay attention to this date and treat it almost like a food item says dr friedman you don’t need an “arsenal” of products to look your best many skin care companies sell their products in a series or grouping according to dr friedman most women only need a gentle cleanser daily moisturizer with spf of  or higher and a moisturerich night cream to maintain a healthy complexion read the back of the labels many products contain irritants like added fragrances or alcohols that can dry the skin no matter what a package promises on the front read the back carefully to ensure you are getting what’s advertised if you have skin sensitivities towards certain foods it is also important to look for essential oils which are often derived from foods that can cause allergies in some people don’t be fooled by clever marketing terminology product packaging is usually designed to do one thing sell the product dr friedman says the last thing you should look for in a product is an appealing design be wary of claims like “dermatologist tested” or “allergy tested” these phrases often carry little meaning watch where you store your skin care different types of products such as gels may have temperature requirements in order to stay effective notes dr friedman leaving products in direct sunlight in extreme heat or cold could also affect their performance if there are no directions dr friedman notes products should be kept in cool dry areasand remember the more you educate yourself the better your chances are of finding a skin care routine that works for you about dr paul friedmanpaul m friedman md is boardcertified by the american board of dermatology specializing in dermatologic laser
