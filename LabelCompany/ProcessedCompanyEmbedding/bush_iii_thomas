appeals� affirmed�   ����� louis b butler jr j�� thomas h bush seeks review of a published court of appeals decision that affirmed a circuit courts order denying two pretrial motions challenging the constitutionality of wis stat ch  chapter  �� state v bush  wi app   wis d   nwd  bush iii� the court of appeals concluded that bush was procedurally barred from raising a constitutional challenge against chapter � id � ����� bush asks this court to reverse the court of appeals decision and hold that he is not procedurally barred from bringing this constitutional claim� bush further asks this court to conclude that chapter  is facially unconstitutional on substantive due process grounds in that it does not require proof of a recent overt act when there has been a break in the offenders incarceration and the offender has been reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior ����� although the state argues that bush has waived the issue regarding his constitutional challenge to chapter  we reach the issues merits� we conclude that due process does not require a showing of a recent overt act when there is a break in the offenders incarceration and the offender is subsequently reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior in order to prove current dangerousness� we decline to adopt a brightline rule that requires current dangerousness to be proven by a particular type of evidence� accordingly we affirm the decision of the court of appeals i ����� the following facts are undisputed and were stipulated to by the parties at trial mr bush was convicted in  of attempted second degree sexual assault which the state maintains is the predicate act authorizing the filing of the original petition for a chapter  commitment� subsequent to his  conviction mr bush was paroled and was permitted to leave the state of wisconsin in � he was arrested in  for operating under the influence but was acquitted of that charge� as a direct result of his arrest for the operating under the influence charge he was returned to the state of wisconsin to face revocation proceedings� ultimately he was revoked as a result of drinking related events� at no time was he charged with any new sexually violent offense after the  assault� his revocation was as a consequence to nonsexually assaultive behavior� these violations did not constitute recent overt acts of sexual violence� no evidence was provided in the petition to reflect that the respondent committed any recent overt act nor was any evidence consistent with a recent overt act introduced at the time of the probable cause hearing� ����� the following additional facts are also helpful for our analysis� when bush was arrested for attempted seconddegree sexual assault in  he had been placed on parole just  days prior for a conviction of attempted firstdegree sexual assault� prior to his  conviction bush was convicted of numerous sexrelated offenses which include two counts of sexual assault three counts of sexual perversion three counts of disorderly conduct including a peeping tom offense two counts of seconddegree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of attempted sexual assault� by  bush had been incarcerated or under probation and parole community supervision almost continuously in illinois michigan minnesota and wisconsin since his first conviction in � aside from these convictions bush admitted committing other deviant sexual behavior than that for which he had been arrested� ����� in  while serving the sentence for his  conviction bush completed the oshkosh sex offender treatment program� he was placed on parole to attend the behavioral medicine institute of atlanta georgia� he successfully completed the inpatient component of the georgia program but failed to comply with the requirements of the outpatient program in violation of the conditions of his parole by purchasing a sports car without knowledge or permission of the program drinking alcohol and getting in a car accident� his parole was revoked and he was incarcerated again in wisconsin ����� in addition to bushs prior convictions since at least  bushs psychiatric evaluations have expressed the opinion that bush is among those sexual offenders who are the least likely to change their behavior� more recent evaluations conducted in  and  recommended that bush be closely supervised and identified bush as posing a high risk of recidivism despite his extensive participation in sexoffender treatment� furthermore while incarcerated bush continued to demonstrate behavior that is predictive of the likelihood that he will reoffend� for example bush was reprimanded in  for attempting to purchase pornography and for corresponding by mail with a person who was engaged in grooming a boy for sexual purposes� ����� in  while bush remained incarcerated for his  offense the state filed a chapter  petition alleging that bush was still sexually violent� see bush iii  wis d  � see also state v bush no ap unpublished slip op wis ct app dec   bush i� following the trial on that petition the jury found that bush was sexually violent� see bush iii  wis d  �� bush appealed and the court of appeals reversed his commitment because of a prejudicial jury instruction� id ����� in  bush was retried and a second jury came to the same conclusion� id �� bush again appealed arguing that�  the states expert witnesses should have been disqualified  the state failed to present sufficient evidence to meet chapter s requirements and  the state failed to file the petition within the requisite  days� state v bush no ap unpublished slip op at � wis ct app nov   bush ii� the court of appeals affirmed in all respects except whether the state had filed the chapter  petition in a timely manner� see bush iii  wis d  �� on remand the trial court determined that the state had complied with the filing requirements of chapter � id � ����� in august  bush filed a petition for release under wis stat � � bush iii  wis d  �� in the pretrial motions bush argued in pertinent part that he had been denied due process because chapter  failed to require proof of a recent overt act� id� the circuit court for eau claire county honorable william m gabler denied bushs pretrial motions and a jury determined that bush was still sexually violent� id �� his petition for discharge was therefore denied� id ����� bush again appealed renewing his argument he made for the first time in the circuit court that chapter  is unconstitutional because it does not require a recent overt act� the state argued that bush should not be allowed to attack the underlying commitment on constitutional grounds because he should have made this challenge in his two prior appeals� id �� the court of appeals agreed with the state and concluded that bush was procedurally barred from raising the issue of the constitutionality of chapter � id ��  ����� bush seeks review and we affirm� ii ����� bush challenges the constitutionality of chapter  on due process grounds alleging that the statute fails to require a finding of a recent overt act� the constitutionality of a statute is a question of law which we review de novo� state v randall  wis d    nwd  � this court has already determined that the state has dual interests under the statute to protect the public from the dangerously mentally disordered and to provide care and treatment to those with mental disorders that predispose them to sexual violence� state v post  wis d    nwd  � the supreme court has recognized both of these interests as legitimate the first under a states police powers and the latter under its parens patriae powers� id citing addington v texas  us   � thus the issue is whether chapter  is narrowly tailored under the circumstances in this case to serve these compelling state interests� id� iii ����� before addressing the merits of bushs argument we first address a procedural issue� relying on state v trochinski  wi   wis d   nwd  state v molitor  wis d   nwd  ct app  and state ex rel skinkis v treffert  wis d   nwd  ct app  bush asserts that facial challenges to the constitutionality of a statute present issues of subject matter jurisdiction which cannot be waived notwithstanding his failure to raise that challenge in his earlier appeals� ����� the state on the other hand argues that the law in this area lacks clarity and is inconsistent� while the state recognizes the validity of those cases relied upon by bush it nevertheless suggests that those cases have not always been followed� moreover the state argues that another line of cases culminating in this courts decision last term in village of trempealeau v mikrut  wi  ��   wis d   nwd  suggest that pursuant to article vii section  of the wisconsin constitution no circuit court is without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain actions of any nature whatsoever� mikrut  wis d  � see mueller v brunn  wis d    nwd   eberhardy v cir ct for wood co  wis d   nwd   ����� we agree with the state that the jurisprudence concerning subject matter jurisdiction and a circuit courts competence to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction is murky at best� nevertheless we have recently resolved this area as bush suggests and we reaffirm those decisions here� ����� in both state v cole  wi  �  wis d   nwd  and trochinski  wis d  � n this court concluded that while an as applied challenge to the constitutionality of a statute may be waived a facial challenge is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction and cannot be waived� the logic behind this conclusion is entirely consistent with article vii section  of the wisconsin constitution� article vii section  states that except as otherwise provided by law circuit courts have original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal� if a statute is unconstitutional on its face any action premised upon that statute fails to present any civil or criminal matter in the first instance� as the court of appeals correctly noted in skinkis if the facial attack on the statute were correct the statute would be null and void and the court would be without the power to act under the statute� skinkis  wis d at � this is contrasted from an as applied challenge where the court initially has jurisdiction over the subject matter as the statute is valid upon its face� ����� this rule is also entirely consistent with our line of cases that recognize that a criminal complaint which fails to allege any offense known at law is jurisdictionally defective and void� see champlain v state  wis d    nwd   state v lampe  wis d    nwd  � once again the premise behind the rule is simple� circuit courts have original jurisdiction over all matters civil and criminal except as otherwise provided by law� if a complaint fails to state an offense known at law no matter civil or criminal is before the court resulting in the court being without jurisdiction in the first instance��� ����� we conclude that because bush has facially challenged the constitutionality of chapter  his challenge goes to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court� therefore because challenges to subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived we reach the merits of his claim iv ����� we now consider the substance of bushs argument� chapter  applies only if an offender is a sexually violent person� wisconsin stat �  defines a sexually violent person as follows sexually violent person means a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense has been adjudicated delinquent for a sexually violent offense or has been found not guilty of or not responsible for a sexually violent offense by reason of insanity or mental disease defect or illness and who is dangerous because he or she suffers from a mental disorder that makes it likely that the person will engage in acts of sexual violence� emphasis added ����� bush argues that wis stat chapter  is facially unconstitutional because it does not require a showing of a recent overt act to prove that an offender is currently dangerous� specifically bush contends that chapter  violates due process because it fails to require a showing of a recent overt act to prove current dangerousness when there has been a break in the offenders incarceration and the offender has been reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior� ����� bush asks this court to adopt the rationale used by the washington supreme court in in re albrecht  pd  wash � in that case the washington supreme court concluded that when an offender has been released into the community and his or her release is revoked for a nonsexually violent act due process requires that the state show a recent overt act by the offender� albrecht  pd at  see also in re young  pd   wash � the washington supreme court reasoned that the constitutionality of an involuntary civil commitment is predicated on proof that the offender is dangerous and that his or her dangerousness is current� albrecht  pd at  citing foucha v louisiana  us   � once an offender has been released into the community and is later incarcerated for a nonsexually violent offense the offender cannot necessarily be said to be currently dangerous� id at � therefore when an offender has been released into the community due process is violated if the state has not demonstrated that the offender is currently dangerous and the offenders current dangerousness must be demonstrated by a recent overt act� id at  citing young  pd at � the washington court stated the existence of a recent overt act    necessarily satisfies the dangerousness element required by due process because the recent overt act requirement directly and specifically speaks to a persons dangerousness� id at � ����� we decline to adopt albrecht� bushs argument rooted in the albrecht rationale raises three problems� first bushs entire due process argument assumes that the mere fact that an offender has been granted parole constitutes a determination that the offender is no longer dangerous� second bush asks this court to adopt an absolute brightline rule that specifies the particular evidence that will adequately show current dangerousness limiting the factfinders ability to determine the offenders current level of dangerousness� third bush advocates an illogical standard by urging that this court require proof of a recent overt act while defining recent as the period of time when the offender is in the community regardless of the passage of time between the parole revocation and the filing of the involuntary civil commitment petition� we discuss each issue in turn a ����� at the outset bushs entire argument rests on the assumption that the parole board must have determined that bush was no longer dangerous when it granted him parole in  ���bush asserts that the parole board would not have released him into the community on supervised parole if the board believed he was dangerous� once the state presumably determined that bush was no longer dangerous and released him into the community bush reasons due process requires the state prove he had become dangerous subsequent to his release by showing a recent overt act� ����� the state contends that this rationale is unpersuasive because nothing in the record demonstrates why bush was released on supervised parole� ����� as both parties correctly observe the record is terse as to why bush was paroled or on what basis that decision was made� in fact the evidence contained in the record could lead to contradictory conclusions as to the parole boards rationale� on one hand the record indicates that prior to his  parole bush had made excellent progress with his sexoffender treatment had become a low risk to society and was not dangerous to others� this evidence may have led to the conclusion that bush was no longer dangerous� ����� on the other hand bush was allowed to leave prison on supervised release in order to attend the behavioral medicine institute of atlanta georgia� according to the record the atlanta program is an advanced sexoffender treatment program that treats the most chronic of cases and those that have proven unresponsive to previous treatments� in addition the state imposed specific conditions of release upon bush� as such evidence in the record also supports a determination that bush remained dangerous ����� therefore we cannot conclude that the mere fact that the state granted bush parole necessarily leads to the conclusion that he was no longer dangerous as that concept is used in chapter � the record is simply too barren for us to agree with that conclusion� although the fact that the state placed bush on supervised parole has probative value in undercutting the states case it is not a conclusive determination of bushs dangerousness under chapter  b ����� bush advocates that we adopt a brightline rule that requires a showing that he committed a recent overt act while on parole regardless of any of his sexually violent behavior before or after the period of time he was on supervised parole in � we agree with the state that due process does not require adoption of this brightline rule ����� we recognize that substantive as well as procedural limitations on a states power to commit the dangerously mentally ill vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction� post  wis d at  citing jackson v indiana  us   � as such the united states supreme court has refused to proscribe strict boundaries for legislative determinations of what is necessary for voluntary commitment� id� ����� moreover the court has cautioned that an absolutist approach is unworkable in a civil commitment analysis� kansas v crane  us   � the court concluded that the constitutions safeguards of human liberty in the area of mental illness and the law are not always best enforced through precise brightline rules� crane  us at  citing kansas v hendricks  us   � brightline rules present unworkable standards because their rigidity hampers the factfinders ability to measure an individuals dangerousness� see state v laxton  wi  �  wis d   nwd  ����� along similar lines inhibiting a factfinders evaluation of dangerousness through brightline rules is problematic because chapter  is reserved for only the most dangerous offenders� see post  wis d at � prior to commitment chapter  requires the state to present evidence sufficient to allow the factfinder to distinguish a dangerous sexual offender who has serious difficulty controlling his or her behavior from a dangerous but typical recidivist� laxton  wis d  �� this evaluation is not an exact science the standard risk assessment used by expert witnesses for sexual offenders takes into account all past violations of the law in attempting to evaluate the probability of future sexually assaultive behavior� state v franklin  wi  �  wis d   nwd � ����� predicting an offenders dangerousness under chapter  is a complex evaluation� at trial the factfinder is obligated to examine the totality of the offenders past actions and make a determination based on the offenders relevant character traits and patterns of behavior as to whether the offenders mental condition currently predisposes him or her to commit another sexually violent act� id � holding that wis stat �  did not apply to chapter  state v kienitz  wis d    nwd   reasoning that the factfinder has an obligation to weigh all the evidence presented� ultimately the question is simply whether it is substantially probable that the person will engage in acts of sexual violence without regard to any specific restrictions supervision or time frame� see state v thiel  wi app  �  wis d   nwd � thus we agree with the state that due process does not require that an evaluation of dangerousness be limited based on bushs proposed brightline rule c ����� finally we agree with the state that bush advocates an illogical application of requiring recent overt acts to prove current dangerousness� bush defines recent overt acts as including acts during the time he was on parole which in this case was five years before the state filed the initial petition� his rationale is again based on albrecht where the washington court found that to determine the offenders level of current dangerousness the factfinder must rely on an offenders behavior when he or she is not incarcerated� albrecht  pd at � when an individual is continuously incarcerated the only behavior available to the factfinder is his or her behavior prior to incarceration� id� but under albrecht when the offender has been released back into the community his or her behavior upon release is demonstrative of whether the offender continues to be dangerous� id� ����� looking to bushs time on parole without more does not necessarily give the factfinder an adequate evaluation of bushs current dangerousness for at least three reasons� ����� first bushs parole was not close in time to his chapter  trial� bush was released into the community under supervised parole in early � in less than a month he violated specific conditions of his parole and was reincarcerated for his  offense� five years later the state filed a petition to commit bush under chapter � bush asks this court to conclude that his behavior while on parole in  should be the only reliable evidence for the factfinder to use in determining whether he was currently dangerous in � his conduct during his parole merely establishes that he had difficulty in conforming his behavior to the law during his short release period ����� second under bushs approach an offenders behavior while incarcerated would be irrelevant to support a determination of current dangerousness� however the factfinders analysis of an offenders current dangerousness is not limited to the offenders actions prior to his or her most recent incarceration and can include an offenders actions while incarcerated� see franklin  wis d  � state v zanelli  wis d    nwd  ct app �� here bush has engaged in the following behavior while incarcerated� he was reprimanded for corresponding with a person who was grooming a boy for sexual purposes and he attempted to obtain pornographic materials� this behavior may bear on bushs dangerousness but the weight to be given to this behavior is for the factfinder ����� third the sexually violent offense for which bush is incarcerated may be relevant evidence of current dangerousness� bush was eligible for a chapter  commitment only because he had been convicted of a sexrelated crime� the fact that bush was incarcerated for attempted sexual assault when the chapter  petition was filed is evidence of his dangerousness at that time� although this conviction on its face is not sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the person has a mental disorder as required for a chapter  commitment wis stat �  we conclude that evidence of bushs  conviction is a proper component of the evaluation of his current dangerousness ����� therefore we conclude that due process does not require a showing of a recent overt act to prove current dangerousness when there has been a break in the offenders incarceration and the offender has been reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior� because due process does not require this showing under these circumstances we agree with the state that chapter  is accordingly narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest for purposes of bushs challenge� therefore we reject bushs argument that chapter  is facially unconstitutional on that basis� v ����� in sum we conclude that chapter  is not facially unconstitutional� we conclude that due process does not require proof of a recent overt act in evaluating the dangerousness of the offender when there has been a break in the offenders incarceration and the offender is reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior� substantive due process allows for a chapter  commitment when there is sufficient evidence of current dangerousness� we decline to adopt any brightline rule that requires current dangerousness to be proven by a particular type of evidence� ���� by the court�the decision of the court of appeals is affirmed              all references to the wisconsin statutes are to the  version unless otherwise indicated�  as seen below bush has had two commitment hearings one in  and another in � the current appellate record does not contain the trial transcripts from the  commitment hearing� although we do have the exhibits and a list of which exhibits were admitted at trial we do not know if any of the exhibits were admitted for limited purposes� we will assume that they were not� further we do not know if any exhibits from the prior commitment hearing in  were incorporated by reference during the  commitment hearing� as they are part of our record here we will assume that they were� see state v mcattee  wi app  � n  wis d   nwd  it is the appellants responsibility to ensure completion of the appellate record and when an appellate record is incomplete in connection with an issue raised by the appellant we must assume that the missing material supports the trial courts ruling� citation and quotations omitted  although driving while intoxicated does not necessarily raise concerns for sexually violent behavior drinking and driving are a particularly dangerous combination for bush� the record demonstrates that mr bush has specific triggers regarding his sex offender criminal activity which includes alcohol and fast cars�  wisconsin stat �  outlines the procedures for filing a petition alleging an offender is a sexually violent person as follows � a petition filed under this section shall allege that all of the following apply to the person alleged to be a sexually violent person a the person satisfies any of the following criteria  the person has been convicted of a sexually violent offense  the person has been found delinquent for a sexually violent offense  the person has been found not guilty of a sexually violent offense by reason of mental disease or defect ag the person is within  days of discharge or release on parole extended supervision or otherwise from a sentence that was imposed for a conviction for a sexually violent offense from a secured correctional facility as defined in s  m from a secured child caring institution as defined in s  g or from a secured group home as defined in s  p if the person was placed in the facility for being adjudicated delinquent under s  or  on the basis of a sexually violent offense or from a commitment order that was entered as a result of a sexually violent offense b the person has a mental disorder c the person is dangerous to others because the persons mental disorder makes it likely that he or she will engage in acts of sexual violence  wisconsin stat �  reads as follows a a person may petition the committing court for discharge from custody or supervision without the secretarys approval� at the time of an examination under s   the secretary shall provide the committed person with a written notice of the persons right to petition the court for discharge over the secretarys objection� the notice shall contain a waiver of rights� the secretary shall forward the notice and waiver form to the court with the report of the departments examination under s � if the person does not affirmatively waive the right to petition the court shall set a probable cause hearing to determine whether facts exist that warrant a hearing on whether the person is still a sexually violent person� the committed person has a right to have an attorney represent him or her at the probable cause hearing but the person is not entitled to be present at the probable cause hearing � b if the court determines at the probable cause hearing under par a that probable cause exists to believe that the committed person is no longer a sexually violent person then the court shall set a hearing on the issue� at a hearing under this paragraph the committed person is entitled to be present and to the benefit of the protections afforded to the person under s � the district attorney or the department of justice whichever filed the original petition shall represent the state at a hearing under this paragraph� the hearing under this paragraph shall be to the court� the state has the right to have the committed person evaluated by experts chosen by the state� at the hearing the state has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the committed person is still a sexually violent person � c if the court is satisfied that the state has not met its burden of proof under par b the person shall be discharged from the custody or supervision of the department� if the court is satisfied that the state has met its burden of proof under par b the court may proceed to determine using the criteria specified in s  b whether to modify the persons existing commitment order by authorizing supervised release  see state v wilks  wis d    nwd   where court declined to address defendants claim that loitering ordinance was unconstitutionally vague when raised for first time on appeal in re baby girl k  wis d    nwd   where court considered facial constitutional challenge raised for first time on appeal as discretionary but to be done if in best interests of justice and sambs v city of brookfield  wis d    nwd   court declined to reach claim presented for first time on appeal that liability limits are unconstitutional although it is not clear whether that challenge was facial or as applied� see also state v thomas  wis d    nwd  ct app  facial challenges that a statute is unconstitutionally vague go to subject matter jurisdiction  under the wisconsin constitution except as otherwise provided by law the circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal within this state    � wis const art vii � �  common law principles of waiver generally apply to bushs as applied constitutional challenge� see state v erickson  wis d    nwd   noting that the waiver rule exists to promote efficiency and fairness see also state v cole  wi  �  wis d   nwd  and state v trochinski  wi  � n  wis d   nwd � because bush failed to raise this issue in his earlier appeals and because we do not have all components of the record we conclude that bush has waived his as applied challenge� however we decline to reach the question of whether a procedural bar similar to one announced in state v escalonanaranjo  wis d   nwd   applies  according to the washington court a recent overt act is any act that has either caused harm of a sexually violent nature or creates a reasonable apprehension of such harm� in re albrecht  pd   wash � when the individual has been continuously incarcerated no evidence of a recent overt act is required because that would create an impossible standard� id at   in in re young  pd   wash  the washington supreme court held that when an offender has been released from confinement since his or her last sex offense but before sexually violent predator proceedings are initiated against him or her the state had to prove he or she committed a recent overt act in order to establish dangerousness� the washington legislature amended its sexual predator commitment statute to reflect the courts decision� state v ward  pd   wash ct app   see kansas v crane  us    emphasizing the constitutional importance of the distinction between those who are dangerous sexual offenders and those more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal law� that distinction is necessary lest civil commitment become a mechanism for retribution or general deterrence��functions properly those of criminal law not civil commitment bush aqua iii  product detail
