an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  at september   cash includes cash on hand and cash in the bank fair value of financial instruments   the carrying value of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents receivables prepaid expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair value due to the relatively shortterm nature of these instruments foreign currencies functional and presentation currency   items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the company and its subsidiary are measured using the

engaged in the business of the acquisition exploration development mining and production of mineral properties and or resources with a current emphasis on iron ore bauxite and tin  mineral claims and other property acquisition costs are capitalized as incurred  such costs are carried as an asset of the company until it becomes apparent through exploration activities that the cost of such properties will not be realized through mining operations  mineral exploration costs are expensed as incurred and when it becomes apparent that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven or probable reserve the exploration costs along with mine development costs are capitalized  the costs of acquiring mineral claims capitalized exploration costs and mine development costs are recognized for depletion and amortization purposes under the unitsofproduction method over the estimated life of the probable and proven reserves  if mineral properties exploration or mine development activities are subsequently abandoned or impaired any capitalized costs are charged to operations in the current period exploration expenditures exploration acquisition except for property purchase costs and general and administrative costs related to exploration projects and prospecting activities are charged to expense as incurred during periods ended september   and  the company incurred exploration expenses of  and  respectively  as at june   the company had completed its prospecting activities in relation to certain iron ore resources at which time all associated overhead pending the extraction of the resource in place has been allocated to general operating expense save certain annual expenses for permitting and licensing of the property   inventory inventories are stated at the lower of costs incurred or market inventories include metals product inventory which is determined by the stage at which the minerals are in processing stockpiled minerals work in process and finished goods stockpiled minerals inventory represents iron ore that has been excavated from inside the mine and then placed on pad area before being crushed and bagged   stockpiles reserves are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile the number of contained metal ounces or pounds based on assay data and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates based on the expected processing method stockpile mineral tonnages are verified by periodic surveys costs are allocated to a stockpile based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the minerals including applicable overhead depreciation depletion and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile’s average cost per recoverable unit work in process inventory represents iron ore that is currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product and may include inventories in our milling process  inprocess material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of the respective plants inprocess inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines and stockpiles plus the inprocess conversion costs including applicable depreciation relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process the company categorizes all of its inventory as work in process  the company processes its inventory which ships to a refiner for end processing and so it never carries finished goods inventory of bauxite includes material acquired from local mining operations as well as transport costs for unshipped material and in transit materials on the basis of weight in tonnes at the present time we do not hold any work in process inventory for iron ore or bauxite  until we begin receiving regular revenues from our milling operations all milling and smelting costs are expensed as incurred impairment of longlived assets   longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets whenever any such impairment exists an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value during the fiscal year ended december   and in the nine months ended september   there was no impairment of long lived assets income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic   incometaxes   this statement prescribes the use of the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse loss per share the company follows the provisions of asc topic   earnings per share   basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period  basic and diluted losses per share are the same as all potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock or conversion of notes into shares of the company’s common stock that could increase the number of shares outstanding and lower the earnings per share of the company’s common stock  this calculation is not done for periods in a loss position as this would be antidilutive  as of december   there were no stock options or stock awards that would have been included in the computation of diluted earnings per share that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future recently issued accounting

fill a gap since indonesia banned ore exports in january  in a bid to encourage valueadded processing at home china will need around  million tonnes of bauxite next year to feed its fastgrowing

the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   under the name pacific metals corp on march   the company changed its name to gmci corp by conducting a statutory merger with its whollyowned subsidiary gmci corp to nevada revised statutes a et seq as a result of such merger the company was the surviving entity on december   a change in control of the company occurred by virtue of the company’s largest shareholder pacific gold corp selling  shares of the company’s common stock to legacy fiduciary services limited such shares represented  of the company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock at the time of the transaction as part of the sale of the shares legacy fiduciary services limited arranged to appoint mr lok khing ming as the sole officer and director of the company at the time on january   the company filed a certificate of amendment with the state of nevada to a increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from  million shares to  billion shares and b decrease all of the company’s then issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one  share for every  existing shares with all fractional shares to be purchased by the company at the price of  per share the “reverse split” these actions were taken by the company’s board of directors after receiving the written consent of shareholders holding  of the company’s voting shares on march   the company entered into a share exchange agreement the “sbs agreement” with all of the shareholders of sbs mining corp malaysia sd bhd “sbs” a malaysian corporation whose primary business is mining and exploration of properties located in malaysia to the share exchange agreement the company acquired  shares of capital stock of sbs from the sbs shareholders and in exchange issued  restricted shares of its common stock to the sbs shareholders the  shares of sbs constituted all of the issued and outstanding shares of sbs and were held by a total of three  shareholders including the company’s sole director and chief executive officer mr lok khing ming mr lok khing ming owned ten percent  of sbs or  shares the remaining shares were owned by mr liew chin loong  shares  who resides in malaysia and lyf son realty sdn bhd a malaysian corporation  shares  to the share exchange agreement mr lok received  million shares of the company’s common stock mr liew received  million shares and lyf son realty sd bhd received  million shares as a result of the share exchange agreement sbs became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and the company now carries on the business of sbs as its primary business the closing of the sbs agreement occurred on april   sbs mining corp malaysia sdn bhd is a producer of metal ore and is focused on producing iron ore bauxite and tin ore currently sbs is principally engaged in the prospecting of minerals and to carry out the mining of minerals upon successful exploration the company is not in actual development or production of any mineral deposits current investments at the time of the acquisition of sbs by gmci sbs held licenses to the following two  properties on which it is prospecting for iron ore mining no mining land mining area hectares sungai bekil mukim of batu talam state of pahang darul makmur malaysia sungai semeriang mukim of batu talam state of pahang darul makmur malaysia the total mining area measures approximately  hectares  acres in january  the licenses for these concessions expired sbs is in negotiations with the owners of these concessions at the time that the sbs agreement was concluded approximately the second quarter of  the market price for iron ore was between  and  sbs believed that there would be a downward trend for iron ore prices and eventually the market price fell below  in december  therefore sbs mining commenced a plan to move into financing bauxite mining and trading in the surrounding area sbs believes that shipments and demand for bauxite will increase as illustrated by the fact that china imported  times more bauxite from malaysia in november  than in march  after an export ban in indonesia stopped supplies of the ore to the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals bauxite mines are springing up in malaysia and shipping an everincreasing amount of the raw material used for the production of aluminum to china helping fill a gap since indonesia banned ore exports in january  in a bid to encourage valueadded processing at home china will need around  million tonnes of bauxite next year to feed its fastgrowing aluminum industry and must import about  million of that according to consultancy cru “definitely bauxite imports from malaysia will increase significantly next year” said wan ling an analyst with cru in beijing forecasting the country’s shipments to china could reach  million tonnes competition currently we do not have any direct competition with respect to the specific properties we hold licenses to if we develop production capacity with respect to bauxite we would compete with other suppliers of these materials because bauxite is sourced worldwide our competition would include companies operating in diverse locations such as australia the peoples republic of china brazil and india among others the companies that commonly are producing materials of this nature are large capitalization companies with established mining clams and operations their deposits are often refined and sold through related parties or to and through companies with which they have long standing relationships in terms of developing our business plan and conducting exploration and later deposit development we also expect to compete for qualified geological and environmental experts to assist us in our exploration of mining prospects as well as any other consultants employees and equipment that we may require in order to conduct our operations currently there is significant competition for financial capital to be deployed in mining and material extraction therefore it is difficult for smaller companies such as us to attract investment for its exploration activities we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to compete for capital funds and without adequate financial resources management cannot assure that the company will be able to compete in exploration activities and ultimately in material deposit development production and sales regulation the exploration and development of a mining prospect in malaysia is subject to regulation by a number of governmental authorities the regulations address many environmental issues relating to air soil and water contamination and apply to many mining related activities including exploration mine construction mineral and ore extraction ore milling water use waste disposal and use of toxic substances in addition we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards occupational health and safety mine safety general land use export of minerals and taxation many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of certain notices the absence of which or inability to obtain will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration development and operation activities the failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect employees effective december   mr lok khing ming was added as the chief executive officer president treasurer and sole director

company” under the jobs act of  and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed  billion if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period or if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of any june  our status as an emerging growth company under the jobs act of  may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an emerging growth company and because we will have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry if we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected we have elected not to have to comply with new and revised accounting standard while we are an emerging growth company until such standards apply to private companies which means our financial statements may not be comparable to other public companies the jobs act affords us the ability to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies this election which we have made is irrevocable the result of this election means that our financial statements may not be comparable to other public companies that comply with the accounting standards when effective there is substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as a going concern our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion that accompanies our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended december   indicating that our accumulated deficit of and negative working capital of  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty at june   we had an accumulated deficit of  and negative working capital of  if we are not able to face and solve one or more of the challenges that a developing company in the mining industry typically encounters we will not succeed in implementing our business plan we expect to face many challenges in our business these will include but are not limited to engaging and retaining the services of qualified geological engineering and mining personnel and consultants establishing and maintaining budgets implementing appropriate financial controls acquiring relevant mineral and ore deposit data efficiently staking and evaluating appropriate prospects establishing initial exploration plans for mining prospects obtaining and verifying studies to determine mineral and ore deposit levels on our prospects ensuring the necessary exploratory and operational permits are filed on a timely basis and the necessary permits are maintained and approved by the federal and state authorities and adhering to regulatory requirements the failure to address one or more of these above factors may impair our ability to carry out our business plan in that event an investment in the company would be substantially impaired we will be dependent on locating and hiring at economical rates independent consultants and occasional workers for the implementation of our business plan to locate obtain and evaluate prospects and to conduct initial testing and later on any excavation and processing we will rely on consultants and occasional workers in addition to our own staff we may not be able to locate employ or retain persons with the appropriate experience and skills to successfully execute our business plan the inability to do the proposed actions on a timely basis or at all may result in the delay of implementing our business plan thereby causing additional expense or our business failure mineral and ore extraction has many risks associated with it which risks may make our business more costly or more difficult to pursue we may have to curtail our operations if we are not able to surmount any issues that we encounter mineral and ore exploration has significant risks some of the exploratory risks include the following it is dependent on locating commercially viable mineral or ore deposits in our prospects and skillful management of prospects once found or located and mineral and ore deposits may vary substantially in a prospect rendering what was initially believed a profitable deposit of little or no value mineral and ore exploration and ultimate exploitation may be affected by unforeseen changes including changes in the value of minerals and ore changes in regulations including mining and environmental regulations environmental concerns about mining in an area or in general particularly in relation to minerals and ores in the rare earth category technical issues relating to extraction such as rock falls subsidence flooding and weather conditions and labor issues any of these individually or together could delay or halt implementation of the business plan or raise costs to levels that may make it unprofitable or impractical to pursue our business objectives our business future is dependent on finding prospects with sufficient mineral and ore grade and consistency without which it may not be practical to pursue the business plan and investors will lose their investment our business model depends on locating prospects with commercially sufficient amounts of iron ore bauxite and tin ore until actual extraction and processing is undertaken we will not know if our prospects have commercially viable mineral or ore deposits that can be profitably marketed even if initial reports about a particular prospect are positive subsequent activities may determine that the prospect is not commercially viable thus at any stage in the exploration and development process we may determine there is no business reason to continue and at that time our financial resources may not enable us to continue exploratory operations and will cause us to terminate our current business plan if we do substantially curtail or terminate our business investors will lose their entire investment the properties that the company holds licenses to may not have any of the mineral or ore deposits sought by the company or if there are such mineral or ore deposits they may not be commercially viable therefore causing a total loss of investment in the company the probability of the properties that the company holds licenses to having mineral or ore deposits of iron ore bauxite or tin ore that are commercially viable is remote the fact that mining is a capital intensive and operationally an expensive business and natural resources are subject to market volatility makes commercial viability difficult to assess and obtain therefore the exploration activities may result in a final decision that there is no commercial point in pursing the mining properties in that event investors will lose their investment in the company with no prospect of realizing on their investment regulatory compliance is complex and the failure to meet all the various requirements could result in loss of a prospect fines or other limitations on the proposed business we will be subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in malaysia the failure or delay in making required filings and obtaining regulatory approvals or licenses will adversely affect our ability to explore for viable mineral or ore deposits and carry out subsequent aspects of our business plan the failure to obtain and comply with any regulations or licenses may result in fines or other penalties and even the loss of our rights over a prospect we expect compliance with these regulations to be a substantial expense in terms of time and cost therefore compliance with or the failure to comply with applicable regulation will affect our ability to succeed in our business plan and ultimately to generate revenues and profits our business plan is premised on the price of minerals and ores in the global markets our business plan depends on the price of minerals and ores in the global markets the viability of any commercialization of minerals and ores will depend on the cost of recovery versus the market price of the mineral or ore and whether or not it has uses in the markets an increase in market use and price will encourage industry interest in mine development of smaller operations such as our prospects and improve the likelihood of our overall success the viability of our business plan is also dependent on the price of minerals and ores remaining at least at current prices if prices fall substantially from the current levels then our costs will be such that there will be insufficient profit margins and incentives to pursue our business plan in that event the company will have to curtail its business plan and investors will lose their investment the company faces competition from established mining operations and competition may develop among the junior mining companies which will be better able to locate stake and explore new mineral and ore sources more cost effectively and quicker than us there are many established mining companies that command greater resources than those available to the company these established companies have adequate financing established claims operations that are working and established means of extracting processing and distribution additionally there are numerous junior mining exploration and production companies in existence that may be compete with us if the prices iron ore bauxite or tin ore increase these smaller companies may be more established and have resources unavailable to the company which will provide them advantage in their exploration development and extraction activities these companies likely would be able to reach production stages sooner than the company and obtain market share before us if our competition is such that we cannot compete and generate a sufficient return on our investment and operations we may be forced to curtail our operations resulting in a loss to investors we will compete with other mining enterprises for appropriate consultants and employees we will compete in the hiring of appropriate geological engineering permitting environmental and other operational experts to assist with the location exploration and development of prospects and implementation of our business plan we believe we will have to offer or pay appropriate cash compensation and options to induce persons to be associated with an earlystage exploration company if we are unable to make appropriate compensation packages available to induce persons to be associated with the company because of its limited resources we will not be able to hire the persons we need to carry out our business plan in that event investors will have their investment impaired or it may be entirely lost the company will require additional capital to fund expanded operations without which we will have to curtail our plans and investors may lose the potential of their investment to commence our business plan we will need additional capital we believe we will need substantial amounts of equity investment in the early stages of our business plan if we encounter unexpected expenses the initial amounts of working capital will have to be increased therefore we may need additional capital sooner than expected during the exploratory stages of the business plan the mining business in all of its aspects requires significant capital without additional capital the company will have to curtail or substantially modify its overall business plan or abandon elements of it as of june   the company had approximately  in related party debt which if it cannot repay when due will permit the holders to seek renegotiation or bankruptcy alternatives the result of which could terminate implementation of the business plan the company has  of debt related to advances from our majority shareholder officers and directors to meet obligations in the normal course and for general working capital from time to time the company may also have trade debt and equipment financing outstanding if the company is unable to repay any of its obligations when due the creditors could put the company into bankruptcy or force renegotiation of the terms of outstanding debt on terms that may be substantially less favorable in either event the ability of the company to pursue its business plan will be impaired and the equity of the company will become worthless to settle existing debt and any other debt outstanding from time to time the company may seek agreement with the holders to exchange the debt or obligation for shares of capital stock in that case there may be dilution experienced by investors in the company the management cannot predict whether it will be able to use any capital stock in this manner or the amount of capital stock that may have to be issued the company does not have any identified sources of additional capital the absence of which may prevent it from continuing its operations the company does not have any arrangements with any investment banking firms or institutional lenders because we will need additional capital in the future we will have to expend significant effort to raise operating funds these efforts may not be successful and they may be disruptive to our executives other responsibilities and our operations in the absence of necessary capital we will have to limit or curtail operations a majority stockholder has the ability to control our business direction because our majority stockholder owns approximately  of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock it is in a position to control the election of our board of directors and the selection of officers management and consultants therefore investors will be entirely dependent on its judgment in implementing the business plan of the company there is not an active trading market for our common stock and if a market for our common stock does not develop our investors may be unable to sell their shares our common stock is currently quoted on the otc pink trading system the otc pink trading system is not a listing service or exchange but is instead a dealer quotation service for subscribing members the securities that trade on the otc pink trading system tend to be highly illiquid and there is a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the otc pink in addition the value of our common stock could be affected by many factors such as the following some of which we may not be able to control or influence actual or anticipated variations in our operating results changes in the market valuations of other companies operating in our industry announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments additions or departures of key personnel sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market and conditions or trends in the market in which we operate in a volatile market investors may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our securities these fluctuations may prevent investors from obtaining a market price equal to the purchase price upon an attempt to sell our securities in the open market in these situations investors may be required either to sell our securities at a market price which is lower than the purchase price or to hold our securities for a longer period of time than planned an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies assets or technologies by using common stock as consideration a decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital it may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business a prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities or convertible debt instruments a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock if we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations as a result our business may suffer and not be successful and we may go out of business we also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business because our principal assets will be located in malaysia outside of the united states and some of our officers and directors reside outside of the united states it may be difficult for an investor to enforce any right based on us federal securities laws against us andor our officers and directors or to enforce a judgment rendered by a united states court against us or our officers or directors our principal operations and assets will be located in malaysia outside of the united states and some of our officers and directors are nonresidents of the united states therefore it may be difficult to effect service of process on all our officers or directors in the united states and it may be difficult to enforce any judgment rendered against our officers or directors as a result it may be difficult or impossible for an investor to bring an action against all our officers or directors in the event that an investor believes that such investor’s rights have been infringed under the us securities laws or otherwise even if an investor is successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of malaysia or any other country may render that investor unable to enforce a judgment against the assets of our officers or directors as a result our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management officers or directors compared to shareholders of a corporation doing business and whose officers and directors reside within the united states additionally because of our assets are located outside of the united states they will be outside of the jurisdiction of united states courts to administer if we become subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding as a result if we declare bankruptcy or insolvency our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the united states under united states bankruptcy laws we believe that if the prospective investors are located outside of the united states that the protection afforded them by the united states bankruptcy code will be unavailable for them or that it may not be enforceable where the primary assets are located we cannot assure you that we will declare dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments and as a result you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it although we do not currently intend to pay dividends to the extent we decide in the future to pay dividends on our common stock we will pay such dividends at such times and in such amounts as the board of directors determines appropriate and in accordance with applicable law our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends going forward or as to the amount of such dividends as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it our common stock is and will be subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness shares of our common stock are common equity interests in us and as such will rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities additionally our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors because we may be subject to the penny stock rules you may have difficulty in selling our common stock our common stock may be subject to regulations of the sec relating to the market for penny stocks penny stock as defined by the penny stock reform act is any equity security not traded on a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than  per share the penny stock regulations generally require that a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith be delivered to purchasers of penny stocks and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the brokerdealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement prior to the sale in addition the brokerdealer must make certain mandated disclosures including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid offer quotations as well as the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons the regulations applicable to penny stocks may severely affect the market liquidity for your common stock and could limit your ability to sell your securities in the secondary market the financial industry regulatory authority finra sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock which could depress the price of our shares finra has adopted rules that require brokerdealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer prior to recommending speculative lowpriced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status and investment objectives among other things under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability such speculative lowpriced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers thus finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares have an adverse effect on the market for our shares and thereby depress our share price item  financial information this current report on form k contains forwardlooking statements

description and location the claims are located at an elevation of  feet above mean sea level and are accessible by a dirt road that is maintained during the summer months by the united states forest service the property which is referred to as the graysill property encompasses the historic graysill mine a past producer of vanadium and uranium ore the graysill mine is known to have produced vanadium and byproduct uranium during a period of approximately twenty years after world war ii before the mine ceased production approximately  tons of ore were mined with a reported grade of  vanadium pentoxide and  uranium oxide in  representatives of the united states department of the interior bureau of mines division examined a number of abandoned mines in the san juan national forest one of which was the graysill mine subsequently in  the bureau of mines produced a mineral land assessment open file report titled mineral appraisal of san juan national forest colorado most of the information relating to the graysill mine and the geology and mineralization of the general area within which the graysill property is located was obtained from this open file report the property is underlain by a gently dipping assemblage of paleozoic and mesozoic sedimentary rocks within which vanadium and uranium occurs in many of the rock units in a stratabound manner exhibiting little or no apparent relationship to regional structural trends although vanadium and uranium occurrences are ubiquitous and are known to exist in over  distinctly different sedimentary units in the vicinity of the property of american uranium the pennsylvanianpermian rico formation and the upper jurassic entrada sandstone are the only formations which have been mined previously for vanadium and uranium most of the past production has come from the entrada sandstone historically there have been a number of uraniferous vanadium deposits developed in the entrada sandstone along a sinuous trend extending in a northsouth direction for over  miles this trend coincides with a major structural feature representing a transitional zone between the colorado plateau and the southern rocky mountain physiographic
