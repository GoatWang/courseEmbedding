at  am comments   share tweet share   reddit email geekwire summit earlybird tickets here valueact’s g mason morfit microsoft’s newest board member g mason morfit is the president of valueact capital and at  years old he is by far the youngest member of the board which is otherwise populated by industry veterans in their s and s his appointment to the board is the result of the “cooperation agreement” struck between microsoft and valueact capital last august which included an option for valueact to place morfit on the board at the time valueact had accumulated microsoft shares totaling about  percent of the company valueact wants microsoft to reduce its focus on windows speeding up its efforts to put office and other microsoft applications on competing operating systems including ios and android according to a report by bloomberg news last month but much of morfit’s work won’t be visible to people outside the company or even outside the board during an an april  lecture series sponsored by stanford law school morfit explained the company’s approach to “activist” investing here’s a key excerpt from his remarks everybody wants to talk about the latest scandal of the day or the sexy conflict in the wall street journal that is a small small minority of shareholder activism as our firm evolved through the last decade we’ve tried and failed and tried and succeeded at a lot of things we’ve done proxy fights we’ve done public campaigns we’ve done very mediadriven efforts but we’ve found that the most effective thing we can do is working behind the scenes and building on our network and in a collegial spirit influence companies so the lion’s share of our success is due to stuff that you have no idea ever happened he added later “for us it’s just a truism that people will do want you want if they like you and you haven’t publicly humiliated them … you’re much better off in our experience influencing people through the power of factbased analysis relationships introductions earning trust” morfit a princeton grad who previously worked in equity research has been with valueact since january  serving on a variety of boards at public companies but none as big as microsoft along with new microsoft chairman john thompson and ceo satya nadella he is part of an overall changing of the guard at microsoft that creates the potential at least for a much different type of company in the years ahead  here’s the full video of morfit and former blackrock executive abe friedman talking about activist investment strategies part of a threepart lecture series at
