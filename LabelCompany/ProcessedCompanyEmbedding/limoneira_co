blogcustom publishingabout usthe magazinetestimonialsmedia kitcontact ussubscribe for free producers  february  limoneira co email facebook twitter google linkedin stumble there are plenty of ways limoneira co differentiates itself from other agribusinesses in the united states the company stands alone through its sustainable business operations its quality control methods and the rigorous traceability processes in place for its citrus produce however the ability to understand what it takes to stand out from the rest in the crowded citrusgrowing industry comes over time and there aren’t many producers that can boast continuous operations for more than a century like limoneira can “we have a little bit of a leg up because we’ve been around since  so we’ve been doing this for  years” president and ceo harold s edwards says “we’ve been pretty successful at being a sustainable business and our business practice is to have good sustainable suppliers” the company traces its origins to  when union oil founder wallace l hardison partnered with nathan w blanchard to purchase  acres of land from jk gries in santa paula calif about one hour north of los angeles the partners envisioned becoming the first largescale citrus supplier for us markets so limoneira – which means “lemon lands” in portuguese – developed a more reliable supply chain for citrus to ship to the east coast in its early days the company also supplied valencia oranges and walnuts today limoneira is the largest vertically integrated lemon supplier in the united states all of which are marketed under the limoneira brand the company also stands as the largest avocado grower in the united states and limoneira boasts large orange and specialty citrus orchards in its portfolio edwards says the company supplies product all over the world with  percent of its distribution heading to foreign markets especially southeast asia limoneira owns and operates  acres throughout california and has added pistachios and cherries to its offerings about  percent of the company’s lemon business comes from foodservices clients with retail accounting for the rest of the sales here comes the sun limoneira takes pride in its status as a sustainably operated agribusiness and edwards says it strives to reduce its carbon footprint by making strategic investments in solar water soil and integrated pest management ipm “the company has had a commitment to good stewardship to resources since its inception” edwards says “what we’ve found over time is our approach to production and the way we market and sell and work with employees have all been neatly captured under the popular trend called sustainability we’re finding more and more of our customer base putting more importance on how their suppliers and vendors view sustainability and we rank highly on their indexes” for instance limoneira relies heavily on solar power for the energy it needs to run its business in  limoneira completed two stateoftheart solar projects at its headquarters in santa paula the company installed a acre photovoltaic orchard that generates  megawatt of electricity limoneira states that and this represents  percent of the company’s packing operations in ducor calif – about  miles north of headquarters – limoneira installed four smaller solar installations that combine to generate another full megawatt of electricity this powers horsepower motors that pump deep well water into reservoirs for the irrigation of  agricultural acres through these solar energy projects limoneira estimates that the solar generation of  million kilowatt hours will save at least  tons of greenhouse gases that would have otherwise been emitted by an oil or coalfiring power plant over  years edwards states that  percent of all electricity limoneira uses is generated through its investments in solar power as for its organic waste limoneira partnered with agromin – a manufacturer of premium soil products and a green waste recycler in southern california – for a comprehensive organic recycling program the companies developed a acre facility on limoneira land to receive green materials such as lawn clippings leaves and bark from ventura county calif the material is converted into mulch that is spread in limoneira’s orchards to curb erosion improve water efficiency reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures this partnership recycles  percent of western ventura county’s green waste to create mulch and compost for its use to avoid putting more pesticides into the environment limoneira long ago launched associates insectary this growerowned cooperative formed in  provides complete pest control services to commercial citrus and avocado farmers by breeding beneficial insects to control destructive agricultural pests also for the water it needs to support its business limoneira maintains water quality and supply through rigorous lab testing filtration systems and a network of micro sprinklers “all of this is being done with the highest level of detail and attention paid to food safety and traceability for the food products we supply” edwards says “we’re the largest and only global gap good agricultural practices treetodock lemon supplier in the us and that allows us to optimize procedures and provide instant traceability and of all the way to the blocks or trees where our produce comes from this assures the highest level of quality in our food safety practices” traceable  accountable aside from the sustainable aspects of their operations limoneira and similar growers must adhere to the strictest traceability standards as set by foodservice and retail buyers throughout the united states and around the world “consumers and as a result the trade – foodservice and retail buyers specifically – have become increasingly more focused on traceability and food safety initiatives and concerns so we have a desire to create traceability to the production sources” edwards says “a lot of it is just recordkeeping and allowing records to be complete” because limoneira is a vertically integrated lemon business – meaning its products are plucked from the trees sent to a warehouse and delivered to customers under the company’s watch – it boasts full traceability of its products “that gives our customer base a much greater degree of confidence that our highest quality and safety is an instantly traceable product to them” edwards says “in combination with that and being considered one of the leaders among sustainable producers it puts us at the top of the list of suppliers for the customers we work with some of this country’s largest customers choose us over larger suppliers for the things we do in that regard” the growing middle class as limoneira expands further into asia its ability to cater to the tastes of the everexpanding middle class in this part of the world will help it grow edwards says the company has witnessed growing global consumption of lemons especially in china and india where burgeoning economies are getting stronger every year edwards says the company has seen its lemon business double in size and limoneira is expected to ship between  million and  million cartons of lemons worldwide in  compared to just  million in  he attributes this rapid growth to a nationwide advertising and promotional campaign called “unleash the natural power of lemons” which introduces consumers to alternative uses for the versatile lemon “as we’ve begun to launch initiatives in cities in the united states we begin to move up in the overall category of lemon consumption” edwards says check out our latest edition subscribe for free   latest new  notable products archive contact janice click here to advertise with us tweets by foodanddrinkmag video see more

working within lemon niche internationally by tad thompson  july   limoneira co inc in santa paula ca is formalizing yearold relationships with lemon export allies in both argentina and chile on june  alex teague senior vice president of the firm which is a division of calavo told the produce news “we have had over the last  years an informal association with the two groups” limoneira is “beginning a formalization” with fgf trapani headquartered in tucuman argentina and rosales packing in la serena chile the new arrangement means limoneira’s product will now be shipped from chile and argentina mr teague also noted that limoneira is a selling agent for lemons grown in mexico for the first time handling fruit from the monterey area that product will be available from july until december according to the limoneira web site the company was created in  and produces lemons from  acres throughout california mr teague said that the california growing operations supply limoneira lemons year round but the volume is unable to satisfy demand at certain times of the year thus he said the three additional countries complement limoneira’s domestic and export sales the process of finding international alliances has involved taking the time to pick firms with similar interests in handling highquality product sustainable practices and producing foodsafe lemons he noted lemons “from argentina chile and mexico are high quality for that time of year they fit our marketing window for the quality niche we have they are a strong piece of the puzzle” limoneira enjoys “heavy exports to the pacific rim and during the summertime chilean fruit takes a quality position in the marketplace in japan” limoneira will be servicing japanese customers throughout the year “with traditional california labels with fruit from both california and chile” chile will supply “a fresher crop and has a strong summer position in japan” the chilean lemons are generally shipped by sea containers to panama and then transshipped to japan “this is part of being a marketdriven lemon supplier — to have the best fruit of the best quality with the best price that week” mr teague said that chilean lemons have been exported to japan for “quite a while” and he added that limoneira might be the first california shipper associated with the deal argentine lemons have not been allowed into the united states since a phytosanitary dispute created a ban in  thus limoneira is involved in shipping argentine lemons directly to eastern canada from buenos aires “we have been doing this quite a while we are not reinventing the wheel although we do work to improve it in essence this is a marketdriven service our customers rely on us to be their lemon supplier” popular stories new report says eat fresh
