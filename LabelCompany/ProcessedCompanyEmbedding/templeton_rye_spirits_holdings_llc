to produce a lightbodied dry rum amber or golden rums from puerto rico are aged for a minimum of three years and have caramel added to enhance the color gained from the casks amber rums are slightly mellower and more aromatic than white rums a third type of lightbodied rum is añejo aged in wood from four to six years producing the mellowest and most flavorful of the puerto rican rumsin contrast fullbodied rums are made using a skimming process in which part of the previous distillation is added to the molasses in the fermentation vats this process results in a very flavorful aromatic spirit that in the case of jamaican rum is almost always blended and requires at least five to seven years of barrel aging sign up for our newsletter company about us privacy  security legal statement
