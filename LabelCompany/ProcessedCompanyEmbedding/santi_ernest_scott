instructions this call is being recorded if you have any objections you may disconnect at this point now i will turn the meeting over to your host aaron hoffman sir you may begin aaron hoffman thanks evan good morning and welcome to itw’s first quarter  conference call joining me this morning are our ceo scott santi and our cfo michael larsen during today’s call we will discuss our first quarter  financial results and update you on our  earnings forecast before we get to the results let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the  second quarter and fullyear as well as other forwardlooking statements identified on this slide we refer you to the company’s  form k for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations also this presentation uses certain nongaap measures while we use very few nongaap measures a reconciliation of those nongaap measures to the most comparable gaap measure is contained in the press release and with that i’ll turn the call over to scott ernest scott santi thanks aaron and good morning overall a pretty solid start to the year for itw as we delivered solid nearterm results and continue to make good progress in executing our strategy to position the company to deliver solid growth with bestinclass margins and returns in the quarter we continued to deliver meaningful improvement on all of our key performance metrics we grew eps   excluding the impact of foreign currency translation organic growth came in at the midpoint of our forecast and was up   excluding the impact of our pls initiatives we improved operating margin by  basis points to  and increased after tax return on invested capital by  basis points to  both our operating margin and our roic metrics were new alltime first quarter highs for the company free cash flow was also strong in the quarter at  of net income based on current demand trends and our strong operational and margin performance in the quarter we are raising our gaap eps guidance for  by  at the midpoint before turning the call over michael for more detail on our q results i’d like to thank all of our itw colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy michael over to you michael larsen thank you scoot and good morning everybody as you saw this morning itw is off to a strong start in  as the company delivered another solid quarter with excellent quality of earnings gaap eps of  increased  versus prior year and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by  driven by better operating margin as a result of strong operational execution on our enterprise initiatives organic revenue was up  and in line with our guidance as north america grew  and international declined  as scott mentioned we established a number of new alltime highs for our first quarter operating margin of  improved  basis points with strategic sourcing  practice excellence and business structure simplification all contributing in a very meaningful way given the strong margin performance in the quarter we now expect that operating margin will exceed  for the full year operating income of  million was also a first quarter record the prior record of  million was preenterprise strategy in  and was achieved with revenues that were about  billion higher in this quarter after tax roic was solid fee cash flow was strong and we repurchased shares for  million just a comment on our external financial reporting as you know at itw we work hard to keep our external reporting simple consistent and transparent we only report one eps number and that is gaap eps there are no adjusted eps numbers that said let me just point out two items that are included in our first quarter gaap eps number of  first foreign currency translation which was right in line with our guidance assumption an unfavorable  yearoveryear second last year’s first quarter included a nonrecurring gain on the sale of our business as a result in the first quarter of last year other income was  million compared to  million this quarter excluding these two items eps would have increased  we strongly believe that in the current economic environment and over the longterm our highly profitable and diversified portfolio is the core strength of the company we are very well balanced in terms of our endmarket and geographic exposures and well positioned to perform at a high level across a wide range of economic scenarios our consumer facing businesses makeup  of our revenues and include the automotive oem and food equipment segments as well as portions of specialty products and construction these businesses continue to deliver stable high quality growth in the first quarter our consumer facing businesses were up  versus prior year and up  sequentially our industrial facing businesses such as welding and test and measurement and electronics account for  of our revenues and as expected they declined yearoveryear as you can see these businesses were now  but showed some improvement versus q when they were down  as you know the yearoveryear comparisons continue to ease as we go through the year  organic revenue growth in the quarter  excluding our product line simplification initiatives or pls by region north america was up  with our consumerfacing businesses up  solid growth continues in food equipment up  automotive up  and construction products with renovation remodeling up  industrial facing businesses were down  with welding down  and test and measurement and electronics down  on the international side overall down  with europe up  and asiapac down  our international consumer businesses grew  and industrial was down  primarily due to welding at itw we believe that operating margin is a key indicator of our business as competitive advantage and the efficiency with which they leverage it it is in our view a compelling indicator of the strength and competitiveness of itw and is a key performance metric for every itw business in the first quarter operating margin improved  basis points to  and six of our seven segments improved construction products increased  basis points specialty products  basis points food equipment  basis points and automotive was up  basis points to mention a few approximately half of the decline in welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items and the team continues to do a good job in a challenging environment as evidenced by their ability to sustain operating margins in the mids despite a significant decline in revenue you can also see the positive impact of volume leverage in the faster growing segments which gives you a sense for what margins and overall profitability will look like as organic growth picks up on the right side of the page we listed the drivers of our operating margin improvement this quarter starting with  basis points from our selfhelp enterprise initiatives given the strong performance and positive momentum we are now expecting more than  basis points in the enterprise initiatives this year price cost came in as expected stable and favorable at  basis points the unfavorable  basis points in the other line is primarily related to investments in growth and the overhead inflation overall continued strong execution on enterprise initiatives and progress on delivering bestinclass margins consistently and sustainably before we get into the segment results we listed the quarterly progression on operating margin expansion since the first quarter of   basis points at the enterprise level as you can see construction improved  basis points  basis points in food equipment and more than  basis points in automotive and specialty products overall good progress with more to come turning to the segments automotive oem had another strong quarter with organic revenue up  and  operating margin while  organic growth is a little below what we’ve seen out of our automotive oem segment over the last several quarters this segment had a very tough comp and q revenue came in right what we planned it to be in the first quarter of last year the launch of several new programs in europe resulted in revenue growth of  versus builds of  which is what created tough comp for the business this year our longterm growth target for our automotive oem business remains  to  percentage points of above market growth annually and based on already sold programs and our new programs pipeline we expect to meet or exceed that target both in  and for at least the next several years beyond in north america  organic growth compares to auto builds of up  and the detroit  up  china was up  in the quarter despite the fact the builds at western oems were down slightly as expected operating margin improved  basis points to  the highest in the company the quick update on the acquisition of efc from zf trw that we announced last quarter the acquisition remains on track and we expect the deal to close midyear as a reminder efc should be modestly accretive to eps in the first  months with accelerating benefit from  and beyond another strong quarter in food equipment up  organically with strength in north america up  despite a challenging comparison north america equipment was up  with strength in refrigeration and cooking and the service was up  international was up  with equipment up  and service flat continued strong margin performance as operating margin improved by  basis points to  test  measurement and electronics organic revenue down  test  measurement down  and electronics slightly better at down  sequentially the segment was stable down  compared to typical seasonality of down  still a challenging external environment for our welding business and organic growth declined  the  yearoveryear decline breaks down as  points from oil and gas  points from industrial and  point from commercial north america was down  with equipment down  and consumables down  international was down  primarily due to oil and gas we saw some slowing sequentially with demand trends down  compared to the typical  increase and the team continues to take appropriate action on the cost side as i mentioned earlier approximately half of the operating margin declined in welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other nonoperating items polymers  fluids achieved positive organic revenue growth of  north america and international were both up  and automotive aftermarket improved  strong quarter in construction products as organic revenue increased  with north america up  renovation remodeling was up  commercial was up  and residential was up  asia pacific was up  and europe flat very strong progress on operating margin up  basis points to  solid quarter in specialty products with organic revenue up  with strength in our consumer packaging businesses north america was up  and international was flat and very strong progress on operating margin with an increase of  basis points to  so for the year based on our margin performance in the first quarter we are raising of fullyear eps guidance by  to a new range of  to  the  midpoint is  earnings growth our organic revenue growth expectation of  to  is unchanged and in line with current run rates we’re forecasting that enterprise initiatives will deliver more than  basis points of margin improvement and that full year operating margin will exceed  we still expect free cash flow conversion to exceed  and we are targeting  billion in share repurchases for the second quarter our gaap eps guidance is  to  up  at the  midpoint that puts  of our full year eps forecast into first half of the year which is consistent with prior years and with that let me turn the call back to aaron aaron hoffman great thanks michael we will now open the call to your question please be brief so to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question and please remember one question and one followup question questionandanswer session operator thank you speakers we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john inch from deutsche bank your line is now open john inch thank you where am i from alright first i want to thank you by the way for the gaap presentation of earnings and frankly for doing a call and not a selective disclosure podcast so much appreciated can we and don’t answer that can we just talk about currency michael i know you said it was in line with expectations it was a little bit more of a drag just based on where we were marking currencies that we thought would happen in the quarter so was there i realized got a lot of exposure to australian dollar and i don’t know just with the pound and so forth maybe could you talk about just give us a little more color in terms of the currency fluctuation and where you’ve marked this for the rest of the year and how you expect that to progress in terms of driver your contribution michael larsen right john so you are headed down the right path here so you have to look beyond just the euro and if you look at the changes in pound canadian and australian dollar that’s when you get to the  translation impact here in the first quarter on the topline and  of eps headwind which was right in lined with the assumption we had in our guidance for the rest of the year that translation impact will at current rates as we sit here today will be lower and maybe if you headed down the path of eps impact for the balance of the year it is correct but based on current rates as we sit here today not just looking at the euro but at the other currency that we mentioned if currency stays exactly where it is things could turn out a little bit better but as you know there is a lot of volatility in currency so we have not included that in the numbers we gave you today john inch okay but you did beat the midpoint of your guide by almost  and michael larsen yes and that is entirely driven by operating margins john inch right no i see michael larsen so the john inch no its right i see that but at current rates how much of a tailwind we have in currency today versus what we had when you first marked rates giving the first quarter in your head guidance isn’t it like  or something michael larsen i just say this it’s a little bit better than what we had assumed and that’s as we sit here today let’s see where rates go from here like i said it could be a little bit better based on rates as they are today john inch okay so my followup i want to ask you and scott what do you think of the or what do you make of the ism it saw that everyone seems to look at and if you look at the new orders component i mean it sort of telling you that a big recovery is on the comp now last year was flashing green and manufacturing was going the other way so i think i’m just trying to get your sense you are a real time company short cycle you are in the economy do you think that the ism is reflecting perhaps some seasonal improvement some sentiment improvement only perhaps a little bit of systematic inventory restock or are you just seeing a complete disconnect i just want again focus on north america please and how do you based in your years of experience how do you interpret the ism and why frankly wouldn’t you be even more positive on your outlook ernest scott santi we’ve never from our particular lens we’ve never viewed the ism number as having a terrific correlation to conditions we’re seeing on the ground certainly not way off but i think from the standpoint of either leading or lagging it’s not been particularly reflective of the conditions that we’re seeing what i will tell is my take on the quarter is that we saw a pretty solid demands throughout so i think things are relatively firm for right now the one exception to that is obviously welding we’re hopefully we’re getting to close a bottom but i can’t say that we’re seeing anything that tells us that but beyond that the overall demand profile inside the company was pretty solid as we move through the quarter so no big movement and certainly not any weakening as we move through the quarter john inch well scott every month has its own seasonal characteristics and we had this weather compares especially in the midwest its indiscernible because i realize it’s complicated but if you try and adjust for all that do you think that underlying demand is picking up for your businesses or is it still not clear like if you look at things of how the quarter progressed and then into april ernest scott santi yeah i’d say it’s been pretty firm i think it’s a little early in a quarter to call with one quarters worth of data but i think again in the aggregate things were pretty solid through the quarter look at our consumer facing businesses where the overall demand rates have been pretty solid going back you know four or five quarters now i think we’re feeling good about where we sit in the kind of the overall demand picture that we saw in the first quarter that being said it’s still a pretty choppy environment out there but there was no new worry beats based on our first quarter performance that we saw across the company john inch okay so basically signs are very stable but no sort of obvious inflections of sequential improvement on the comp right again adjusting for seasonality ernest scott santi no john inch okay good enough thank you guys appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of joseph ritchie from goldman sachs your line is now open joseph ritchie thanks good morning guys ernest scott santi good morning joseph ritchie so i guess my first question is on auto again first solid quarter but clearly you guys had a really really tough comp especially if you look on a two year stack is the expectations that growth starts to improve beyond the first quarter on your auto business just based on what you know on production schedules and where in the platforms that you are on michael larsen yeah so i think you know we talked about a tough comp in the first quarter due to the new programs launched in europe and if you recall europe last year was up  on builds of  so that comp will be with us for the year but in terms of the yearoveryear organic growth rate as we sit here today looking at the typical seasonality q is the lowpoint for the year and the organic growth rate on a yearoveryear basis will improve as we go through the year joseph ritchie okay great thanks michael and maybe my following question moving onto welding so clearly the part of your portfolio there has been a little bit more challenge you guys mentioned half of the margin performance this quarter was related to restructuring action does that start to tailoff as we progress through the year or how were you thinking about that business i guess clearly on the face of it when you take a look at the detrimental detrimental margins in the first quarter are pretty high just trying to get a sense for how that business will project for the rest of the year michael larsen yeah so we had as you said about half of the impact in the first quarter here the margin decline down  which is a pretty significant organic about half of that was restructuring related we expect a similar impact here in q and then improvement in the second half of the year on the margin side and obviously the comparisons get significantly easier in the back half of the year so last year in the first quarter welding was down  which sounds like an easy comp but actually it’s not when you look how the rest of  unfolded so the comps will get better as we go through this year based on current sequential trends that we look at we’ll see flat to positive in the back half and the margins will improve also in the back half we have another slug of restructuring to get through in the second quarter and then for now hopefully the worst is behind us joseph ritchie okay great thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nigel coe from morgan stanley your line is now open nigel coe thanks good morning just wanted to followup on john’s question hello can you hear me ernest scott santi yeah we can hear you nigel coe so there is some chatter that the march was a bit weaker than jan and february for industrial markets did you see that doesn’t sound like you did given your comments ernest scott santi we did not nigel coe okay good moving on to construction and construction was the stand out this quarter with  and  north america and i’m wondering is there any way to trying to understand how of this is weather driven i’m assuming the construction activity did benefit from weather and how much has been pulled forward from maybe q into q and maybe just characterize that by talking about how you exit the quarter on construction products was it pretty steady as well ernest scott santi yeah to answer to your question is there is really no way to factor weather in in terms of how it might have impacted our results relative to whatever you might call it normalized year so which is a big reason why we usually don’t bite on any single quarter trends in construction as predictive or indicative of overall demand i think what i would say is we certainly exited the quarter in pretty good shape there and so i think we are not seeing anything slow down or ease up and we’ll hope it continues through the balance of the year for sure nigel coe okay great and just a quick followon on the construction europe is flat and we’ve seen some signs of maybe green shoots in construction activity in europe but i know that uk is an important end market so i’m wondering can you maybe just talk about leasing in europe as the uk starting to slow down for europe and i see in some green shoots in continental europe ernest scott santi no we are not seeing anything slowdown we are a bit of lager in terms of when our products are actually going on to the job it’s well after the start phase so i think in terms of color the overall sort of macro view over there from the standpoint construction is things are heading in the right direction nigel coe great thanks a lot guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of andrew kaplowitz from citigroup your line is now open andrew kaplowitz good morning guys nice quarter ernest scott santi thank you michael larsen good morning andrew kaplowitz you’re more than  you are four years into enterprise strategy and q ‘ appears to be your best quarter really in the last four years in terms of margin contribution from the enterprise strategy so what surprising is that we would think that given tougher comparisons and given you are now obviously more than half way done with your initiatives you are hitting this kind of performance can you give us a little more color as to what’s going on is it just that your team is now better at implementing your initiatives are they nearly in the program or is that you are tackling more complicated areas of your business such as european construction or specific products that you actually find it easier to improve efficiency ernest scott santi well what i would probably say is that we are these were not a series of initiatives that we are all implemented simultaneously so we are basically sequencing through if you look at the progression that we laid out and we talked about this as early on that we were heavily focused on the portfolio business structure simplification sourcing we said all long had a ramp if you remember that it was now famously known as the heat map from our first presentation and then we had an initiative that was related to what we call business model excellence which we’re applying the itw business model to be scaled up much more focused businesses and so what we are seeing today is much more now of an impact from sourcing the layer stage stuff so it wasn’t necessarily in all at once sort of level of execution across all those initiatives they were very intentionally laid out in the sequence because we had to get certain things done that will allow us to get to the next phase things so some of the improvement that we are seeing and is just now sourcing and business model excellence starting to take over from bss and the portfolio work that we did and the other thing that i would say is you are starting to see some impact from incremental contribution from organic growth as we starting to make the pivot to growth and michael showed you a chart earlier but if you look at that where we had the best margin performance in the quarter was in this the parts of the company that were generating most organic growth so the elevated level of profitability and the incremental profit we generate and every dollar of organic is now starting to contribute as we move into this next phase of our strategy andrew kaplowitz got it scott so let me ask you about the pivot to growth that you’ve talked before about  of your businesses is being ready to grow by the end of ‘ from  i guess in the last year so how many more businesses or even should we be thinking like this that you convert in q as ready to grow and when you do convert these are you seeing the growth progression of businesses that you expect and you still have percentage point headwind on growth from pls in the quarter i think you’ve thought about  bps for the year how does that progression work out does it start falling does the headwind start falling significantly just at the very end of the year or does it start falling now ernest scott santi well to start with the last part first the portfolio work that we’re doing at the product line level at some point is going to dissipate i think we are  frankly we’re there is still a fair amount of that to do heading into ‘ we won’t know what that looks like for ‘ fully until we get into the planning cycle but i would say we’re certainly moving in the direction of getting to the tailwind of that and it will not be some ongoing maintenance that we do but it will not be something we’ll talk about anymore won’t have a significant impact at some point but it is a process that takes some time to work through we have to move customers from product a to product b it’s not something that we can just  we just start selling something so it does take some work and there is a process attached to it but i would expect that number in ‘ will be lower than it was in ‘ and certainly by the end of the ‘ it should be a nonfactor on the first part of your question we are sort of executing the plan that we laid out we are  i can’t give you a number for how many crossed the transition line from preparing to grow to ready to grow in the first quarter but we’ve got a lot of planning around hitting that  level by year end and at that point those businesses start to change their focus to grow as i would certainly note that it’s not necessarily something where we look for an immediate ramp but ultimately what it means is there is significant part of their organizational energy and effort  plus start to go into focusing on fully leveraging their organic growth potential and from that we certainly expect a change in growth rate velocity inside those businesses and we’ve already shown that in places like food equipment and automotive that have been that furthest ones down the path andrew kaplowitz thanks scott operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david raso from evercore isi your line is now open david raso thank you i know you maintained your organic sales growth guidance in total as well as total company sales but maybe i missed it but did you change your outlook at all within the business segments any particular end markets be it global auto builds construction starts i mean any color you can give us on changes within that keeping the total michael larsen no david we didn’t change anything by segment so when we look at our internal planning like we said automotive and as well as the other segments we’re right on track in q and so we haven’t changed anything in terms of our outlook for the year by segments david raso and then given the auto acquisition is still hopefully you are going to be closed to relatively soon but the ma front obviously was not bigger deal i assume you’re still out looking at other things can you give us an update on how we should think about ma as we move further into the year into next year michael larsen yeah we are still focused on working the plan which is not  ma is not a big priority we have what we think is a terrific opportunity that we brought in in this auto business and we’re focused on getting that one closed there is and we’ve talked about where these  where acquisitions fitting our strategy this is we’re going to  well look at things that we think can further support to reinforce the organic growth strategies of our seven segments and there is probably two or three little bolton floating around at any given time but not a big priority our big priority is continuing to move down the path of executing these initiatives internally getting ourselves very focused then on fully leveraging the organic growth potential for other reasons i talked about earlier with the incremental profitability from every dollar of organic revenue growth is by far the most accretive thing we can do david raso okay and lastly i apologize if i missed it but the share repo for the quarter what was michael larsen  million in line with the planning that we lead out so think of the  billion as  million for a quarter is the way we’ve planned it out david raso that’s helpful okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of deane dray from rbc your line is now open deane dray i was hoping you’d give us update on price cost in the quarter and then the outlook given some of the changes for some of the raws like steel for the balance of the year michael larsen yeah deane so price cost like i said was  basis points for the quarter right in line with our planning assumptions right in line with what we saw last year and that remains our assumption for the rest of the year nothing unusual again this quarter by segment everything is on track so that’s the color i can give you deane dray got it and then just to go back on the comment at the beginning regarding the emphasis on gaap earnings and i think i certainly applaud that i know from a quality of earnings standpoint that gets recognized and so i was interested in hearing that you’re doing somewhat we would call quite restructuring in welding and you’ve sized that for us what’s the payback that you’re expecting on that and is there any other quite restructuring going on elsewhere in the segments michael larsen the payback is on this project is typically less than the year this one is actually quite a bit better than that it’s primarily focused on north america and we do disclose the last page in the press release lays out restructuring by segment and you can see the most significant one is welding this quarter like i said there’ll be another series of restructuring here in welding in q and that we’ll kind of update you as we go through the year deane dray and how much of that is cash michael larsen so it’s actually all cash but not significant i mean you look at how much cash we generate this does not don’t think if it is having an impact on our capital allocation strategy deane dray understood thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mig dobre from baird your line is now open mig dobre great thank you good morning maybe a clarification for me if you would looking at slide number five where you’re talking about your consumer and industrial businesses on a sequential basis so my understanding is that the sequential number that you’re providing are adjusted for seasonality for the footnote on the page i’m looking at industrial businesses being down  i think last quarter they were up  sequentially so i’m trying to sort of understand exactly what’s going on in these industrial businesses and in welding specifically because that appears to be the driver here are things getting incrementally worse in welding or was this simply that we had some sort of a pull forward of demand last quarter michael larsen no i wouldn’t say there was any pull forward in demand i mean the reason for the sequential decline is essentially all welding typically in q versus q like we said we would expect our welding business to be up  i mean it was actually down  test  measurement which is the other segment in here was essentially stable from q to q so it’s all welding driven mix mig dobre right and i guess the spirit of my question was there is a sense out there maybe things are stabilizing in some of these end markets that have been really challenged in  and in welding you’ve got exposure in a lot of them what’s your read through based on the way your business is progressing michael larsen i think as scott said earlier i think other than welding everything is stable and feels pretty firm as we start the year in welding we continue to see the impact on energy oil and gas which accounts for the decline on the international side general fabrication is still challenged especially going into mining agriculture heavy equipment so the demand environment in terms of capital equipment going into the industrial economy we would describe as still sluggish and as scott said we’ve not seen any sign yet of improvement at this point mig dobre okay and then maybe… michael larsen go ahead mig dobre the last thing is when you’re talking about volumes maybe being stable to slightly up in welding in the back half i’m trying to understand how you think about this business sequentially seasonally michael larsen yeah mig that’s purely a comparison current run rate so at current run rates if you run those out and you look at on a yearoveryear basis that’s when you get  decline organic in q you’ll get us another decline in q and then stable to up in the second half flat to up in the back half of the year at current runrate that can obviously change but at current run rates given the comparisons yearoveryear that’s what we would expect to see mig dobre okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of joel tiss from bmo your line is now open joel tiss alright thank you very much i just wondered if we can dig a little bit more into the food business and can you give us any color on the different end markets and what some of the drivers in the improvement were and what the outlook is going to the next couple of quarters ernest scott santi yeah so joe we feel very good about the first quarter particularly if you look at north america up  and the equipment side up  service from a product line standpoint refrigeration and cooking are the big drivers this quarter and then by end market it’s really healthcare and lodging continue to be solid for us but really across the board we feel very good about the outlook for the year we have a number of new products coming in here in q and so we’d expect that business to be up similar to last year in the  to  range as we talked about in the last call joel tiss okay can we do the same thing for polymers and fluids there are so many different end markets and different pieces can you just give us a little deeper color there too thank you ernest scott santi yeah what i would offer on polymers and fluids is it’s a basically an mro business two thirds of it the third is the automotive aftermarket piece the automotive aftermarket side of it they had a pretty solid quarter up  i think largely how i would characterize the overall growth performance on the quarter is they’ve gotten to the end of a pretty extensive pls process and are starting to now  the product line is much more stable than it’s been over the last eight quarters and they’re starting to now turn their attention more to growth and so very pleased to see positive overall organic out of that segment in the quarter joel tiss alright thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of andy casey from wells fargo your line is now open andy casey thanks good morning kind of a detail question to start the  basis point drag in components on margin that you call out on slide seven your mentioned the overhead inflation could you provide a little bit more detail on what’s driving that inflation michael larsen salary increases andy casey good for you guys then on the followup if we look at some of the macro data the inventory to sales ratios are relatively high in the us in some areas have you guys seen any change in customer inventory actions meaning destock restock or is it just pretty consistent based on your commentary about overall trends outside of welding michael larsen i’d say very consistent and you’re seeing little bit of seasonality in q but if you look at the first quarter relative to the first quarter last year really solid working capital performance and nothing unusual and just look at the free cash flow number  the average is about last few years has been  so really strong cash flow performance again in the first quarter and keep in mind that we typically ramp up from here so from a conversion standpoint this is typically our lowest quarter and then we will go up sequentially as we go through the year just typical seasonality so nothing unusual in terms of working capital continued strong performance andy casey okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve volkmann from jefferies your line is now open steve volkmann hi good morning scott i think you mentioned that the best return that you could come up with i am paraphrasing here was basically incremental margin on organic growth and i’m wondering if you’ve changed the way that you’re thinking about that and it seems like in  maybe we’ll get a little less pls headwind and maybe we get a little organic growth if we were to have a couple of points of organic growth in ‘ my number is not yours but what  how do you think about incrementals against that backdrop ernest scott santi well what i said was that the incremental profit from every dollar of incremental  dollar of organic revenue was the highest value opportunity that we had and really what we were focused on leveraging towards full potential not the percentage and we’ve talked about incremental margin so our target is roughly  going forward in terms of conversion to the bottom line from every incremental dollar of organic growth that will vary up or down a little bit depending on the segment and if anything i would expect we would comfortably do that or be even a little bit better given the elevated levels of profitability that we’re now operating at steve volkmann okay great that’s exactly what i was looking for and then just on test  measurement and electronics the absolute levels margin there is still not quite in line with some of your others and i know there is a fair amount of acquisition related intangibles et cetera but is that kind of an okay level in your mind for that business is that just kind of what that business can do or is there some sort of bigger picture thing that you can do to get that sort of more into the mids michael larsen so what i would say is  operating margin includes as you point out the  basis points of noncash amortization expense so you add that back it’s about  it’s still on the lower end inside of itw we expect all of our businesses continue to improve margins some will as you saw more than others and i would probably put test  measurement in that category of more margin potential than some of the other segments so we expect that segment to continue to improve on the margin side including in  as… ernest scott santi these amortization charges also bleed off over time michael larsen amortization charges as well as the enterprise initiatives exactly steve volkmann great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of sean williams from bbt capital markets your line is now open sean williams hi good morning michael larsen good morning sean williams wonder if we just maybe go back to food equipment certainly the margin improvements within that segment has been tremendous over last several years i just wonder if you could talk a little bit about kind of where we’d go from here i mean obviously the  i’d expect maybe further improvement in the back half of the year just kind of seasonal speaking but i don’t know can just talk about what are the kind of the big opportunities for food equipment given that you’re already kind of approaching bestinclass margins there ernest scott santi like i said i mean we expect all of our segments to improve including food equipment certainly good progress but also more to come and i think we’ll give you  if you look at the schedule and the back of the press release you can see the various components and so the margin expansion now is half is operating leverage and the other half approximately is the enterprise initiatives and within food equipments specifically yes so we’d expect that business to continue to improve sean williams alright that’s helpful and then could we just maybe come back and maybe your thoughts on kind of some of the overseas markets could you just maybe talk generally kind of industrial versus consumer facing for asia pacific i know that that look like sequentially it was down i know that was a tough comp but just where you’re seeing in asia pacific and then any green sheets in europe as well michael larsen so i wouldn’t  we’re not going parse it much more than what we did in the prepared remarks and what you can see on page six and the outlook for the rest of the year in the asia pacific is growth rates very similar to what we saw here in the q certainly encouraged by china automotive of  as well as continued progress on the  in construction products which as may know is primarily australia based so that’s how we would describe that sean williams and then any thoughts on europe michael larsen europe i think for the year we expect very similar again to q so up in the very low singledigits based on current run rates sean williams alright thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jamie cook from credit suisse your line is now open jamie cook hi good morning just two quick clarifications one i think within auto you talked about in your prepared remarks being able to grow i think  to  points better than whatever the market is doing just in terms of the clarification does that include the auto acquisition or is that exclusive of the auto acquisition and then last just another question on the guide i’m sort of struggling with how you don’t get to the mid or high end given the first quarter given fx given commentary industrialist very stable outside of welding i mean what i’m just trying to figure out what you did in your repo is what price cost be the biggest risk i’m just trying to get a sense of what you’re most concerned about thanks ernest scott santi on the first question that growth target we talked about is it does not include the acquisition that’s core organic and that’s our expectation both for ‘ and our longer term growth target for the auto oem segment with respect to the balance of the year michael talked about it before the currency is there is no win in trying to forecast where currency goes so we’ve always sort of use current run rates on currency we use obviously at the quarterly levels they move around so there is  we are not going to forward forecast where currency is going to be michael’s comment was that if everything stayed exactly where it was  two comments that i’ll repeat one is that we are impacted by more than just the euro aussie dollar canadian dollar also reasonably material factors as is the pound and then the other part of that is if everything stay exactly where it is and i don’t know if you marking the market today michael but around right now that there is probably a few pennies of upside is on the full year basis who knows if that will happen and may go the other… jamie cook i just wanted to get a sense more on the end market side because again consumer is pretty good outside of welding industrial is pretty stable and i’m just more on an end market or geography where you are most concerned ernest scott santi i think generally speaking we are feeling like the first quarter was pretty solid pretty firm we have talked about this before we are basically taking current run rates and projecting those through the year and that’s how we derive our growth and earnings forecast for the year so if things stay where they are today we’re in pretty solid shape jamie cook okay thanks a lot ernest scott santi yeah jamie cook thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ann duignan from jpmorgan your line is now open ann duignan hi good morning one of my questions has been answered but maybe taking jaime’s question and asking it a slightly different way what would have to happen for you to come in at the low end of your q guidance and then the high end of your q guidance what are you contemplating in those ranges ernest scott santi the drivers would be of variance from current run rates either better or worse than what we see today so that would be the primary driver i think on the things that are within our own control in terms of the so called selfhelp enterprise initiatives we feel very good about continuing to execute the way we have for the last since we embarked on the enterprise strategy so i think those are on the margin side very solid michael larsen the delta is the demand side ernest scott santi right ann duignan but within which segments when you are putting your plan together where do you think the down side risk is where do you think the up side risk is ernest scott santi i think here is what i’d say i would say one of the real strengths of the company and we talked about this is really well balanced diversified high quality portfolio of businesses and so if certain things are better than run rates in one part of the company it will offset in other preexisting and so i wouldn’t  i can’t go down the path by segment how we think about this ann duignan okay and maybe as a followup and within welding it does seem to be the one segment where maybe you are not as upbeat about where things are can you just talk about  a little bit about the difference we are seeing in oil and gas at this point versus you did talk about fabrication for mining and heavy equipment have any of those endmarkets gotten incrementally worse or is it just they’re bad and they aren’t getting any better ernest scott santi i think like we said earlier i mean welding did decelerate in q versus q and when you look at the yearoveryear decline the more than half of that organic decline is oil and gas so that is the main driver and it like we said earlier we haven’t seen any signs that things are getting better there yet ann duignan and on the industrial side ernest scott santi those are fairly stable the decline is primarily on the oil and gas side so… ann duignan okay thank you i leave it there operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven fisher from ubs your line is now open steven fisher great thanks good morning i just want to come back to the price cost that deane was asking about before because the cost have risen as the core has gone along so maybe how are the pricing discussions going at the start of q are those adjusting kind of in real time to more than offset the higher input cost how do you keep that price cost stable michael larsen well i mean i am not sure how to answer that other than what i said earlier in my prepared remarks and the response to deane’s question price cost was favorable  points no change and we expect it to remain at  basis points as we go through the year and if that changes we’ll let you know over the next earnings call but we don’t expect it to steven fisher and so basically it sounds like you’re able to raise prices to offset the costs as it increased michael larsen if you look at our historical performance and what i just said that would be the conclusion yes steven fisher okay and then just summarize this i know it’s been discussed before but does your base case assume that the industrial facing businesses exist the year neutral or positive or there will it still be declining ernest scott santi well the base case is take the order rates where you’re getting today on a daily basis and project them through the end of the year the comps get easier as michael said but we are projecting no acceleration or further deceleration from here and we’ve talked about that before we are a fast reactor we’re not a predictor on the future so embedded in both our organic numbers and our eps forecast is an assumption that demand stays exactly where it is today across all seven segments projected out through the rest of the year steven fisher so will the comps get you to neutral in industrial facing by exiting the year then ernest scott santi it may be close steven fisher okay thank you ernest scott santi great and that takes us to the top of the hour we appreciate everybody’s time this morning and have an outstanding day operator

the press releaseso with that ill turn the call over to scotternest scott santi  president chief executive officer  directorthanks aaron and good morning everyone in the face of a fairly unprecedented combination of currency translation headwinds and contracting demand in two of the companys highest growth core businesses itw delivered another solid quarter of execution with earnings per share of  an increase of  over the last year excluding the  negative impact of currency translation our earnings per share would have been up  operating margin in the quarter was up  basis points yearonyear and operating margin of  was a new alltime record for the company in addition aftertax return on invested capital reached our enterprise strategy target of  plusdespite the current challenges associated with the external environment we continue to focus on and invest in our strategy to accelerate organic revenue growth across the company in the first half of  we invested roughly  million in our businesses as we added capital equipment to expand capacity launched new products and continued to simplify our businesses in order to focus them on their largest and most compelling growth opportunities our pivot and focus to organic growth is already delivering solid abovemarket growth in our automotive oem and food equipment segments and we saw nice improvement in the organic growth rate in our construction segment this quarter as a result we now have three of our seven segments growing organically in the midtoupper singledigit rangerevenues in our welding segment and test  measurement platform were down significantly in q welding down  and test  measurement down  as both businesses are seeing contracting demand from the oil and gas sector and the continued soft capital spending environment for industrial equipment more generally both of these businesses have traditionally been among itws fastest and most consistent organic growers and we believe that the longterm fundamentals for growth and profitability in both of these businesses remain very strong as a result we continue to invest to ensure that they are well positioned to return to their historic growth rates as conditions in their end markets improveas we wrap up the second quarter of  we are also at the halfway point of our fiveyear enterprise strategy and while we have a lot of work left to do weve made substantial progress in executing our strategy to position itw to deliver solid abovemarket growth with bestinclass margins and returns on capital weve divested over  businesses including two full segments in conjunction with our portfolio strategy to focus the company exclusively on businesses that have strong and sustainable differentiation attributesour business teams are currently executing the product line level component of this strategy through our product line simplification initiative as a result itw today has a much more differentiated set of businesses with better overall earnings quality and significantly higher organic growth potential as an aside and as an illustration of the significantly higher overall level of quality of the itw business portfolio last year itws operating income of  billion was an alltime record for the company the prior record of  billion was set in  when the companys revenues were  billion higher so in other words last year we made more money than we ever had in the history of the company and revenues that were  billion lower than the prior recordour focus now will increasingly turn to leveraging this much higher quality business portfolio into accelerated organic growth activities associated with business structure simplification are starting to lessen with significant incremental benefits still to come strategic

thanks aaron and good morning overall we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the fullyear as we continued to execute on our enterprise strategy and deliver strong results in a challenging but stable environment in  itw grew earnings per share  expanded operating margins by  basis points to a record of  and improved aftertax return on invested capital by  basis points to a record  free cash flow was strong in  at a  of net income and we invested roughly  million in our businesses for growth and productivity in addition we returned more than  billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in  we continued to make significant progress on the execution of our enterprise strategy as evidenced by more than  basis points of margin improvement from our selfhelp enterprise initiatives as a reminder we expect an additional incremental  basis points of margin expansion from our business structure simplification sourcing and  excellence initiatives in each of  and  in  we also began our pivot to focus on our organic growth agenda and we made meaningful progress with  of the companys revenues achieving readytogrow status and  growing at  in  we continue to execute the various elements of our enterprise strategy in a wellplanned and logical sequence as we position itw to deliver solid growth with bestinclass margins and returns and we remain firmly on track to deliver on our end of  enterprise performance goals id like to close by thanking all of our itw colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy ill now turn the call over to michael and then ill be back to discuss the acquisition that we announced earlier this week michael michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you scott and good morning everybody as you saw this morning itw delivered another strong quarter eps of  increased  versus prior year  excluding currency our results were driven by strong execution across the board as operating margin improved  basis points to  and our selfhelp enterprise initiatives contributed  basis points of improvement organic revenue was modestly better than our guidance with some credit challenging comparisons in a few segments while demand for capital equipment remains sluggish underlying demand trends were stable across our business portfolio adjusted for seasonality demand in our industrial businesses improved  sequentially in q versus q free cash flow was very strong at  of net income and as you can see we made meaningful progress on our return on invested capital metrics in summary stable demand across our business portfolio and solid execution drove strong q performance turning to revenue by geography on page five let me just remind you that the organic revenue number includes a one percentage point impact from product line simplification as organic revenue declined  with some fairly challenging comparisons in the prior year by geography north america was down  with our consumer facing businesses up  and the industrial businesses down  international was positive up  with europe middle east and africa up  our consumer businesses grew  with strength in automotive oem up  in europe and food equipment asia pacific and china were essentially flat and its worth pointing out that china automotive was up  in the fourth quarter so overall stable endmarket conditions across the portfolio and slightly betterthanexpected organic revenue performance in the quarter against a fairly challenging comparison on page six strong operating margin performance once again in the quarter operating margin of  improved  basis points and four segments improved between  basis points and  basis points driven primarily by our selfhelp enterprise initiatives and lower restructuring pricing was solid in the quarter pricecost was favorable  basis points so strong progress on operating margin and as scott said were on track to realize additional incremental margin improvement as we go forward on page seven we listed fullyear  operating margin by segment and you can see the strong progress since the launch of the enterprise strategy turning to the segments starting with automotive oem another strong quarter organic revenue up  and up  for the year outpacing worldwide builds of  europe was up  organically in the quarter and up  for the year north america was up  and china was up  in the quarter and up  for the year consistent with global industry growth rates our  guidance assumes a  increase in global auto builds versus  solid quarter in test  measurementelectronics as margin improved  basis points to a new fourth quarter record of  demand trends in this segment improved in the quarter sequentially from q to q revenues were up  up  adjusted for typical seasonality also another solid quarter in food equipment up  organically facing some challenging comparisons from last year you may recall that equipment was up  worldwide in q last year operating margin improved  basis points to a new fourth quarter record of  north america service was up  and underlying equipment demand remained solid particularly in bakery healthcare and lodging international equipment was up  on continued strong demand in warewash cooking and refrigeration polymers  fluids was down  due to soft demand related to industrial mro with north america down  partially offset by asia pacific up  operating margin expanded by  basis points to  welding was down  organically in a tough environment and against some challenging comparisons you may recall that in the fourth quarter last year north america was up  and oil and gas was up  the  yearoveryear decline breaks down as  points from oil and gas  points from industrial and  points from commercial north america overall was down  with consumables essentially flat international as you can see was down  due to oil and gas primarily in onshore pipeline and offshore but as weve talked about on the last earnings calls the yearoveryear numbers can be somewhat misleading in terms of understanding the underlying trends on a seasonally adjusted basis the underlying demand trends have actually been fairly stable since the first quarter of  on a seasonally adjusted sequential basis we saw a significant stepdown in demand in q last year followed by slight declines in q and q and then in this fourth quarter demand actually improved  sequentially from q consistent with current demand levels our  guidance assumes a singledigit decline in the welding segment on slide  construction products had another strong quarter on the top line and bottom line organic revenue was up  and margin was up  basis points north america was up  with highsingledigit growth in the renovation and remodel channel residential was essentially flat and commercial was down slightly asia pacific was strong up  due to australia in specialty products organic revenue was flat with solid growth in consumer packaging offset by the impact of product line simplification operating margin improved by  basis points  turning to slide  as you know one of the core strengths of itw is our diversified portfolio and in the current environment the fact that about  of our revenues are consumer facing as you can see in a tough environment our consumer businesses automotive oem food equipment portions of specialty products and construction are growing at an organic rate of  in the fourth quarter and for the fullyear and the seasonally adjusted sequential trends are stable our industrial businesses welding test  measurement and electronics were down  in the quarter and down  for the year however if you look at the seasonally adjusted sequential trend from q to q revenues are up  in simple terms based on typical seasonality you would expect these businesses to be down  sequentially but they were actually up  it may be too early to call this a trend but certainly an encouraging data point as we look ahead quickly on  you can see that we continue to make significant progress on all of our financial performance metrics eps growth operating margin improvement return on capital and free cash flow all reflect the strength of itws differentiated business model and our strong execution in a tough environment going back a little bit further to the launch of the enterprise strategy on slide  the same holds true more than  basis points improvement in margin and returns  eps cagr and solid progress in our pivot to growth as scott said  of the companys revenues achieved readytogrow status and  grew at  in  we fully expect that  of the companys revenues will be in readytogrow status by the end of  in summary over the last three years really good progress and weve done everything we said we would do and were on track to achieve our  performance goals on slide  we are reaffirming the guidance as discussed in new york on december  our organic revenue growth expectation of  to  is in line with q demand levels and includes  basis points of product line simplification impact  in  we expect  basis points or more of margin improvement from our selfhelp enterprise initiatives independent of volume and operating margin is projected to be a new record of approximately  earnings per share in the range of  to  and  growth at the midpoint and  growth excluding currency turning to the first quarter our eps guidance is  to  and the midpoint of  represents  of our fullyear earnings right in line with historical patterns again we expect  basis points from our selfhelp enterprise initiatives and based on current levels of demand we expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up  finally a quick update on capital allocation given the two recent developments and then ill hand it over to scott earlier this week we announced the acquisition of the engineered fasteners  components business from zf trw for  million from a capital allocation standpoint approximately  of the purchase price will be funded with nonus cash and we expect the acquisition to generate returns on capital in the  to  range by year seven in addition we see significant potential to improve the performance of the efc business through the application of itws  business management system and we expect margins to improve from approximately  to  by year five the acquisition is slightly accretive to eps in the first  months and based on the expected closing date we expect very little eps impact in  with accelerating benefits into  and beyond finally were maintaining our end of  performance goals second based on our ability to taxefficiently accessed  billion of nonus cash this month were increasing our share repurchase expectation by  billion to approximately  billion the associated eps benefit for  is largely offset by recent currency moves but this additional  billion of share repurchase also positions us very well for earnings growth in  and beyond with that ill turn it scott ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director thanks michael and just now a couple of words on the acquisition that we announced earlier this week on slide  let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are holding on this acquisition to our automotive oem segment as many of you know we have a very focused niche strategy in this space we are essentially a high velocity serial problem solver for oem and tier suppliers the segment in  had  billion of revenue and an  organic growth cagr since  as we have talked on a number of occasions we see very attractive longterm growth opportunities in this space within itws very focused niche positioning and have demonstrated some real ability to execute on that strategy over the last four years or five years as weve talked about on a number of occasions and weve outgrown global auto builds by over  basis points on average since  so the addition of the zf – the engineered fasteners  components business from zf trw essentially gives us some additional leverage on that strategy broadens our market positions on slide  a very complementary business in terms of strategy and focus this business is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and technical components largely focused on the interior of the car business is headquartered in germany  manufacturing facilities and  employees globally very strong solid business excellent customer relationships very capable operating team and a very strong proven track record around quality and delivery execution throughout their history on slide  sic  in terms of what does this business do in terms of adding to our current position a couple of key points in that regard first of all it adds several new strategic product platforms that have similar characteristics through the core product platforms that we support today certainly have very demonstrated track record in terms of innovation the business is bringing with it over  active patents and from the standpoint of the manufacturing customer support footprint very tilted towards asia so it supplements our position in asia the overall business is standpoint of revenue by geography is  europe  north america  in asia pacific so very complementary to our geographic footprint which is a little more weighted towards north america so it gives us better global balance overall and certainly the last point is we see significant potential to leverage our  business management process in terms of helping the efc business continue to improve its operating metrics operating margins on the way in  are about  and as michael talked about we think we have line of sight on at least doubling that rate over the first five years of ownership from the standpoint of the transaction components purchase price is roughly one times sales michael talked about the nearterm accretion certainly modestly positive in the first  months including all noncash acquisition accounting related costs certainly expect to generate returns on capital well within our target over the first seven years to  years of the acquisition michael talked about our ability to fund  or so of the purchase price with nonus cash which is an acquisition from a strategic and operational and return standpoint that we would have done regardless of funding sources but certainly the ability to use a significant portion of the purchase cost the ability to use cash overseas is certainly an added benefit here but didnt drive the deal and we expect to close in the second half of – or this first half of  so with that i think were – thats all for our prepared remarks and well be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you are we going to proceed with the questionandanswer session aaron h hoffman  vice presidentinvestor relations yes lets begin the question and answer thank you operator youre welcome one moment our first question will be coming from the line of joe ritchie of goldman sachs sir your line is open joseph alfred ritchie  goldman sachs  co thanks good morning guys ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director good morning michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning joseph alfred ritchie  goldman sachs  co and nice quarter maybe starting on the  guide you maintain the guide and it seems like youve built some margin of error in the guide also with this  billion repatriation and so maybe talk a little bit about your opportunity to still hit at least the midpoint maybe even the higher end of the guide if in fact organic growth were to disappoint as we kind of progress through the year michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah joe id say on the organic  to  guide for  is based on the demand levels were seeing in the businesses today as per usual so were not counting on improvement in underlying demand or in market conditions based on current run rates we are solidly in that range of  to  i think in terms of margin of error what i would say is that we still have a lot of things that are within our control in terms of our selfhelp and number one on the list are the enterprise initiatives that weve continued to execute well on over the last two years and we expect another  basis points of margin expansion independent of volume from those in  if you translate that into eps as we said in december thats about  of eps growth certainly in addition to that the  billion increase in our share repurchase program gives us some additional eps benefit unfortunately some of that is depending on the timing is offset by recent currency moves not so much in the euro but primarily in canadian and australian dollars the pound but it does give us a little bit of room here so overall in terms of the guidance we feel very good about maintaining where were at in the  to  range and we feel really good about continuing to make solid progress on organic growth you saw some of that in the fourth quarter and just based on what were seeing in our businesses today wed expect that to continue in  joseph alfred ritchie  goldman sachs  co thats helpful color michael maybe as my followon question theres a lot of concern in the market regarding whats happening in the auto end market clearly thats an end market that has been incredibly good for you guys you continue to outpace global auto builds but it looks like this past quarter we saw a little bit less outgrowth in auto oem so maybe some color on your ability to continue to sustain outgrowth in that end market and how you think about that end market over the next  months ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director yes sure joe this is scott i think the story for us remains one of penetration michael made a comment in his prepared remarks that our planning scenario essentially is for  increase in global auto builds next year i think most of the sort of external forecasters and pundits are in the  to  range so in our own planning assumptions i think were taking a much more conservative approach as a baseline it is also as we talked about before the one area of our business where we have a significant amount of forward visibility visàvis weve sold programs into production plans going on this year those programs were sold two years and three years ago so i think weve got a pretty stable outlook on in terms of what our expectations are for  with respect to auto built into our plans it doesnt mean that builds if we see some inflection in – or some change in overall builds relative to our  thats not going to have an impact but ultimately i think the potential impacts are pretty modest i think weve got our plan set where theres an appropriate level of conservatism and have enough new penetration and new content in  coming online that we ought to be able to be all right regardless of – pending any sort of major crash which i dont think anybody thinks is going to happen i think were in pretty good position in  joseph alfred ritchie  goldman sachs  co okay great thanks scott ill get back in queue operator all right thank you our next question will be coming from the line of andrew kaplowitz of citigroup your line is open andrew kaplowitz  citigroup global markets inc broker hey good morning guys nice quarter scott so can you talk a little bit more about the pivot to growth how much more challenging do you think it could be to get your businesses that are preparing to grow to get ready to grow by the end of  as you talked about in the analyst day if the global economy is a bit weaker and maybe you can talk about what these businesses are if i look at it it seems like itd be businesses like european construction parts of polymers and fluids parts of specialty products but thats what i think what do you think ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director yeah i think youve hit – in terms of those three areas of the company i think youve hit three that are still in the preparing to grow mode the agenda is pretty much within our own control from the standpoint of what we have characterized as moving from preparing to grow to ready to grow its largely a lot of  work a lot of product line pruning a lot of customer focus and a lot of – as we talked in december a lot on really lasering in on where are the best opportunities to grow so i dont think theres much impact on the preparation part from the standpoint of the external environment that agenda is pretty well mapped out the timing is in terms of the sequencing of various parts of the company from that prepared to grow to ready to grow just a function of how big the agenda was to get from a to b and in some cases we had further to go than others so the  weve gotten in that mode to this point had a slightly less deep agenda and were working our way through the rest so i dont think theres much impact in terms of the external environment in terms of the objective that we have laid out to get  of our businesses in that mode by the end of this year that being said certainly the external environment from the standpoint of yield on that investment is certainly going to have an impact in the short run a little bit of tailwind at some point here would certainly help us showcase the progress were making but i think id also make the other point that the fact that were able to grow  of our sales in this environment at a  clip in  is a pretty good indicator of at least some progress in that regard andrew kaplowitz  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks for that scott and scott or michael can i ask you about pricecost you had a minor improvement in pricecost from  basis points to  basis points but as you know raw material costs do seem to be coming down maybe a little more significantly now so can you actually improve that pricecost from  basis points that you had in q or at least maintain it for the year michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so i think obviously andrew its not the main driver of our margin performance here thats really enterprise initiatives but we were pleased to see  basis points in the fourth quarter that was our best result in  and the average for the year is  basis points and thats what we modeled for  i think we were all encouraged to see solid price across the portfolio again a lot of it driven by the launch of new products as weve talked about before and were starting to see the deflation come through on some of the key raw materials that were buying in some cases we pass those on to customers were contractually obligated so obviously well do that but there is a little bit more of sort of an improvement in the overall equation here in the fourth quarter hopeful that we can maintain that were certainly working very hard on that and were counting on  basis points in the guide for  andrew kaplowitz  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks michael take care guys operator okay thank you our next question will be coming from the line of john inch of deutsche bank sir your line is open john g inch  deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks very much okay so i want to – good morning everyone i want to pick up on this auto thematic i mean lets be blunt it was very clear your stock was shorted earlier this year because of this perceived exposure your auto business is going to fall off a cliff and i understand your confidence based on your track record and your ability to continue to penetrate it my question is do you see anything scott or michael based on your operations that give you a little more comfort than simply the trend in other words do you have – and i realize youve got a little bit of a backlog look forward but are there initiatives that youre working on that may be derivative of say cafe standards or vehicle electrification or youre working on a big something in indonesia or something like that that you think maybe give you – maybe not dramatically but like a point or two of stepup help over the coming cycle michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president i wouldnt put indonesia on the high priority list john g inch  deutsche bank securities inc i just meant – that was the only thing that came to mind but you know ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director but other than that i think we have – i think i get it your question if i dont answer it let me know but what i would say is we have a very full pipeline over of engineering and product development activity related to automotive thats certainly driven by some of the things you talked about and just other changes in the need profile of our oem customers in terms of new features new technologies new things that theyre looking to add so i think we have a very solid view of the next  years in the space in terms of what the opportunities are for our particular niche in the space and i think thats – this is not – we dont manage any of our businesses for the next two quarters we manage them for the long haul i think this is an area where we remain as weve talked before very optimistic about our ability to continue to increase our content per vehicle focusing on a very narrowly defined strategy in terms of what we do and so all i can tell you is that the pipeline in terms of the amount of activity in terms of projects were working on that are going to come to fruition two years and three years and four years out remains very healthy we track it we monitor it so i think we are on top of sort of what the future might hold in terms of opportunity for us here michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president and john maybe ill just add that for those that are maybe a little more shortterm focused we have not seen any signs of a slowdown in the fourth quarter or yeartodate in the automotive space or across our business portfolio john g inch  deutsche bank securities inc let me just ask kind of a followup this german company youve bought right its going to give you a leg up into asia and obviously itw as youre pivoting with cost and simplification youre going to be doing more ma is there runway to do other kinds of deals like this perhaps to extend what clearly is then a successful ma – or excuse me penetration track record in auto into other markets like i dont know for example japan or something i mean just i realize you cant talk specifically but maybe the question was more the deal that you did was it more oneoff or do you think that there are other things and just as a followup i mean having a little bit of experience with german companies im assuming that company has a lot of potential productivity or cost efficiency opportunities can you still grow it at that cadence and expand the margins ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director trying to think about where to start with that one john g inch  deutsche bank securities inc sorry multipart second part ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director yes so i think our overall story in automotive is largely an organic one i think this particular business from the standpoint of complementary fit with our strategy is a unique opportunity i would certainly not rule out other opportunities like this but i think its not a matter of – its not the scale were after here its really about sort of auto opportunities where we can extend our access to the key oems and extend our ability to play across a range of different product platforms that we think fit the overall screen in terms of high valueadded content so we talked about the organic growth rate in auto oem i think thats largely that remains the thrust here so thats the overall focus and the story is we have significant opportunity to continue to grow and add content per vehicle and do it in a way thats certainly consistent with our overall enterprise performance goals that being said would we look at something that gave us a similar opportunity to extend our reach in some other geography sure john g inch  deutsche bank securities inc or technology perhaps i mean i wont – mobileye comes to mind only because its been so topical im not talking about that company specifically but maybe breakthrough technology is that a possibility ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director im not sure i heard who the company was i wouldnt comment on it i dont think its – i think well assess each opportunity on its own i dont want to overplay this i think our primary thrust is – and focus continues to be on leveraging and executing the strategy that we have so we dont need any more ma to continue to generate really strong organic growth at really nice incremental yield so i would say our thrust here would be more opportunistic than any view that we have to do anything more here so if opportunities present themselves that we think that will certainly do it but we have no particular view of were deficient we need this or we have to have that in order to be very successful here over the long haul john g inch  deutsche bank securities inc no i got it and mobileye was the company i called out thanks very much i appreciate it ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director sure operator thank you our next question will be coming from the line of scott davis of barclays your line is open scott reed davis  barclays capital inc hi good morning guys ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director good morning scott reed davis  barclays capital inc im new to your story so im allowed to ask dumb questions for a couple of quarters i hope you guys forgive me ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director sure scott reed davis  barclays capital inc but can you give us a sense – you seem to have a fair amount of confidence in the  to  q guide i mean january is a fairly important month in the quarter were already on this th are you tracking in that range in january and that gives you the confidence michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah scott were on track in january for the guidance that we gave for the first quarter scott reed davis  barclays capital inc okay thats helpful and then second question just following up a little on what john was saying i mean this trw deal looks like just a fantastic deal i mean if theres other stuff out there like this would you be willing to – i mean would it make sense at least to think about not doing the share repurchase and adding the higher return profile instead michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president i think scott we really – absolutely we will continue to look at acquisitions where we can – that meet the criteria that we talked about in december so really the primary purpose here is to support or accelerate our organic growth rate and were looking for businesses where we can have significant impact from an  standpoint and so to the extent that we see those well certainly continue to work on that in terms of overall capital allocation nothing has changed in terms of our structure and strategy as you know we have a strong balance sheet we have strong liquidity we generate a lot of cash flow you saw  in the quarter  for the year and so we have a lot of options and so for us its not a question of eitheror we can do all of the above and what weve said is to the extent that we dont identify acquisitions that meet the criteria that i just described then we make a choice to return that cash to our shareholders through an active share repurchase program and as you saw we just raised that today from a  billion to  billion for  so thats how we think about it scott reed davis  barclays capital inc okay that seems to make sense and then just a quick one how much of the basispoint margin of the year you think was pricecost related or lifo accounting related or something related to that michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president so pricecost was  basis points and the primary driver was  basis points from the enterprise initiatives scott reed davis  barclays capital inc okay perfect all right thanks guys appreciate it michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president okay thank you operator thank you and our next question will be coming from the line of deane dray of rbc your line is open deane dray  rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning everyone ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director good morning deane dray  rbc capital markets llc hey i just want to circle back to the zf deal scott its pretty clear this is a natural fit for you guys but i didnt hear any specifics regarding what the products are theres a vague description of strategic product platforms but if you can get down to the level of the  the  that really matter compared to like lifttosits handles fuel caps what is it adding to the portfolio and are there any redundancies michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president so this is michael deane so if you think about it  million in revenues half of that is what we would describe as fastening systems and that not to get too technical here certainly im not the right person for that but theyre described broadly as fasteners for trim pipe and hose hole plugs and wire harnesses the other half is what is described as technical components so this is again in the interior of the vehicle – air registers interior ventilation systems lighting and other interior products so theres a really nice fit with what we know really well and do very well inside of our current automotive business deane dray  rbc capital markets llc just in the description michael there are overlaps the way it sounds in terms of the fasteners and even some of the air handling do you have a sense of how much specific overlap there is michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president i think overlap is not a good characterization every one of these products is customdesigned around a particular model so were sort of describing them in broad category so theyre areas that we know we know fastening very well in automotive but there are hundreds of fastening applications on every car so every product line here is a specifically designed and engineered solution to a specific problem on a specific model for a specific oem so these are sort of areas that were very familiar with in broad terms but from the standpoint of are there any exact likelike products minimal to none deane dray  rbc capital markets llc thats great to hear and thats a good perspective and then just my followup question would be for michael on the repatriated cash whats the effective tax rate that you paid on bringing this cash back and maybe are you netting it against any tax losses but just when you say its taxefficient what did you have to pay michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so we paid very little and you saw that in our tax rate last year we had a similar transaction in the quarter last year our rate for the last year was  for the year in that  to  range and for  we expect to be in that same range  to  including in the first quarter so like we said this was done in a very taxefficient very simple transaction it makes a lot of sense operationally and a really good outcome for the company deane dray  rbc capital markets llc and michael im sorry to try to pin you down on this when you say very little what tax rate – effective tax rate are you paying to bring this cash back michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president essentially zero deane dray  rbc capital markets llc terrific okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question will be coming from the line of mr mig dobre of robert baird your line is open mig dobre  robert w baird  co inc broker yes thank you good morning everyone i guess my question relates to slide  in the deck looking at industrial and consumer sequentially so for your industrial businesses youre up  adjusted for seasonality maybe kind of nitpicking a little bit if welding was flat and test  measurement were up  can you give us a sense for what else sort of grew to get you to the plus  and then related to this im trying to understand if this is just something thats specific to the company either through new product introduction or your exposure or are you trying to signal that theres something bigger going on in the environment its a little different than what were hearing from other industrial companies in terms of what happens michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president mig all were saying is that as we talked about on the last earnings call is that what we have seen in our businesses on the industrial side is that trends stabilize really starting in the second quarter last year and so if you just take welding to maybe illustrate this so if you look at the sequential demand trends in welding what we saw in the first quarter was a  decline in the demand rate into the second quarter into the third quarter we saw  all seasonally adjusted and then in the fourth quarter we saw flat and so that means that we would expect typical seasonality in welding we expect that business to be down  and the business was flat so thats certainly an improvement in terms of the underlying demand trends ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director and part of what i would add to that is theres a lot of volatility in the comps given just the volatility in the endmarket so we talked about fourth quarter last year so what were trying just communicate is not any big change in trend as much as when you look at the yearonyear comps quarterbyquarter because of the volatility over the last eight quarters to  quarters those arent necessarily indicative of whats going on currently and essentially what were seeing is relatively stable demand on a orders per day basis so were not calling it a trend were not calling it a pickup but what we are saying is things have been relatively stable michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah and mig a point on the consumer side is really that this is a little bit different as you were saying relative to maybe some of our peers that  of our revenues are tied to the consumer and that in the current environment where theres some pressure on the industrial side particularly capex into oil and gas and we have  of the company growing at  at a very stable rate for the quarter and for the year so those are the points were trying to make on slide  mig dobre  robert w baird  co inc broker okay i appreciate that and then i know you commented on pricecost but if we can focus on just price specifically in your industrial businesses are there some parallels that you can draw between the current environment versus maybe prior downturns where things were challenging hows pricing behaving versus history here michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president no change here mig i mean we saw across the portfolio the ability to get price based on offering valueadded products and solutions we saw no change in the quarter so really nothing different here mig dobre  robert w baird  co inc broker all right thanks operator thank you our next question will be coming from the line of david raso of evercore isi david raso  evercore isi institutional equities hi good morning operator your line is open david raso  evercore isi institutional equities so two questions one positive i guess one negative but first a clarification maybe i missed it ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director thanks for the warning david raso  evercore isi institutional equities the guidance does it not include the auto acquisition just so were clear michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president no the guidance today does not include the acquisition but what we did say is that we expect minimal eps impact in  this is really more of a  and beyond eps growth story and so when the transaction closes which we expect will happen in the first half of the year we will update revenue margin guidance we expect some but very little impact on the eps side and well give you all that once the transaction closes david raso  evercore isi institutional equities all right thank you on the positive side the organic growth guidance for the first quarter was stronger than i would have thought is it fair to say the tone at the december meeting when you thought about the cadence for  organic to get to the fullyear midpoint of up  that the first quarter organic guidance you just gave is maybe a little better than you were thinking a month or two ago michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president id say not really david i mean id say the fourth quarter here was a little bit better than our guidance at the beginning of the quarter but that wasnt really a big surprise to us and again what were doing is were taking typical seasonality run rates from q adjusted for seasonality into q and that gets you into that  to  range so theres nothing really different about it david raso  evercore isi institutional equities okay i have to admit i was thinking that it was a very back half loaded guide in the sense of first half organic maybe down a bit second half would have to be up a lot but it sounds like now the cadence sounds a little more   is kind of the generic base case of the cadence to get the fullyear  ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director yeah yeah but again its much more about the – because of the comparison to the comps were taking current daily run rates and applying basically what were saying in  is – no change in current run rates gets us  to  for the year michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president and so based on that i mean the way youre looking at it david i mean this is not a backend loaded plan in terms of the organic or the eps guidance david raso  evercore isi institutional equities yeah i mean i will say i left the meeting thinking it was even more backhalf loaded than the setup youre describing today on the negative side obviously a lot of positive commentary you have on auto versus the concerns but still end of the day the quarter the outgrowth wasnt quite as great as weve seen and the margins still were down so maybe i missed it in the prepared remarks but can you help us understand why the margin was down and how do you see auto margins for  versus  youre saying worldwide builds up  i assume you expect to outgrow so call it    kind of revenue growth for auto how do the margins play out in that scenario michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so our margins i mean it can vary a little bit on a quarterly basis i would point to  operating margin in auto for the year great progress thats how i would think about  with some progress on the enterprise initiatives for the year  organic growth on builds of   in the quarter there can be some mix issues like we talked about in the third quarter and so i wouldnt read too much into david the one particular quarter but really encourage you to look at it kind of on an annual basis and wed certainly expect something very similar in  scott walked through the penetration and the auto build dynamics but it should be another solid year for the auto business david raso  evercore isi institutional equities thats helpful but just so i make sure i heard you correctly the  and then you made a comment about enterprise initiatives the  includes enterprise initiatives or is that base and then whatever you can provide  michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president the  is the performance for the fullyear in  david raso  evercore isi institutional equities correct michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president and like all of our businesses we would expect some progress on margins in  some more than others david raso  evercore isi institutional equities okay thats helpful helpful just wanted to clarify thank you very much operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of joel tiss your line is open joel gifford tiss  bmo capital markets united states hey guys hows it going ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director good joel gifford tiss  bmo capital markets united states just quick for mike just a clarification you said the consumer facing businesses are stable does that mean that theyre up  theyre stable at an up  run rate for  or theyre stable closer to flat for  versus the up  in  michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president no when we say stable what we mean is the underlying demand trends adjusted for seasonality from q to q we saw stable demand in those businesses so joel gifford tiss  bmo capital markets united states and you said – oh go ahead sorry michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president now it doesnt mean that we expect the consumer businesses to be flat in  were certainly not giving guidance for consumer and industrial for  but if you think about whats in there so automotive we talked about food equipment we talked about parts of construction and specialty wed certainly expect those businesses to grow again in  joel gifford tiss  bmo capital markets united states okay and then just a strategic question on the debt you were saying in december that you were hoping to use the free cash flow to pay down debt and i see that your cash is coming down a little bit and your debts going up and i just wondered if theres any change in that thinking going into  michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president i think joel i think you were saying that i dont think i said that at the december meeting so we have like i said earlier i mean we have our current debt to ebitda is in that  range and we expect no changes to that joel gifford tiss  bmo capital markets united states okay all right thank you operator thank you our next question will be coming from the line of andy casey of wells fargo securities andrew m casey  wells fargo securities llc thanks good morning everybody first question on the acquisition could you help us kind of frame the historical growth rate over the last three years was it even close to the  cagr achieved by your auto business and then also based on your initial meetings with the organization over there so far is your impression that they have the embedded skillset right now to drive both margin improvement and ultimately above market growth kind of in line with corporate goals ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director yeah so the answer to the first question is the growth rate has been solid but not at the rate that weve been growing over the last four years we expect to have some – offer some help in that regard and then the second question is that weve been very impressed with the management team in the organization and feel like were getting a really solid quality team that runs a great business today and through some additional tools that we can provide around our operating system i think can certainly leverage those tools to their full potential andrew m casey  wells fargo securities llc great thanks scott and then last one back on welding your comments about that being one of the businesses that stabilized during at least the second half of last year did you see any difference in trends through the year between capex and consumables and then also did you see any change within the second half in some of your bigger customers maybe machinery oem behavior versus if you will the general distributor base michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah no so we didnt really see anything other than what i described earlier right and so on the equipment side certainly down a little bit more than the consumables that have been fairly stable throughout the year but no significant changes as weve gone through the year or the fourth quarter andrew m casey  wells fargo securities llc okay thanks a lot michael operator thank you our next question will be coming from the line of nicole deblase of morgan stanley nicole deblase  morgan stanley  co llc yeah thanks good morning ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director good morning sorry about the last name there nicole deblase  morgan stanley  co llc its okay im used to it its deblase so the first question is on construction so the north america construction products core growth i think it decelerated a bit to  this quarter it was more like  in q im just curious on the drivers is it a comp issue are you seeing some slowdown in north america construction on an underlying basis and then i guess what are your thoughts on the north america nonresi construction side goal into  michael m larsen  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah so if you look at the fourth quarter up  organic like i said residential was flat which was slightly better than expected on the renovation remodel channel thats really where the growth up  for the fullyear and then commercial down slightly those trends weve been kind of bumping along those same numbers in  we feel good about  and we would expect that business to grow in  at a rate similar to what we saw in  which was up  organically nicole deblase  morgan stanley  co llc okay got it thats helpful and then for my followup just looking at the tmelectronics business it was pretty strong this quarter stronger than we had expected and i would say that the margin performance there was a bit of a standout so is that just enterprise initiatives or is there anything else to highlight from a margin perspective and do you also think that tmelectronics can show positive margin progression in  ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director yeah absolutely i mean we think well continue to make progress on operating margin in test  measurement and in the fourth quarter really nothing unusual other than what weve been talking about for almost three years now in terms of really strong execution of the enterprise initiatives including  in that business so very sustainable more progress to come in  and  nicole deblase  morgan stanley  co llc okay great thanks ill pass it on operator thank you our next question will be coming from the line of jamie cook of credit suisse jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi good morning just two quick followups one again the comments you made about the sequential improvements in some of your industrial businesses was interesting can you comment on if that trend continued into january and then i guess the second question is given the incremental lagdown weve seen in oil prices what have you sort of baked into your guidance in  in terms of risk because you could see a lag effect there thanks ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director yeah so like we said earlier no change in the month of january were on track to the guidance for the quarter oil and gas demand while certainly down yearoveryear has remained stable and like we said earlier the primary impact there is on the welding side and we expect that business to decline in the singledigits in  jamie l cook  credit suisse securities usa llc broker all righty thanks operator thank you our next question will be coming from the line of ann duignan from jpmorgan ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc well it would be helpful if they could get my first name right morning just following up on the acquisition of zf as they would call it in europe how did that deal come about for decades companies have been trying to get out of automotive supply and it hasnt been deemed as a very attractive sector to be in im curious was this an auction process zf was trying to get rid of this business or did itw approach zf im just curious how it all happened ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director well im not sure that its probably our place to comment on that i think were – its a business that weve known about for a long time ill put it that way ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc okay so youre not willing to comment on whether it was an auction ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director you can ask them ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc okay no problem and maybe you could just talk about the backlog then on the acquisition front what are you seeing out there in terms of buyers versus sellers are we still looking at high expectations from sellers ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director well my answer is we remain very much a niche player on the acquisition space as weve talked about our primary thrust remains on focus on making this pivot organic so im not sure were your best barometer in terms of pipeline we have a few segments that are in the readytogrow mode largely who are now enabled to start to think about what might be complementary to what theyre doing but i would say from a standpoint of our overall level of effort here we wouldnt be a good barometer in terms of whats going on in the overall market ann p duignan  jpmorgan securities llc okay ill leave it there in the interest of time thank you operator thank you our next question will be coming from the line of steve fisher of ubs steven michael fisher  ubs securities llc great thanks just two regional outlook questions on europe were seeing some mixed data points what are you seeing and expecting for your overall business in aggregate in europe in  and then similarly with china obviously roughly flat in the fourth quarter but you had some big moving pieces with automotive quite a bit something else was down how do you see china going forward in  overall ernest scott santi  chairman chief executive officer  director yeah so i think steve kind of big picture here i mean europe was up a little more than  in  we expect that to stay at the current run rate to be – in that range maybe a little better than that driven again by strong presence in automotive growing doubledigits or a big quarter in  and more to come there food equipment should have another really good year in that region so more of the same maybe a little bit better in europe based on current run rates china was flat essentially in the quarter flat for the year and we expect a similar environment going into  steven michael fisher  ubs securities llc okay thank you aaron h hoffman  vice presidentinvestor
