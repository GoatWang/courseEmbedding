and  “most trustworthy companies in america” mendelson has served as heico’s copresident since  and is also president of the company’s electronic technologies group whose net sales increased  percent to a record  million in the second quarter of fiscal  “our products are found on large commercial aircraft regional business and military aircraft as well as on a large variety of industrial turbines targeting systems missiles and electrooptical devices” he said sharing a dream born in new york mendelson was  months old when his parents laurans and arlene moved to miami he graduated from gulliver school and then returned to new york city as a freshman at columbia college earning his bachelor’s degree in political science in  his older brother eric was already a student at columbia on his way to a bachelor’s degree in economics and an mba the brothers had already formed an investment company and mendelson was considering a law degree in preparation for a career in finance “with our father we shared a dream of taking over a troubled public company and making it a success” mendelson said “since eric and i were in new york we were able to talk with several wall street securities analysts one of them suggested we look at heico which was a small florida company that was losing money” the three mendelsons acquired enough shares to become the largest shareholders but had to initiate a proxy fight for control of the company “during my senior year at columbia we sued the directors for proxy solicitation violations and the case came to trial during my first semester at um law school” mendelson said “by the end of the trial it was apparent that we would win so the company turned over management to us on january  ” victor h mendelson a new chapter at that time heico had about  million in annual sales with a market cap of about  million one of the first things the mendelsons did was to allocate about  percent of the company stock—priced at less than  share—to the employees’ k defined contribution plan since then the value of those shares has grown exponentially as mendelson said “we are proud to have rewarded our company’s loyal employees turning many of them into millionaires” in the early s mendelson was living at home juggling his law school assignments with the responsibilities of building a business “we have a close family and the company is intertwined in our lives” he said but mendelson also paid close attention to his classes particularly the corporate and security law courses taught by professor stephen halpert after he graduated he returned to the law school several times as a guest lecturer on his experience at heico for mendelson one of the primary benefits of a law school education was being able to serve as the general counsel as well as an operational executive on heico’s lean management team “every contract over a minimal size and every important negotiation came across my desk” he said “i was responsible for closing most of the  acquisitions we’ve made since  working with the entrepreneurs who were selling their companies my legal background helped me navigate those deals and i was able to overlay my business judgment on top of that” secrets of a turnaround turning around heico was a longterm process—not like waving a magic wand “we were able to do so by running a good business taking care of our people and developing products our customers needed” mendelson said one of the first and most serious challenges the mendelsons faced was a lawsuit from utc dating back to the s “they filed an injunction to prevent us from making a jet engine replacement part—our only product at the time—and sued for  million in damages” he said “fortunately our insurance company covered the legal fees and our attorneys were successful in defending our company after ten years in the courts the utc lawsuit was dismissed” meanwhile the mendelsons began broadening heico’s product line beginning with aircraft replacement parts and moving into electronic components “i founded our electronic technologies group in  as we began acquiring aerospace and defense electronics firms” he said “we now develop missioncritical highreliability components for a variety of applications our latest products include chips for laser range finders that help determine the distance from a target as well as infrared testing and calibration equipment for aircraft cameras and detection systems” mendelson said “these are all critical components in advanced technology products”  building on success through the years heico has allowed most of its acquisitions to run as standalone businesses within the corporate framework “we are buying successful niche businesses where the founders and owners have knowledge and expertise” mendelson said “we are not looking to squeeze more juice from the same orange instead we want to encourage their creativity and ability to respond to the market so they can continue their success as a result about  percent of those entrepreneurs are still with us” on the personal side mendelson and his wife lisa have three children including two daughters at columbia university where he now serves as chairman of the columbia college board of visitors active in a number of community organizations including serving as treasurer of the boys  girls clubs of miamidade trustee of st thomas university and board member of florida grand opera mendelson said “lisa and i love the south florida lifestyle we couldn’t imagine living anywhere else” tags news alumni miami law magazine quicklinks media
