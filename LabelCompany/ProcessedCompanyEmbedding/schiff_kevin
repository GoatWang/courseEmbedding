associates co lpa two columbus lawyers well versed in television advertising are suing a firm allegedly using their names without permission in online marketing personal injury attorneys scott schiff and kevin kurgis have teamed up in a lawsuit against exclusive legal marketing inc alleging the texas company purchased their names as google search terms so its own website would be prominently placed in search results for the two highprofile lawyers enlarge scott schiff attorney schiff  associates co lpa schiff and kurgis allege exclusive legal marketing is scooping up visitors searching for them then sending the leads to their competitors with those potential clients led to believe theyre speaking with someone associated with schiff or kurgis “kevin and i have been competitors for  years but we both try to do the right thing always” schiff told me “we’re not going to tolerate unscrupulous and fraudulent attempts to defraud the public into hiring the wrong lawyers” the lawsuit against exclusive legal marketing and founder coety bryant filed in the us district court for the southern district of ohio alleges trademark infringement unfair competition and deceptive trade practices among other charges “they certainly have never hired these guys” said attorney joe dreitler of columbus’ dreitler true llc which is representing schiff and kurgis in the lawsuit schiff and kurgis each have trademark registrations for their names and have built up their brands with years of tv ads you can see schiff in action at his youtube channel and here is a collection of classic kurgis ads a recent google search for “kevin kurgis” first turned up an advertisement for exclusive legal marketing’s personalinjurycarenet followed by a search result linking to kevinkurgiscom searching “scott schiff” also yielded the personalinjurycarenet ad as the top result followed by an ad for schiff’s services although one not placed through exclusive legal marketing and then the link to scottschiffcom neither defendants not their client law firms have been licensed or authorized by plaintiffs to use their names for any commercial purpose including as a keyword schiff and kurgis said in their complaint schiff and kurgis are seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction compensatory damages treble damages disgorgement of profits and costs and attorneys’ fees they cite damage to their businesses goodwill reputations profits and the strength of their trademarks a letter from dreitler true requests exclusive legal marketing cease using the schiff and kurgis names by wednesday it also requests information about the extent of business the company generated by using the search engine keywords a representative for plano texasbased exclusive legal marketing said in an email the complaint is “not even what you all think it is” but declined to comment further kurgis who could not be reached for comment has been operating his law office for more than  years schiff
