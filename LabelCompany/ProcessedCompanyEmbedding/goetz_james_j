alto networks quantenna ruckus wireless whatsapp all of us look up to these legendary founders but every one of them started out as an unknown underdog this was true for the founders of whatsapp carbon nimble storage admob and palo alto networks and its true for the seedstage founder who walks in our door tomorrow i loved the years i had as an entrepreneur today i’m most interested in mobile and the postpc transition and in disrupting the enterprise it stack what’s really interesting to us is new categories where there is no market theres no tam theres no sam and its all about those early beachhead customers the common thread through sequoia’s most legendary founders misfits unknowns all focused on personal pain all willing to put something out early and iterate reinventing the it stack is the hereandnow opportunity so whether its storage or compute or software architectures the postpc delivery methodology — theyre all going to shift enterprise startups — they have one competitor typically maybe two and those are the incumbents they’re large slow flatfooted so its almost blueocean compare that to consumer the categories that are interesting often have a couple dozen companies and they’re wellfunded it borders on the malthusian i was raised in the midwest studied as an engineer and gave up on a phd to start my career as a rookie product manager how are you going to build longterm competitive barriers we’re not comforted by patents i can tell you that patents are fine but its more of a defensive tactic if you’re an engineer and i was guilty of this you love talking about technology but as an investor it’s more about understanding how that technology or business process creates an unfair advantage its very easy to convince yourself that an idea is unique and compelling if youre not intellectually honest probably one in  entrepreneurs who walks through our doors can really convey their initial marketing position in under five minutes if you can get to that stage boy are we interested we get tingly when we meet with a bunch of engineers who just knocked out some fabulous code they may not talk a lot in the meeting but that lends a great deal of credibility you see these stacked founding teams and — where are the timesten programmers where’s that wonderful architect where’s that individual with the fabulous sense of simplicity and market expertise pedigree is not important at sequoia it’s not part of our criteria it’s that team dynamic the cadence of the weekly the monthly the quarterly successes competing in the marketplace taking
