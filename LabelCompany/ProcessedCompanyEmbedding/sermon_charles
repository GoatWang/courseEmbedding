for his plainspokenness his courage his enthusiasm for the word of god his love for the truth his command of the english language and his ability to use simple vivid language to make difficult truths inescapably clear though in a widely different vein the volume is in every way worthy of the author of john ploughmans talk the varied phrases of farming life to which reference is made in the sacred word are turned into excellent accounts in conveying deep and important spiritual lessons in a word these sermons are as fresh and fragrant as the newlyploughed soil or the newmown hay and ought to be perused with pleasure and profit by many who know little or nothing of agricultural pursuits one day i heard a friend say i write my sermons then i read spurgeon to see how he dealt with the text the

spurgeon in these days for help and i have not been disappointed my purpose in this article is to show how spurgeons life and ministry can encourage pastors to keep on preaching through adversity ive always loved charles spurgeon for his plainspokenness his courage his enthusiasm for the word of god his love for the truth his command of the english language and his ability to use simple vivid language to make difficult truths inescapably clear never have i read anywhere or in any literature anything that compares to the sermons of c h spurgeon constitute a complete body of systematic theology i have read everything by spurgeon i can get my hands on translated as mr spurgeon sermons have been into nearly all of the languages of the world their popularity at home is a fact that admits no dispute and needs no enforcement the language is as homely as pungent and as felicitous in its appeal to the understanding of the people as ever it was the subjects of many texts are handled by him in a manner that shows his complete mastery of the highest rhetorical art of exposition charles haddon spurgeon whose name is a household word the world over is the most remarkable minister of christ now living mr spurgeon was absolutely destitute of intellectual benevolence if men saw as he did they were orthodox if they saw things in some other way they were heterodox pestilent and unfit to lead the minds of students or inquirers mr spurgeons was a superlative egotism not the shillyshallying timid halfdisguised egotism that cuts off its own head but the fullgrown overpowering sublime egotism that takes the chief seat as if by right the only colors which mr spurgeon recognized were black and white there was no one who could preach like my father in inexhaustible variety witty wisdom vigorous proclamation loving entreaty and lucid teaching with a multitude of other qualities he must at least in my opinion ever be regarded as the prince of preachers one day i heard a friend say i write my sermons then i read spurgeon to see how he dealt with the text the prince of preachers is still head of the class amazoncom kindle ebooks kindle store literature  fiction foreign

metropolitan tabernacle pulpit sermons and expositions from genesis  to revelation  back to top praise for the print edition i have turned to charles spurgeon in these days for help and i have not been disappointed    i think the word indefatigable was created for people like charles spurgeon —john piper    the greatest bible preacher outside of scripture —mark driscoll with whom among men can you compare spurgeon he combined the preaching power of jonathan edwards and whitefield with the organizing power of wesley and the energy fire and courage of luther —b h carroll some of earths great ones have no doubt sunk into oblivion but among those whom history remembers only those are great whom history greatens spurgeon is among that number —w y fullerton there was no voice in the victorian pulpit as resonant no preacher as beloved by the people no orator as prodigious as charles haddon spurgeon —hughes oliphant old spurgeon combined oratorical prowess and evangelistic fervor with a deep concern for social issues     despite both his fame and his largerthanlife talent spurgeon retained a sense of reverence for the responsibility and act of preaching —richard lischer charles haddon spurgeon is one of evangelical christianity’s immortals —carl fh henry mr spurgeon laid his foundation in the bible his utterances abound with scriptural text figure metaphor and allusion whatever he says sends his hearers to the sacred record but starting from this basis he has added to it a stock of reading such as few men can show in their talk or in their writing he cannot be accused of not being a man of the world or of not knowing the ways of the world for he reads the book and the book of nature too his style is illustrated with almost pictorial brightness —the times as sermons they stand alone unequalled by any other published sermons by men now in the pulpit or by those of other generations —the standard each setence is a cluster of diamonds some rough but all of them real each discourse has the genuine gospel ring that proves it to have been coined in the mint of heaven —the christian london the paul of his time —the missionary review the impression i shall carry with me to my dying day was that of a man who had found life made real noble joyous by his living faith in a living christ and who longed to impart to others the life which christ had imparted to him —lyman abbot outlook translated as mr spurgeons sermons have been into nearly all the languages of the world their popularity at home is a fact that admits no dispute and needs no enforcement the subjects of many texts are handled by him in a manner that shows his complete mastery of the highest rhetorical art of exposition —the daily telegraph back to top product details title the complete spurgeon

have been pulled out and put into a sort of virtual commentary by the master preacher covering much but not all of the bible his new testament writings are particularly rich and comprise a large body of work his comments are very extensive on new testament books he often preached from such as romans an example from romans   romans  so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ many other people were ashamed of the gospel of christ it was too simple it had not enough of mystery about it it had not enough of worldly wisdom about it paul says “i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ” and then gives his reason for not being ashamed of it biblesoft’s unique study platform allows you not only to read and
