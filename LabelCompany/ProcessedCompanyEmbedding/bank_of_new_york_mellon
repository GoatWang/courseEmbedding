turn the call over to gerald hassell gerald gerald hassell thanks valerie and thank you for joining us this morning as you may have seen from our release we again delivered doubledigit earnings per share growth for the quarter we earned  per share up  yearoveryear which includes a  per share tax benefit related to new accounting guidance for stock awards and looking at our results on an adjusted basis total revenue grew by  driven by  growth in investment services fees and  growth in investment management and performance fees and  growth in net interest revenue total noninterest expense was up  resulting in nearly  basis points of positive operating leverage our pretax operating margin increased to  and we are continuing to deliver high returns on tangible common equity this quarter achieving a very healthy return of  and since we shared our threeyear strategic plan with you on october of  we have delivered nine straight quarters of solid performance against the eps calls that we laid out for ourselves the relative consistency of our results reflects how well our dynamic welldiversified lowrisk business model is positioned to create increased value for clients and shareholders through all environments so now let me update you on our progress against our strategic priorities during the quarter our top priority is enhancing the client experience and driving profitable revenue growth in investment services weve been investing in cuttingedge collateral optimization and management solutions that we delivered to both the buyside and the sellside during the quarter collateral balances continued to show robust growth which speaks to the strong level of client uptake that we have experienced another area of investment has involved building bestinclass technology and middleoffice services that enable asset managers to leverage our scale and expertise now you may recall that back at our investor day we discussed the market opportunity to service alternatives including real estate assets yesterday we announced that pgim real estate the real estate business of prudential financial one of the top  real estate investment managers in the us selected us to provide fund administrative services for  billion in us real estate assets and these assets are not included in our assets under custody and assets in our administration win for the first quarter but they will be included in the second quarter this mandate is a clear endorsement that our investment in the alternatives space are paying off we were also recently selected by aia group the largest independent publicly listed panasian life insurance group to provide investment book of records software and to consolidate all of our investment management data on to a single platform and were seeing a demand for investment books of records solutions as global investment returns firms seek to replace legacy platforms to manage investment risk improve decisionmaking and ensure consistency in reporting our bestinclass eagle data management platform is well positioned to meet that demand and given its flexibility and our ability and to scale to support growth now for the quarter we had  billion in estimated new auc assets under administration and business wins which ill remind you excludes the impact of the prudential transaction so were off to a good start in  and we remain encouraged by the strength of our new business pipeline in investment management we had a good quarter with revenue up  and pretax income excluding intangibles up  our adjusted pretax operating margins rose to  helped by increased revenues and various expense actions overall asset management flows improved to their highest level in several years of note our cash business  above ph the industry trend of outflows and in the quarter we added  billion in assets inflows now looking at our investment performance over the longer term we continue to see strong performance with twothirds of our actively managed mutual fund assets ranked ahead of their peer median on a three and a fiveyear basis within the business we are continuing to revitalize our investment product portfolio to meet evolving client demand so for example some of the greatest growth opportunities in active management lie in multiasset class alternative and specialist active equity strategies as a result we are working to increase our product offering in these areas and weve also been investing to develop additional capabilities in credit real return equity income and liabilitydriven investment across all of our businesses we continue to focus on enhancing the client experience which we have no doubt will drive future revenue growth we have a high tech and a high touch approach to servicing our clients investing in the digital experience and adopting a common discipline and approach that further improves how we interact with our clients our second priority is executing on our business improvement process to create efficiency and quality benefits for our clients and reduce technology and operations and structural costs for ourselves now during the quarter we continue to increase our use of robotic and cognitive technologies to drive efficiencies and productivity we have increased the number of bots in production from about  bots at yearend to over  at the end of the first quarter and this speaks to the success of our early efforts on this front those bots are automating certain task which is improving accuracy and decreasing processing time by as much as  to  depending upon the function and we further downsized our real estate portfolio during the quarter exiting three locations for a reduction of  rentable square feet now in a yearoveryear basis we have exited  locations and  rentable square feet and you can see the impact of these actions in our lower net occupancy costs now we also continue to align client pricing when increasing regulatory and service costs for example we imposed new fees to compensate for cost related to the investor tax reporting that we provide to european offshore funding counting clients when we formalized our business improvement process a few years ago many wanted to know how long it could continue to generate savings we still have a solid pipeline of opportunities to expand automation further rationalize our real estate footprint and reduce vendor cost which will help us to further reduce costs and improve our operating margin now our third priority centers on being a strong safe trusted counterparty during the quarter we upgraded and streamlined risk reporting and making the enterprise much more resilient and we continue to expand the global footprint of our risk and compliance organization to gain access to top qualitative and quantitative talent capabilities outside of the us our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet including strong capital and liquidity positions while returning significant value to our shareholders from a regulatory ratio standpoint our fully phasedin slr is now at  which is a healthy buffer to the regulatory minimum especially considering our low credit risk business model during the quarter we returned nearly  billion in value to our shareholders repurchasing  million in

services powerhouse its exciting to envision the potential opportunities for our clients and our shareholders so with that let me turn it over to todd thomas gibbons thanks gerald and good morning everyone in the first quarter we performed well as our strategy is strengthening our franchise benefiting our clients and improving our financial performance when you look at the results for the yearoveryear quarter i think a few things stand out first we experienced solid revenue growth in investment services fees and investment management and performance fees both were up  second while our net interest revenue and our net interest margin benefited from the rate increases both results were a little lighter than we anticipated due to the slightly smaller balance sheet now the dynamics of that ill discuss later in a little more detail i will also provide with you some additional color on how additional rate increases are expected to benefit both nir and the nim and finally we generated positive operating leverage and increased our operating margins from both higher revenue and continued expense control despite the significant pressures that we felt on regulatory costs turning to our financial highlights document ill continue my commentary starting on slide  and that gives you an overview of our operating results for the quarter our first quarter eps was  thats  higher than the yearago quarter on an adjusted basis yearoveryear looking at our performance on an adjusted basis first quarter revenue was up  expenses were up  and we generated approximately  basis points of operating leverage as weve noted in prior quarters the strength of the dollar continues to impact our results its negative for revenues and positive for expenses however the net impact from currency translation was once again minimal to our consolidated pretax income income before income taxes was up  our adjusted pretax operating margin was up two percentage points to  and return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was  for the quarter compared to about  in the yearago quarter now moving ahead to slide  i will discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue total investment services fees were up  asset servicing fees were up  yearoveryear and they were flat sequentially the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects net new business and that includes the growth of our collateral optimization solutions as well as higher equity values and its partially offset by the impact of the us dollar as well as the negative impact of downsizing of the uk retail transfer agency business yearoveryear the impact of these latter two items was approximately minus  to our revenue growth rate clearing services fees increased  yearoveryear and  sequentially primarily driven by higher money market and mutual fund fees issuer ph service fees were up  yearoveryear reflecting higher depository receipt fees and that was partially offset by lower fees in corporate trust treasury services fees increased to  yearoveryear reflecting higher payment volumes partially offset by higher compensating balance credits provided to clients and that reduced fee revenue although it did increase net interest revenue a bit first quarter investment management and performance fees increased  yearoveryear thats primarily acting higher market values and is partially offset by the impact of a stronger us dollar principally against the british pound as well as the impact of last years asset outflows on a constantcurrency basis investment management and performance fees actually increased  weve been focused on delivering profitable revenue growth within investment management through our business improvement process which reduces expenses and drives future growth in line with our objectives adjusted net operating margins improved to  for the quarter driven by higher revenues and expense improvement actions taken over the course over the last year turning to foreign exchange and other revenue fx and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was  lower yearoveryear and it was up  sequentially fx revenue of  million was  lower yearoveryear and  lower sequentially the yearoveryear and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower market volatility the migration to lowermargin products also impacted the yearoveryear comparison but not so much the sequential comparison investment and other income of  million compared with  million in the year ago quarter and  million in the fourth quarter both comparisons primarily reflect the net gain related to an equity investment and decreases in other income from our increased investments and renewable energy the yearoveryear decrease also reflects lower leaserelated gains the sequential increase was partially offset by lower income from corporate bankowned life insurance now slide  shows the drivers of our investment management business that help explain our underlying performance assets under management of  trillion was up  yearoveryear reflecting higher market values offset by the impact of the dollar primarily versus the british pound with regards to flows with net inflows of  billion we had the best quarter in years while active equity strategies continue to experience outflows the revenue impact was more than offset by inflows of  billion into other active strategies this includes  billion into liabilitydriven investments and  billion into multiasset and alternative investments as we maintain our focus on improving the revenue mix toward longterm highvalue active solutions with regard to shortterm flows as gerald noted we added  billion in cash and we did that by focusing both on the performance as well as increasing distribution through our liquidity portals this was in contrast to the cash industry which experienced overall outflows now turning to our investment services metrics on slide  assets under custody and administration at quarter end were a record  trillion thats up  yearoveryear and reflects higher market values offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger dollar linkedquarter auca was up  mainly driven by improved market values and a slightly weaker dollar we estimate total new assets under custody and our administration business wins were  billion in the first quarter looking at the other key investment services metrics youll see average deposits declined  yearoveryear and  sequentially reflecting both the impact of the rate increase as well as our efforts to proactively manage our balance sheet to meet the liquidity and capital requirements lastly triparty repo balances grew a healthy  turning to net interest revenue on slide  youll see that on a fully taxequivalent basis nir was up  to  million versus the yearago quarter the yearoveryear increase in nir primarily reflects higher rates and the impact of interest rate hedging activities and those actually negatively impacted the first quarter of  less than the first quarter of  and that was partially offset by lower average earning assets as well as higher average longterm debt the sequential decrease primarily reflects the impact of interest rate hedging activities in the fourth quarter of  premium amortization adjustment which combined reduced net interest revenue by approximately  million sequentially and thats about  basis points impact to the net interest margin substantially all of the interestrate hedging activities and for fourth quarter were offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue now nir benefited from higher rates which was partially offset by a reduced balance sheet and weve discussed that previously how we intended to do that as well as some adjustment to the asset and liability mix to build a cushion for the fully phasedin liquidity coverage ratio that went into effect in the first quarter as we look forward to the second quarter and the full year using the forward yield curve to estimate we would expect to see nir rise  in the second quarter  excuse me  to  in the second quarter and  to  for the full year as the balance sheet stays flat or contract slightly turning to slide  youll see that our adjusted noninterest expense on a yearoveryear and sequential basis increased  the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects higher consulting and staff expenses partially offset by lower other expense the increase in consulting expense primarily reflects higher regulatory and compliance cost related to resolution planning and ccar after we submit the resolution plan on july  the quarterly run rate for these expenses should come down by approximately  million the increase in staff expense primarily reflects higher incentive expense that was partially offset by the favorable impact of a stronger dollar as you will see we added a separate line item for our bank assessment charges to provide additional transparencies indiscernible and are expected to remain a significant cost item the sequential increase in noninterest expense primarily reflects higher staff expense and that was offset by lower business development net occupancy software and equipment as well as professional legal and other purchase services the increase in staff expense reflects divesting of longterm stock awards for retirementeligible employees partially offset by lower severance expense in the first quarter consistent with prior quarters the first quarter reflects the benefit of improved efficiencies as well as savings from our location strategy which is designed to optimize our footprint as well as from our vendor renegotiations that continue to reduce our cost savings from efforts like these are enabling us to fund important growth initiatives including nexen as well as to absorb increased cost related to the regulatory requirements turning to capital on slide  all of our fully phasedin ratios increased during the quarter our fully phasedin supplemental leverage ratio increased to  as we both generated capital and reduced average assets one of the benefits of our decreased balance sheet as we now have a reasonably  reasonable buffer above the slr minimum that will provide additional flexibility in managing our capital going forward we also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio a few additional notes about the quarter our effective tax rate of  was reduced by approximately  or  per common share from the application of the new accounting guidance related to the annual vesting of stock awards this results in a benefit this quarter due to our stock appreciation above the awards original grant price now page  of our press release we show investment security portfolio highlights at quarter end our net unrealized pretax loss from the portfolio was  million and that compares with  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  and that improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in market interest rates now let me share a few thoughts on our outlook on topics that have been top of mind with investors since the change in the new administration we believe that many of the post crisis regulations have made us and the banking industry stronger although some modest adjustments could be helpful to our business model it is really too early to predict outcomes so at this point were maintaining our current regulatory compliance initiatives and the significant corresponding spend associated with them however during federal reserve governors departing speech he suggested adjusting the enhanced slr requirement for risk and that should provide some relief for the custody banks now let me provide you with some color on how were thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you with our modeling as we look forward in the event of future rate increases we expect flat to modest contraction of our balance sheet which we also expect to be more than offset by a higher net interest margin we expect net interest revenue to increase approximately  to  sequentially and approximately  to  for the full year we also expect our net interest margin to expand to   somewhere between  and  basis points by the end of the year which should continue to expand in coming years as we reinvest maturing securities on our portfolio regarding fee waivers we have recovered nearly all of the pretax income related to the interest rate sensitive fee waivers we also expect our regulatory and compliance cost to continue to be elevated in the second quarter reflecting the increased expenses associated primarily with the resolution of recovery plan but with ccar as well as mentioned earlier we expect these expenses to decrease over the second half of the year by approximately  million per quarter despite the increased regulatory cost we expect our total expenses to remain close to flat to last years level in the second quarter for the full year we expect our total adjusted expenses to be up no more than  regarding taxes we expect our  effective tax rate to be in the range of  to  as we have previously guided and finally we expect to generate positive operating leverage once again in  with that let me hand it over to gerald gerald hassell before we open the line for our questions let me offer a couple of more thoughts as a reminder this is our ninth consecutive quarter of solid performance against our eps goals i also want to remind you that we have a welldiversified lower risk business model that is largely feebased with recurring fees representing nearly  of our revenues now that positions us to consistently deliver solid quarterly results and higher riskadjusted returns versus other financial institutions and were executing our strategic priorities to deliver even greater value for our clients and our shareholders with that operator we can now open it up for some questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies kenneth usdin thanks a lot guys good morning todd i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the balance sheet and specifically your point about reinvesting cash flows off the securities book in terms of where the curve has moved to and then just separately how do we just think about given that youre not a traditional bank how do we think about the deposit data and how you expect your balance sheet to act differently if at all from more of traditional to regional thomas gibbons sure ken good morning i think as weve guided in the past we do see some sensitivities to interest rates to the balance sheet in fact it moved pretty much  the deposit base has moved pretty much along the lines that we had anticipated so we saw in the quarter on average deposits down about  billion that has  since actually gone up a little bit but it feels like it should be fairly steady there the betas themselves are pretty low so if you  as you see from our disclosures in the quarter our interest rate paid on deposits moved from a negative  to  basis points positive so about  basis points with the  basis point move remember not all of this is dollar denominated but  of it is so far that move you could kind of look at the beta somewhere between the  and  range we would expect those betas to creep up as interest rates continue to go up so what we would expect to see is a little bit of contraction in the balance sheet and a little bit of expansion in the net interest margin and thats why we think we can continue to see the growth that were talking about in nir so not a whole lot further contraction in the balance sheet is what we currently expect kenneth usdin all right and as my followup ill just ask the first part just keep it that just again your reinvestments  you know in terms of the long end has come in quite sharply are you able to find new securities to replace that rolloff still at higher levels just  can you talk through on front book back book and just kind of reinvestment yields thomas gibbons yes that is obviously a little bit disappointing that the yield curve has remained so flat it was not when you do modeling you typically do it assuming a parallel curve although when were doing our forecasting we are forecasting and off of a forward rate curve so the assumptions that were making here is that the market will follow the forward rate curve and obviously the forward rate curve for longer term rates has come down with the rally in the markets over the past months or so so the answer to the question is we would expect off of that forward rate curve to see first of all a substantial amount of those securities portfolio are floating so clearly they are going to reset with the libor resets and the remainder is repricing a substantial amount as repricing each year and we would  given those two factors we would expect to grind the yield up in that securities portfolio overtime in the rate environment kenneth usdin got it thanks operator our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein thanks guys just the first question in the  around the servicing business it definitely feels like the competitive dynamics have gotten a little tougher jp morgan announced that youve gone a little bit more aggressive in that business in the last couple of quarters so maybe you could talk about your relative position in the space there today i guess how do you defend your position and perhaps the areas where you feel most  the biggest opportunity for yourself to grow both from a revenue perspective but also from a profitability perspective brian shea so this is brian shea im happy to take that we feel pretty good about the outlook for the investment services businesses youre seeing the investment services fee revenue growth up  which is actually improved over what has been a yearoveryear more recently and we think the asset servicing business which is going to benefit from secular trends which are putting pressure on asset managers to transform their operating models and to outsource more of their solutions so thats why we see growth opportunities in the middle office space we see growth opportunities from technology solutions eagle that gerald mentioned is a great example of that and we see growth in the alternative space the announcement of the pjm real estate outsourcing opportunity is a great example because most of the market is still insources their real estate to fund administration and this is a big growth opportunity for us so we see  and we see growth opportunities in the eps administration space and were investing in all those areas so we feel good about the longterm prospects in the asset servicing business the clearing business is also performing pretty well and were benefiting from the fact that selfclearing firms are reconsidering whether they want to clear for themselves and pershing has a solid pipeline as a result of that were getting good growth in the ra custody business which is benefiting from the department of labor fiduciary standard were getting some mutual fund consolidation drive into the platform again driven by the dol change where people are moving mutual funds to platform so they can put them under an advisory framework and so we  and we still see some  and were getting real leverage between pershing and the private bank we have record levels now of both  credit facilities established between the wealth management bank and pershing clients and record levels of outstanding credit now over  billion in loans provided to those introducing brokerdealers and rias the issue of service business is solid we have solid share in the markets were in obviously we benefit from a higher  their issuance environment corporate trust is in the first quarter the yearoveryear comparison is the issuance of global debt is down something like  but our share of the market is pretty steady and were positioned to grow as the issuance market picks up and were getting good traction in the corporate and insurance space in particular and of course were a leader in the brokerdealer clearing space us government securities and triparty repo market and weve invested heavily in resiliency resolvability scalability of that business so that we can serve the market well and responsibly and we expect that business  that will start to grow in the second half of this year and throughout the course of  so overall there are competitive pressures but honestly were really focused on what the clients need in this market and what the clients solutions we can use to differentiate ourselves so we feel pretty good about the prospects alexander blostein thanks and i guess a followup along similar lines which is on collateral management specifically gerald you highlighted that in the release and your prepared remarks that thats been a pretty exciting area of growth for you guys is it possible at all to kind of break out what the revenue contribution is overall for the firm now from a collateral management and maybe just give us a sense on what the growth in that area has been gerald hassell well we break out a lot of detail already alex breaking out a particular individual line item is just too complicated considering its both for the buyside as well as the sellside it goes across asset servicing and our markets business and so to segregate it and to call it out individually would be pretty tough that being said it is an increasingly and in demand set of solutions and so it was initially around collateral management and then it became segregation issues around the new regulatory environments down the world now were shifting into collateral optimization and building the engines for that on a global basis so we still feel very positive about its growth trajectory on a global basis for both the buyside and the sell side alexander blostein got it all right taking a try all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr hello a question on the whole slr and central bank deposits including the leverage ratio not asking you to speculate of what will happen i think it should happen its happened in the uk my question is if it were to happen what would you do to the money ph its a decent size chunk of your balance sheet how does that get reallocated what kind of benefit could that be if it happen thomas gibbons glen its todd ill take this i think there are actually two if any release comes on the slr i think theres two approaches to it one is that they would change the denominator a bit just as you described maybe they would exclude from that riskless securities such as treasuries or central bank deposits the alternative is to adjust the enhanced slr to the additional  basis points similarly the way they do to the gsib ph buffers that are required on the riskweighted ratios and that is what governor trilo ph recommended specifically in his departing speech and we would assume that perhaps given where we are on a gsib ph buffer relative to others that might be about half so that just kind of paints the picture for possible future rule changes all that being said we still have  i dont think you would see a dramatic change necessarily in how we have to manage capital because the ccar would still be constrained by the leverage ratio the traditional leverage ratio itself so we would need to take that into consideration it would make it easier for us to meet our spot ratios were one of the few institutions that tends to more constrained by spot but thats really no longer the case with where our capital is today so now were in a pretty good position it would probably put us in a position to take on certain types of lowrisk activities that we wouldnt have otherwise taken i mean it would increase the deposits activities there are certain lending types of activities that might be a little more attractive to us than they would have been so i think number one it is a possibility that we could expand into certain activities and manage our capital a little bit tighter the other potential outcome is if there is a reduction for example around treasures and central bank deposits we would expect that to promote more activity in the repo markets in other markets that we serve so that  that could potentially be a positive to the fee generation of the company gerald hassell glenn if i could just add  you know on the supplemental leverage or enhanced supplemental leverage its actually very nice to see governor trilo ph in his final speech specifically call it out related to the custody banks if we see some movement im a little bit optimistic we will it will allow us to have a more flexibility with their balance sheet as you know over the course of the last year we pushed deposits out which is counterintuitive to what a bank is supposed to do and so i think by some relaxation of that that will give us more flexibility on the balance sheet and whether its repos or repo financing or accepting customer deposits and putting those deposits to work which can create more income and it could just give us more flexibility in the future glenn schorr i think i appreciate all those comments but quickly followup on that regulatory theme is you were kind of clear in terms of what we should expect costwise i just want to revisit how come regulatory costs are higher right now there is this overall feeling like theyve plateaued and trending better in general what specifically is taking up some of the dollars being used right now thomas gibbons so for us glenn its really the resolution plan so we  as you know weve got feedback on the resolution plan last year we responded to the deficiencies in october we got positive feedback on the deficiencies but there were other options that we needed to deliver by july  we have a significant number of people i mean a very significant number of people focused on delivering this resolution plan that comes with quite a few investments we had said in the past that the investments associated with that probably had between the capital and other spend of over  million we are in the highest burn rate point right now up to the delivery of it on july  and then we would expect to see a little bit of relief thereafter of course well then be waiting for feedback and im sure well continue to evolve and improve the plan over the next few years but i think weve made great progress and it has come in at a significant cost glenn schorr got it thank you for your answers i appreciate it operator our next line comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell great thanks very much maybe just todd if we could just go back to the net interest revenue and if you could talk a little bit about the hedging activities in the first quarter and sort of the thought for coming into the next quarter i think there was less of an offset in fees this quarter if you could talk about that dynamic moving into the second quarter and whether you think that will push us through the year ph thomas gibbons sure brian so there are basically two types of hedging that goes on so if you look at our longterm debt most of that debt we have to swapped to floating and if the hedge on that from time to time based on interest rate movement but there will be a component of that that is deemed to be ineffective that ineffectiveness is run through net interest income overtime it will work itself out to zero but they are longterm hedges so one quarter it might be up a little bit one quarter it might be down it was unusually positive in the fourth quarter of  so when you look on our schedule on the earnings release on page  and you look at the yield on longterm debt thats where the noise is coming from that longterm debt is basically just floating but you might have noticed in the quarter that we saw  in the fourth quarter we saw a  yield down substantially from the third quarter that was because of gains on that  from the ineffectiveness otherwise it would have been about  moving to the first quarter you saw it pop up to  well if you adjusted for the  if you take into consideration the impact it would have been down about  basis points from that so its moving up as you would expect it to move up on average with the movement in libor since that has been primarily swapped so i think its not a whole lot more complicated than that there is one other element and so that doesnt impact other trading at all we also hedge the spread between the overnight rate and libor and that does not get hedge accounting treatment on those swaps so a gain or loss on those runs through directly through trading and that creates some noise as well and again thats just averages itself out sometimes its a positive sometimes its a negative so the impact to this quarter has effectively overstated the fourth quarter nim and overstated the fourth quarters earnings by about  million and understated a little bit by this quarter and that was ultimately had about a  basis point sequential negative impact to the nim so when we look out forward we just assume thats going to average itself out its very difficult for us to predict and thats why we do call it out brian bedell and so that averaging out is included in your  to  guidance for the thomas gibbons yes yes it is im not suggesting weve got a recovery from anything that weve done now just going forward we assume its zero brian bedell okay so locked in for q and then zero for the next three quarters thomas gibbons right brian bedell and then how many fed hikes are you  additional fed hikes after the march quarter you were including in the fourth… thomas gibbons yes it looks  it depends on the day that you do the calculation but as we prepared for this we had two additional fed hikes in that forward curve brian bedell okay and then just my followup would just be on the  ill try maybe to talk a little bit more about the clearing business its been actually very strong considering the client runoff maybe if you can just talk about the tempo this year and that if there is any more attrition from the clients that have departed and then you mentioned a lot of elements of crossselling within your own franchise and the benefits from the fiduciary rule coming through is that going to create stronger tailwinds coming into the second half of this year so that rules here gets implemented brian shea yes good question brian its brian shea i would say this clearing business has been remarkably resilient and despite the fact that weve had some large client losses over the last year or two mostly driven by global wealth firms exiting the us marketplace which were big pershing clients despite that the core underlying business has been performing pretty well and the metrics are starting to improve were seeing a pretty solid pipeline of large firms including selfclearing firms reconsidering whether or not theyre going to outsource their clearing those tend to be choppy but were encouraged by the trend and we think we have the right platform to help to be the solution to that were also  have invested in an integrated bank and brokerage custody platform thats very appealing to wealth management firms and to registered investment advisory custody firms and our registered  our ria custody business is experiencing doubledigit growth and one of the things thats differentiating us is this private banking partnership with the wealth management group so just to give you an idea were up to about  billion in credit facilities established and over  billion in loans outstanding and thats the private bank of bny mellon making loans available to the high net worth investors of our ria custody clients and introducing brokerdealers clearing clients so thats good from a dol perspective its driving more traditional brokers to the advisory model which is part of the resiliency of that advisory growth and  but were also seeing now a trend toward mutual fund consolidation meaning that assets are moving to brokerage platforms or to the pershing platform as advisors want to actually include mutual funds into an asset allocation or advisory receipt relationship so thats a positive trend for pershing so overall we have a pretty good outlook and the revenue diversification of pershing is pretty strong so its been resilient brian bedell great thanks for that color thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy graseck good morning i had a couple of followup questions one on the slr discussion that you had earlier todd just wondering would you consider any changes to your press strategies in the event that there was an slr change thomas gibbons potentially i mean weve  as you know weve issued quite a bit of preferred over the past couple of years and weve kind of changed our capital stack so i think were pretty comfortable with that capital in fact we probably have a little more space that we could go if we wanted to so if the slr demand  and its largely to drive the tier  capital which is the numerator for the slr so if slr changes took place we would have to rethink that so i think the answer to that is yes betsy betsy graseck and is there any flexibility there im just wondering if theres kind of a noncall provision that youre dealing with for a number of years or not thomas gibbons yes no were  there are some noncalls on those but were quite comfortable with the capital and the cost of the capital i mean some of those seems to be below  so its certainly less costly than tier  so my expectation is that we would keep it in place its just a question of how much future issuance that we would do betsy graseck got it okay and on the regulatory expenses you  i think you indicated that currently youre running at high watermark  million i assume thats an annual number or is that a quarterly number thomas gibbons yes the  million guidance is something that we provided a while ago which is what we thought is the number of projects that were going to require to invest and would ultimately cost us between capital and expense the capital will obviously ultimately become an expense weve not given additional information against that but as we responded to last years letter we have increased the run rate spend just the monthly run rate spend on a number of different components of the resolution plan requirements that is what we expect to see to wind down a little bit in the second half of this year betsy graseck in the second half its  million in q and  million in q for a total of  million decline is that… thomas gibbons yes thats the guidance betsy graseck right i just want to make sure it was  million in total not just  million okay and then just last question nexen take up maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what youre seeing there and also what incremental your clients are asking for that youre focusing on delivering incremental functionality perhaps that you might be working on gerald hassell why dont i give you a couple of headline numbers and then brian you may want to give some color commentary on the natural initiatives with individual clients but today we have about  users on our nexen gateway  different businesses within the company are consuming it or putting applications up on it we have about  different clients who are accessing our api store we have about orso apis in our store there is about another  apis that are queued up to go into the store and so were seeing a pretty significant takeup and then the data thats coming out of our digital pulse has been captured and consumed mostly internally to improve our operations and find pockets of ways to automate and reduce our own structural cost so generally the takeup has been quite positive and the businesses are using it and were seeing real applications up and running on it brian shea yes i agree with that and i would just say in addition lets see were starting to build out the app store and actually the first thirdparty vendor will be live in the app store in the second quarter we have a pipeline of five or six that have committed that well be putting on over the next couple of quarters and then you know there is an even more robust pipeline of firms in discussion with us as we sort of execute this vision of delivering the digital investment platform that our clients need to reduce their vendor management integration discontinuity cost and help  and were going to enable that through nexen so again every two weeks we add more functionality more capabilities and were getting more traction with the clients and of course as a result the clients are starting to see more value incrementally every two weeks betsy graseck okay and anything in particular people are asking you to do that youre putting on the todo list or thomas gibbons i wouldnt say anything specific that would be  or shattering just continuing to deliver all the capabilities of the company through a single gateway and also enabling them through apis to integrate with us the way they want to work those are the two big drivers and frankly longer term as we execute this more fully were going to be easier to do business with and to geralds earlier point about improving the client experience its going to improve the client technology experience significantly and its going to make it easier for them to do more business across the company so not only  so we see this really creating longterm value for the company gerald hassell yes betsy the live situations with a number of clients tend to be around data aggregation and them being able to pull data out of the system in a much more easily consumed way versus us pushing mounts of reports that take days to produce and weve been able to shorten that reporting cycle down to minutes and in some cases for different fund companies and hedge funds so thats the initial set of applications operator our next question comes from the line of geoffrey elliott of autonomous research geoffrey elliott good morning thank you for taking the question on backs of the slr and the potential changes there how much flexibility do you think youve got on the level of capital you run with so that the numerator  part of the question just given that that cet is  i think you talk about running with a minimum of  basis points buffer over the regulatory minimums of kind of  i mean does that kind of limit the amount of flexibility youve got if were just focusing on the numerator side so the option is more around the denominator and how you can run the balance sheet differently thomas gibbons sure geoffrey its todd ill take this so first of all our minimum for the common equity tier  is  so were at  basis points over that on a full  for the fully phasedin so we feel like that feels like a pretty decent buffer certainly its adequate we would think for most of stress test at least as weve seen them in the past i think the  in terms of the slr i think that had been the binding constraint in the past but now that its up at  or close to  and at  in the institutional bank where it needs to be at  it too feels like it has a pretty good buffer to withstand two things that could potentially move that youre not going to see a lot of noise we wouldnt expect in the riskweighted assets so for the common equity tier  ratio but what you could see under the slr is an expansion of the balance sheet if there were big deposit flows so we think that gives us an adequate buffer and for that certainly in this new interest rate environment and secondly there are fluctuations and other compressive income that really comes out of the securities portfolio so weve structured the securities portfolio in such a way that if less rate sensitivity than it had been in the past and we think it could accommodate some fairly substantial increases in longterm rates which wed actually kind of like to see at this level of a buffer so we feel its pretty wellbalanced right now geoffrey elliott thanks and then on the cet again the advance ratio is a lot lower than the standardized ratio is there anything that youve heard recently that gives you confidence that the advance ratio could be relaxed a bit may be operational risk ought to be calculation changing or something like that thomas gibbons yes there is whats become known as basel iv has been batted about quite a bit at this point i would say its too hard to determine or its impossible to determine whether there is ultimately going to be adapted within that one of the considerations would be to change the treatment for operational risk which we would encourage i think would make some sense that would probably provide some relief to bny mellon and i think there are some other considerations that may very well offset that around market and other types of less other types so we dont  a we dont know whether its going to be adapted b its not the test that used in the ccar its the standardized test which almost has to be very difficult to run if off the advanced approach and get consistency so we dont know whether it will be adopted were not really sure ultimately what the impact would be to us its probably net positive on operational risk and slightly negative on the other items geoffrey elliott thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken good morning thanks for taking the question just a couple of followups at this point so helpful on the  million a quarter in consulting headwind here in the nearterm but taking a step back and i think you guys up made some comments about it previously if we end up in a lesser burdensome compliance and regulatory environment how should we think about how that might provide an additional lever for you to pull on the expense side and then if we think about how may be brexit might offset some of that they need to invest might offset some of that given how controlled you guys have been on the expense front for several years like when we put all that to mix over the next few years assuming we have regulatory relief how should we think about what could happen to operating expenses gerald hassell well let me take a high level stab at it and then todd you can weigh in some i think the way we contemplated to the extent that we have some sort of change in tone on the regulatory side that we can actually direct some more of our resources and frankly some of the higher intellectual capital that company is can be consumed by regulatory requirements if we can redirect it to new products and solutions and that is our goal as opposed to taking it dollarfordollar reduction in whatever expenses we may have from regulatory relief wed like to invest more in some of the businesses and some of the solutions we like to invest more in further automating the company which will drive better operating efficiencies for the longterm and so we would like to see some of it continue to go to shareholders but a lot of it reinvested in the company for future growth and for future improvements in our strategy and technology and automation thomas gibbons and i would add just a couple of things here if you think about the us regime there has been an awful lot of new rulemaking thats gone on and actually the implementation cost to comply with that and i probably said once or twice before that we think that the run rate has probably peaked and i was wrong but if you think about things like ccar even the advanced approaches to calculating the riskweighted assets ccar is continuously developed the resolution plan which comes with some new requirements for example around liquidity and capital management the liquidity coverage ratio and the  which is a demanding regulatory reporting exercise since were providing significant amounts of daily information so were getting all of that implementation in place and there will certainly be im sure no matter what the change in the regime ongoing requirements to improve that but wed like to think that we dont see a lot of new rulemaking out there because i think were getting all the way through really the doddfrank requirements so in the us there probably would be some relief regardless of what comes from  what the regime actually does i think globally one of the things that we broke out on our reports expense report is bank assessment charges and so the fdic charges have gone up substantially as have what we see both on the european resolution fund as well as just bank levies in certain parts of europe there is the potential for some relief on that but probably even thats a year away and the other thing i might add why we want to still be cautious here is that in europe as we implement method and other additional regulations the compliance cost there are quite high as well so were going to get  i think some shortterm relief whether that actually rolls into longterm relief or not its too early to call brennan hawken thats all really really fair and very helpful thanks and certainly todd i think youve got some company in trying to call a top on the regulatory burden and worse can you  one followup on the slr buffer i think you guys said that you would expect it to have from  bps to  when i had looked at i guess maybe i compared it to the enhanced buffer that it come up with and i thought maybe it might even be a bit lower for you what makes you think that it would only be halves for you rather than maybe even a potentially better outcome gerald hassell thats highly speculative on my part im just seeing it  if you were to correlate you might be right brennan if you were to correlate the  to the buffer  in the gsib ph buffer and you use the same regime to calculate it something like half i think would be a reasonable estimate but youre right it could be a little bit more than that brennan hawken fair enough great okay thanks operator and our final question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy thank you good morning gerald good morning todd a question todd and i know there has been a lot of talk about the balance sheet and i think you gave us guidance in your prepared remarks about basically a flattish balance sheet from here until the end of the year if you guys look longer out from your customers standpoint and we get into a  fed funds rate environment lets say going into  are there still lazy deposits if you will sitting on your balance sheet that would move into higheryielding alternatives or do you see with your current customer base that the deposits they have are truly what theyre probably going to keep with you even in a higher rising interest rate environment thomas gibbons okay so id like not to call them lazy because this is  a lot of this is related to activity that goes on corporate trust activity asset servicing activity settlements and so forth and we do think the betas will increase so therell be  and in many instances we actually have contractual rates that we apply to client deposits so i think the way to look out at the future is therell be  just as we saw the spike up in deposits with the fed easing i think well see that kind of market share gain if you will to total deposits come out which it practically has and then we will start  the business will grow the deposit size of the business will grow with activity as it has historically thats our expectation gerard cassidy yes no thats good and then i know this is a hypothetical and maybe will never come through the industry including you guys have suffered from the lcr ratio being as high as it is if there wasnt that requirement to have the lcr ratio as high as it is what do you think a more reasonable lcr ratio should be for you guys or are you comfortable with what it is now thomas gibbons well and ill be happy to comment on that one and the lcr may very well get some conversation but i think theres another thing that you should be aware off in the resolution plan theres something called the rlap which is the liquidity that you need in place in order to go in and manage a resolution plan thats going to be  its pretty highly correlated to the lcr so it could be another  its another constraint to that i think that you should be aware off and were working through that as we deliver it to the regulators this summer that being said the lcr is a constraint it does limit the types of things that you could do there is no question that it has an impact on lending and if you took into consideration that there are probably substantial amount of liquid assets on the balance sheet that dont fall into the denominator its probably more constraining than it really need to be i think conceptually its a very good tool its how  its an approach to managing liquidity that makes a heck of a lot of sense i think perhaps it could be tweaked a little bit if it were it would give more  its another one of these things that will provide more flexibility probably generate a little bit more nir gerard cassidy i appreciate it thank you so much gerald hassell thank you very much everyone for dialing in today and your interest in us and im sure youll have some followup questions with valerie and the rest of our ir team so thank you everyone operator
