from paint or coating while the door andor frame of the door are being painted andor coated more particularly the present invention provides a hinge covering system which allows for rapid and efficient installation of the system which accurately protects the door hinge while also maintaining unobstructed use of the hinge and thereby the doorin the field of painting building interiors interior doors and their frames must be painted as well as the interior walls and ceiling when painting the door and door frame area a common problem arises that paint or coating will adhere to door hinges supporting the door to the interior walls since the standard door hinges are metal with a polished finish paint adhered to the hinges generally has a nonaesthetic appearance and is therefore not desired when painting the building interior as such the hinges of the doors must be protected from paint and coating during the painting of the building interiorthe standard door hinge used in most modern homes and offices is comprised of three portions a left strap a right strap and a pin three screws are used to secure one strap to a frame and three additional screws secure the remaining strap to the door each strap has either a two open cylindrical portion or a three open cylindrical portion referred to as knuckles which are designed to interpose one another and receive the pin into the opening for securing the door to the frame and maintaining normal operation of the door when the hinge is in an operable state the knuckles and pin exposed between the door and the frame are referred to as the barrelthere are a variety of door hinge sizes available to the building industry they all vary in length and width depending on the size and weight of the door they are intended to supportthe most commonly used in residential housing is called a “butt hinge” each strap measures approximately ½″ in length and ½″ in width with the cylindrical portion measuring approximately ″ totaling the overall width to approximately ½″ this is a “full mortise hinge” the thickness of the hinge strap which is approximately ″ is recessed into the door and frame different styles are available the first style has two ⅝″ radius cuts on one edge of each strap the second style has two ¼″ radius cuts on one edge of each strap a third style has squared corners on each strap and the fourth style consists of one strap having a radius cut and the other strap squared the cylindrical protrusions that extend from each strap also vary in size depending on the hinge size standard premade residential hinges are readily available in the following dimensions ″ by ″ with ⅝″ radius corners½″ by ½″ with ⅝″ radius corners″ by ″ with ⅝″ radius corners½″ by ½″ with ¼″ radius corners″ by ″ with ¼″ radius corners½″ by ½″ with square corners⅝″ radius corners″ by ″ with square corners⅝″ radius corners in commercial building the most commonly used hinges are “architectural hinges” which range from ½″ to ″ in length and ″ to ″ in width these normally have a larger cylinder these hinges may also have the same radius cut on each strap or each strap could be different as with the “butt hinge” another style of commercial hinge is an “architectural ball bearing hinge” this type of hinge is used for large or very heavy doors these hinges are similar to the “butt hinge” and the “architectural hinge” with the exception of a ball bearing device which is machined into the knuckles allowing the hinge to carry more weight without wearing out or breaking standard premade commercial architectural hinges are readily available in the following dimensions ″×″ with square corners½″ by ½″ with square corners or square⅝″ radius″ by ″ with square corners or square⅝″ radius½″

radius½″ by ½″ with square corners or square⅝″ radius″ by ″ with square corners or square⅝″ radius several options are available for protecting the hinges during painting the two most common options are that the doors may be removed so that the hinges are not present during painting or the hinge may be covered with tape or similar adhesive which absorb any paint applied to the area of the door hinge and thereby protects the hinge however there are a number of drawbacks to utilizing either of these methods to protect the hingefirst removing the doors and hinges prior to painting and reinstalling the doors after painting is time consuming specifically each hinge is normally held to the door and the frame by six screws each of which must be individually removed and reinstalled alternatively if only the pin is removed from the cylinder portion to separate the door from the frame each strap would have to be taped separately and the doors could still only receive one coating on one side at a time further the doors must be stored during the painting process if the doors are to be painted and they were removed from the hinge this method would allow only one side at a time to receive the coating intended after drying the doors would be reversed and the other side coated these extra steps create a need for additional labor and therefore add further time consumption to the painting processsecond covering the door hinges is either also time consuming or is inadequate to properly protect the hinges the portions of the hinge exposed during the painting process must be protected in a manner which adequately covers the hinge but also does not disrupt the painting or coating of the door and frame in order to properly shape common painting tapes to cover the hinge requires additional time as the pieces of tape must be cut and sized at the job site hence properly forming the tape at the job site also requires additional labor and thereby further adds time consumption to the painting process alternatively the protective tape is applied in a rapid manner without regard to exactly matching the area of the exposed hinge this taping procedure results in poor protection which in turn results in either paint adhered to the hinge or lack of adequate paint coverage to the door andor frame hence the aesthetic value of the painting is decreasedan additional problem which results from covering the hinges with a protective adhesive is that operation of the door becomes difficult due to adhesive being in contact with the moving portions of the door hinge specifically the standard door hinge includes a barrel portion which is exposed between the door and the frame this barrel portion is rotated within itself when the door is opened and closed adhesive of a protective coating is likely to either interfere with the operation of the door andor pull or disfigure the protective tape thereby disrupting the protective tapes coverage of the hinge in some instances the protective tape may even be pulled off by repeated opening and closing of the door leaving the hinge exposed during paintingin response to these problems of protecting door hinges during painting a number of solutions have been presented however each of these solutions fails to adequately and efficiently cover the door hinge and also maintain unobscured operation of the door specifically preconfigured tape or masks for paint protection of hinges have been disclosed in us pat nos      and the   and  patents each disclose masks which are flexible members that have a pressure treated sensitive adhesive coating and are preshaped to be applied over the hinge however the  and  masks are useable only with the doors that have been removed from the hinges or separated from the door frame hence the design of the  and  prevents them from being installed or applied to a door that is in an operable position further the masks offer no coverage to the top and bottom of the pin and barrel portions of the hingethe  device maybe applied to a door in an operable position the  device consists of two monolithic parts one of which is configured to provide full coverage of the front faces of the leaves and barrel of the assembled hinge the other being configured to cover the exposed parts of the back faces of the leaves and barrel however this system includes adhesive applied to the rotating barrel portion of the hinge thus the  device will interfere with the operation of the door andor be removed by the opening and closing of the door based on the adherence of the mask system to the moving barrel portionus pat no  discloses a system comprising a pad with a protective coating that is peeled off from a cut out and applied to the hinge us pat no  is very similar to the  patent in that they both have small rectangular protrusions that extend from the main body of the adhesive these are intended to cover the knuckle portions of the hinge one side having two protrusions and the other side having three protrusions as these protrusions have adhesive to secure the protective coating to the knuckle they will interfere with the operation of the door andor be removed by the opening and closing of the door based on the adherence of the mask system to the moving barrel portionthe  and  also suffer from the defect that it is difficult to align all of these protrusions and the corners of the main body of the plate at the same time the piece with three protrusions has to be used on the appropriate hinge plate and the one with the two protrusions has to be used on the remaining hinge plate further throughout an entire house there are left hand swing doors which open to the left and right hand swing doors which open to the right thus the systems of the  and  patent would be confusing to use due to difficulty ensuring that the right piece of hinge cover is applied to the correct side of the hinge plate also all doors in a house or office do not always open to the hinges fullest capability due to a wall or another object of some sort restricting the movement therefore the small protrusions that extend from the body of the hinge plate cover would have to either be trimmed back or tucked into the very thin space between the rotating pieces if this is not done the protrusions would overlap onto the opposite hinge cover and could then break loose due to the movement of the rotating pieces the portion of the hinge barrel that is seen when the door is completely closed is covered in the same manner having to align the protrusions with the rotating portionsadditional tape hinge systems have been proposed which utilize protective magnetic or plastic coverings over the door hinges however there has not been disclosed to date a hinge tape system which is able to efficiently and accurately cover a door hinge in a manner which does not interfere with the doors operation andor prevent the covering from being damaged disjointed or removed

double door which are ¾″ wide and approximately ″ long by removing about four of the first preformed tape pieces from the roll and maintaining the perforation d between the pieces to completely cover the slide lock e fig c illustrates the first preformed tape pieces  stored prior to use as a roll  the first preformed tape pieces are adhered front surface to back surface as a standard roll of tape thus additional sheets for laminating the tape pieces to maintain the adhesive during prior use storage are not required thereby allowing efficient use with minimal waste productthe second preformed tape piece comprises a masking having an adhesive on only a part of one surface for example for a standard residential door hinge the second preformed tape piece comprises a ″ by ½″ masking having an adhesive on only a part of one surface as illustrated in fig  the second preformed tape piece  comprises a first surface a which is free of adhesive the first surface a faces outward from the hinge to provide protection from painting and coating the second surface b faces inward for contact with the hinge and storage as a tape roll the second surface b has a “deadened” center c about ⅞″ wide which extends the full length of the second preformed tape piece  this deadened center c is free of adhesive whereas the remainder of the second surface b has adhesive applied thereto forming adhesive areas d as illustrated in fig a in order to assist the user in application of the second preformed tape piece  to the hinge  the first surface a maybe provided with a marking e to indicate the location of the deadened center c in relation to the adhesive areas d on the second surface b the first surface a may also be provided with the word barrel f stamped along the center between markings e to assist the user in proper application the first surface a may also be provided with a mark g along the perforation to insure accuracy in tearingfig b illustrates the second preformed tape piece  as applied in the hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment to the interior center hinge portion a the second preformed tape piece  overlays the hinge  so as to completely cover the interior center hinge portion a with the deadened center c of the second preformed tape piece  the second preformed tape piece  overlays end portions of the first preformed tape pieces ab the adhesive areas d are applied to the inner portion of the hinge straps thereby securing the second preformed tape piece  to the hinge  since the deadened center c of the second preformed tape piece  is free of adhesive the tape piece  will not interfere with the rotating motion of the knuckles and pin of the hinge  when the door is in operation hence the door will maintain unobscured operation while the interior center hinge portion a is protected without adhesive pulling the tape piece  loose or disrupting the coverage by the tape piece  by contacting the knuckles or pinfig c illustrates the second preformed tape piece  as applied in the hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment to the exterior center hinge portion b the second preformed tape piece  is applied over the exterior center hinge portion b on the opposite side of the door and frame as to the interior center hinge portion a similar to above the deadened center c of the second preformed tape piece  is applied to the knuckle and pin portion comprising the exterior center hinge portion b so as to prevent adhesive from contacting these rotating portions of the door hinge  the adhesive areas d are applied to exterior exposed areas of the strap portion of the door hinge these adhesive areas d are preferably tucked into the space between the door and the straps by any common means such as a in tool or putty knife thereby the exterior center hinge portion b is protected from paint and coating while maintaining unobscured operation of the door and insuring that the second preformed tape piece  will remain in place even with repeated use of the doorfig d illustrates the second preformed tape piece  stored prior to use as a roll  the second preformed tape pieces are adhered front surface to back surface as a standard roll of tape thus additional sheets for laminating the tape pieces to maintain the adhesive during prior use storage are not required thereby allowing efficient use with minimal waste productfig  illustrates a third preformed tape piece  comprising a first surface a which is free of adhesive the first surface a faces outward from the hinge to provide protection from painting and coating the second surface b faces inward for contact with the hinge strap and storage as a tape roll the third preformed tape piece  also consists of having preformed corners cd on opposite sides thereof to correspond to the exact shape of the door hinge strap to be covered for example a third preformed tape piece  for a standard residential hinge strap would have both ¼″ c and ⅝″ d rounded corners the outer surface a may also be provided with the word strap e stamped on the surface to assist the user in proper application of the tape system the surface a also provides a mark f along each perforationfig a illustrates the third preformed tape piece  as applied in the hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment for example for a standard residential door hinge the third preformed tape piece is about ½″ by ½″ with a side thereof having adhesive to be placed on the outer strap portion of the exposed hinge  the third preformed tape piece  is applied to cover the interior exposed hinge strap portions and partially overlay the second preformed tape piece  this third tape piece  preferably has corresponding corners ab on one side thereof to conforming to the exact shape of the door hinge strap to be protected the outer surface of piece  may also be provided with the word strap h stamped on the surface to assist the user in proper application of the tape systemthe corners of the third preformed tape piece may be formed to match any two door hinge strap corners most preferable the third preformed tape piece  is precut to fit either a door hinge strap with a radius of ¼″ or ⅝″ the majority of residential prehung door hinges have a ⅝″ radius cut or less common a ¼″ radius cut in order to accommodate either of these hinge sizes the third preformed tape piece is shaped so that one side of the masking has a ¼″ radius cut on the upper right corner and the same cut on the lower right corner a ⅝″ radius cut is on the upper left corner and has the same cut on the lower left corner therefore enabling not only this roll but the entire kit to be used on two different radius hinges by simply rotating the third preformed tape piece to have the exterior corners match the exterior corners of the hinge strap still further a square cut corner can be combined with either of the two rounded corners to correspond to a square cut hinge strapas illustrated in fig b illustrates the third preformed tape piece  stored prior to use as a roll  the third preformed tape pieces are adhered front surface to back surface as a standard roll of tape thus additional sheets for laminating the tape pieces to maintain the adhesive during prior use storage are not required thereby allowing efficient use with minimal waste productas set forth above the hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment utilizes a total of six preformed tape pieces two each of the first second and third preformed tape pieces to cover a single door hinge with the hinge tape system the door maybe opened to the full limit of the hinge or to a lesser degree and the tape system will maintain full protection of the hinge the pieces described above are designed so that each covers a particular portion of the surface of the hinge despite the position of the hinge when the hinge plate the hinge pin upper and lower portion and the barrel are covered using this system there is no area of the door or frame that is restricted from an intended coating nor is the hinge subject to paint overspray or paint splattersthe hinge tape system is not limited to three preformed tape pieces but may include other tape pieces or configurations which cover the exposed portions of a door hinge for example a fourth optional roll may also be included comprising a ¼″ tape to be used to protect the very top portion of the hinge straps that protrude from the recessed portion of the door and the door frame however as this area of the hinge is most commonly not visible there is often no loss of aesthetic value by painting or coating this areafurther the hinge tape system may be comprised of preformed tape pieces which match commercial hinges or other specially designed hingesthe foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the present invention further since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and applications shown and described and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be regarded as falling within the scope of the invention in the appended claims and their equivalents   previous patent special improved adjustable hinge devicenext patent hinge with multiple stay positions home search services communities help contact us advertise on this site
