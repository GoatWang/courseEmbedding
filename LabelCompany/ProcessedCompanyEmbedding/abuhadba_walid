its just like his issued one reviewer melissa mcgee  great fit breathable plenty of room around band for accessoriesgear great product very pleased reviewer kaeden  just recieved in the mail today very well made fairly stiff im very happy first time customer will be ordering more from this website in the future thank you abu reviewer isaac minck  great to see gear in the ol abu sizing guidelines dont work reviewer craig  the product is great i tried twice following their guidelines and neither one fits i will probably still shop here for other things but i am not real happy with this time response from tacticalgearcom im sorry to hear you werent happy with the sizing craig if you need help with a return or if you ever have questions on sizing for other products please feel free to reach out wed be happy to help great hat reviewer anthony cashia  light weight great to wear my hat was to big reviewer d g  make sure you get the propper measurement of your cranium boonie hat reviewer wilson  measured head used adjacent chart came in perfect fit product appears to be quality will be testing it in the yard swamps and on the coastline thank you ps repels rain well used it today so comfortable reviewer tony silva  love this been looking for one for a while saw tactical gear had a great deal couldnt pass it up fits nice and very comfortable love it reminds me of my old boonie perfect reviewer pierre chubre  could not have been more satisfied with all my purchases best hat reviewer frank kopp  very well made just what i expected should last for years iron clad boonie reviewer bob gillette  this propper boonie is much tougher than what i got in the seventies think it is the inclusion of nylon that makes it so tough it also sheds water better have used in rain and is very effective high quality for low cost just what i expected reviewer mitch k  just what i expected perfect fit and like the vents perfect hat reviewer steven kelly  a great hat had to return size to big new fits great reviewer tom mickey  great product  will deal with this company again perfect reviewer carl webber  great product excellent boonie hat reviewer teofilo fernandez  this boonie hat washed well has retained its shape and reminds me of my original boonie hats  ilike the hat but i need a   size hat reviewer dwight  i like the hat but i need a   size hat it fits better and when it is washed it fits perfectly great reviewer lynn  great hat especially for the price my son loves it a touch tight reviewer wolfman  a bit tight but with some wear i should loosen up great fit design and quality reviewer william hada  hi all i am glad that i listened to their suggestion and ordered one size up its a perfect fit would have been too tight otherwise its a good looking hat and i was surprised at the quality for such a low price very happy with this purchase great boonie hat  reviewer sher  great hat at a good price  propper boonie reviewer warren  ilike the boonie hats for sun cover prooper makes a good boonie hat reviewer dylan  hat very nice hat reviewer paul  sizing is accurate hat is high quality good product reviewer bigguy  good quality hat at a fair price great gear reviewer jerry  this is going to be the last hat that the deer thought they might have spoted boonie hat reviewer charles thomas  could use a heavier fabric on the top otherwise i am pleased love it reviewer fallenraider  great boonie so far boonie hat tiger reviewer richard  thanks this will serve me well a bit stiff new needs to be broken in like i did in the nam  i lost the original copy and couldnt bring back the real one to the world thanks for your gear and service loonie for this boonie reviewer jeff  great quality and construction top notch as advertised could be better reviewer bh  bought this in woodland before they stoped selling that color and it appears to be made well however the brim is unevenly sewn resulting in it measuring about  on one side and  on the other  although i have worn the hat i am not very happy with it and only kept it because it cost to more then its worth to send back great hat reviewer ak  boonie hats dont get much better than this the  nylon cotton is a bit lighter weight than the poly cotton contrary to the sites recommendation the sizing of this hat is accurate only order a size up if you want it to fit a little more relaxedloose the polycotton version is a bit stiffer and can feel tighter as a result i own both one of the best boonie hats out there reviewer anonymous  its a great hat its my second hat so far from this site and it has a beautiful design in my opinion this hat also does not need any adjustments with the size good product but does not run small reviewer praetorian  this is my second propper boonie bought from another site as expected good quality item from propper however similar to the review i had on the propper abu utility caps item number f i found this item true to size and did not appear to run small ymmv the first site advised their boonies to be bigger and advised to buy a small size down reordering another for me probably resell this one to a colleague one star off show more
