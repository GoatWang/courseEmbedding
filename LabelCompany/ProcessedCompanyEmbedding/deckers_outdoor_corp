the zacks consensus mark by a wide margin top line also came ahead of our estimate after missing the same in the preceding two quarters betterthanexpected results and an upbeat fiscal  earnings

analysts commented we remain positive on deck heading into fq results on thursday may  amc we are projecting eps of c vs c consensus given the activist involvement we believe fq is largely inconsequential to the stock from a saleseps perspective in our opinion the most important driver for the stock continues to be the ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives recall the company

well for orders the bigger focus will be on the m in total cost savings deck is pursuing and the potential for further marginenhancing initiatives we are modeling deck to show a decline in sga dollar

steve it has been a productive first year as ceo and a lot has transpired over the last  months i am confident in the changes we are making to the business and believe the results of the last two quarters are providing the organization with the momentum needed to achieve the goals we have set for fiscal  through fiscal  the team has stepped up to the challenge and we are making significant progress in establishing the building blocks that will make us a more nimble efficient and profitable company some highlights for the last  months include the formulation of our  million operating profit improvement plan implementation of marketplace transformation with a focus on elevating the consumer experience the ugg brands progress in diversifying its spring and summer lineup enhancing our omnichannel capabilities and launching new products and categories including the ugg classic ii and new hoka styles these accomplishments along with all the other initiatives our employees are tackling make me confident that the steps we are taking are in the best interest of our brands and consumers and will also drive longterm shareholder value importantly our results are beginning to show the progress we are making fiscal  is off to a good start and continuing the momentum of the fourth quarter sales came in better than expected at  million which was driven by a few factors first timing as we shipped approximately  million of wholesale orders earlier than expected to optimize marketplace opportunities second stronger than expected global reorders for ugg hoka and teva spring product reflecting consumer demand for these products and third double digit ecommerce growth which drove a  increase in dtc comparable sales the combination of higher sales and a decline in sga expenses of  million driven by our cost savings plan resulted in a nongaap loss per share of  a significant improvement over the loss of  same quarter last year before tom walks you through more details of our financial performance i will provide an overview of our brand and omnichannel performance and update you on the progress we are making on our operating profit improvement plan starting with our fashion lifestyle group the first quarter is typically the lowest revenue quarter for the group however our continued focus on developing compelling spring and summer product new key wholesale partnerships and the strengthening of our ecommerce business is quickly raising the significance of this quarter ugg sales came in better than anticipated  million fueled by growth in the spring and summer product line combined with some earlier than planned fall shipment our ugg springsummer collection continues to make great strides especially in the sneaker and sandal category as the tye and sammy sneakers and kari sandals sold out at wholesale across all regions in particular we are very encouraged with the performance of these categories which combined were up  yearoveryear this performance gives us confidence that our focus on developing compelling spring and summer product is resonating with our consumers and gaining traction in the marketplace initial reaction for springsummer  is very positive and its contributing to the changing perception of ugg as a spring and summer brand on top of the positive response to our current offering first quarter ecommerce sales continued to benefit from our omnichannel capabilities and digital marketing efforts such as shipfromstore clickandcollect and infinite ugg these capabilities provide the consumer more flexible ways to shop while also allowing us to manage dtc inventory levels more efficiently our performance lifestyle group delivered a very strong quarter led by the hoka brand which continues to exceed expectations hoka revenues grew  to  million versus  million last year driven by a  increase in domestic wholesale sales along with solid gains in the international wholesale business included in the wholesale beat  was a robust reorder business across all regions a great indication that the brand continues to gain share in the run specialty channel the hoka team continues to do an amazing job introducing awardwinning shoes with the challenger atr  winning runners world editors choice for the best trail shoe the hupana listed as one of the best new running shoes by womens health and the speedgoat  receiving best new update from competitor magazine this recognition validates the teams effort towards building brand awareness across product categories and regions centered on delivering compelling product with exceptional technical performance teva sales were up  in the quarter to  million compared to  million last year sales in the quarter were better than expected due to global wholesale sales and strong global reorders we also saw meaningful gross margin improvement with the teva brand and we expect margin improvement across the remainder of the year sanuk sales of  million were slightly down to last year largely due to rationalizing our international distribution and a retail store transfer as we focus on our domestic wholesale business we perform better than expected with yearoveryear growth and improved gross margins im encouraged by the marketing and product initiatives these two brands are implementing as well as their focus on driving efficiencies in their respective businesses turning now to our channel performance direct consumer posted a  comparable sales increase our largest gain in several quarters the doubledigit positive comp was due to the strength in global ecommerce sales across both the fashion and performance lifestyle groups and slightly better than expected retail performance as our consumers continue to migrate their purchasing online the digital infrastructure we put in place over the last few years is driving significant growth with all regions posting doubledigit increases in the quarter our wholesale channel exceeded expectations with  growth yearoveryear domestic wholesale was up  to  million and was primarily driven by strong demand for hoka international wholesale also had a strong quarter up  versus last year to  million with our emea business up over  and apac up over  the strong international performance was due to solid reorders with the ugg hoka and teva brands our industry is facing strong headwinds across the wholesale and retail channels as traffic continues to be pressured and consumers are shifting their purchasing from brickandmortar to online as well as migrating to a buynowwearnow model and there are no indications that these are subsiding to that extent our path forward will not be without hurdles but the focus will remain on the customer our brands and products and achieving a level of profitability that will drive shareholder value for that reason coupled with the strong performance in the quarter we believe we are wellpositioned to address these challenges with our  million operating profit improvement plan to provide a quick update we are making significant progress in improving on our gross profit profile through consolidating our factory base moving production to more costeffective locations and optimizing our material usage we are also addressing improvements in our overhead through streamlining our organizational structure reducing inefficiencies in our corporate spend and optimizing our retail footprint these actions will result in operating profit improvement in fiscal year  with an operating margin target of  with that ill now turn the call over to tom thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp thanks dave and good afternoon everyone today i will take you through our fourth quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the second quarter and fiscal  guidance please note throughout this discussion when i refer to nongaap financial measures i am referring to results before taking into account restructuring and other charges that

nongaap results can be found in our earnings release that is posted on our website under the investors tab now to our results for the first quarter revenue was  million an increase of  million or up  versus last year this includes about  million of orders that were shipped earlier than previously expected as well as approximately  million of revenue growth driven by increases in our ugg ecommerce business and our hoka brand gross margin was  which was slightly better than expectations and compares to  last year the yearoveryear decline was driven by changes in foreign currency which negatively impacted the gross margin by  basis points nongaap sga expense was down  to  million compared to  million last year even with the higher sales sga dollars declined as we continue to realize savings from the implementation of our operating profit improvement plan nongaap loss per share was  for the quarter versus a loss of  last year in the first quarter we recorded  million in restructuring and other charges related to organizational changes and the strategic review process we are also pleased with the progress we are making on inventory management inventories were down  to  million compared to  million this time last year this was driven by higher sales recorded in the first quarter as well as improvements made in managing our inventory levels now moving to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal  we expect revenue to be down approximately  compared with the same period last year nongaap earnings per share is expected to be in the range of  to  compared to  last year to give a little color on the guidance there are a few things to keep in mind we shipped approximately  million of orders initially planned for the second quarter in the first quarter last year we launched womens classic ii and shipped a significant amount in the second quarter the combination of these two top line events explain the projected decline in earnings per share as compared to the same period last year for the full fiscal year  we are reaffirming the guidance we outlined on the last call we still expect sales to be in the range of down  to flat and earnings per share to be in the range of  to  on a share count of  million this excludes any pretax charges that may occur from any further restructuring charges we are encouraged by our first quarter results and believe it positions us well to achieve our fullyear outlook with that ill turn it over to dave for his closing remarks david powers  deckers outdoor corp thanks tom and thanks again to everyone for joining us today i am proud of

you please limit your questions to our financial results announced today thank you in advance for your cooperation with that well open up the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session our first question comes from the line of camilo lyon with canaccord genuity please proceed with your question camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc thank you good afternoon guys how are you david powers  deckers outdoor corp good hey camilo camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc yeah i wanted to get your thoughts on discussions that you may be currently having or have just had with retail partners with regards to any sort of delivery schedule pushouts weve heard from the channel that there have been particularly in north america thereve been discussions to delay receipts of fallwinter products into – well into the december quarter is that something that youre seeing and if so how are you planning your inventories around that david powers  deckers outdoor corp yes good question because i think thats the dynamic that were starting here is happening in the marketplace were seeing a little bit of that but its not a dramatic reason for the shift the biggest portion of our shift into q which is roughly about  million was really driven by the dynamic of the relaunch of the classic last year where accounts that were launched in the classic line to get the inventory in q to be able to hit it on the floor early in q now that they have that inventory some of that carryover inventory from last year theyre asking to take it just a little bit later but its a small piece of the total picture other than that were hearing a little bit about that but it hasnt really been significant to the flow of inventory yet for us yeah camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc okay great and then just shifting gears to the expense picture this quarter was a nice demonstration of some initiatives that you have in place with the dollar growth of  down  could you maybe articulate what were the areas of that reduction and how do we – how should we think about the cadence of expenses as the year progresses is that the run rate that we should be thinking about or is there a quarter in which we should expect to see a little bit more of a rampup as we get into the thrust of the  thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp camilo it broke up a little but you were talking about the operating expense savings we saw in the first quarter david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp okay good camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc yeah that – initially yes what drove that and how will the cadence shake out thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah we feel really pleased and were starting to demonstrate success there just like we said we would its pretty widespread some of it is due to lower store counts we have lower rent lower occupancy cost also within the stores we have lower material and supplies expenses we spent less capital this quarter so we have lower depreciation were seeing lower expenses in teva sanuk europe apac some of it is head count related and some of it just indirect expenses just getting more competitive on corporate overheads and we also had some marketing deficiencies in the quarter were pleased about really actual savings were more than reflected in the pl and that we had about  million in variable expenses that we had relative to the growth in sales so in terms of cadence you could see in the second quarter a similar amount of savings that you saw in the first quarter in the third quarter thats a more difficult comparison and that last years third quarter we had a reversal of the management incentive comp which was about a  million credit last year that this year well have savings but that credit becomes a tough comp so you get similar sga yearoveryear in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter you get similar amounts david powers  deckers outdoor corp similar dynamics yeah steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp yeah i think camilo said the important point is the flow through of the savings that youll see in the first half is greater to toms point because embedded in our guidance in the second half is an expected payout of performance comp so while were continuing to generate savings in the back half of the year were up against that reversal that we recorded last year of the performancebased comp camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc got it thats very helpful and this is the last one for me its just more of a housekeeping question could you just remind us what your ecommerce mix is today thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp in terms of by brand david powers  deckers outdoor corp of dtc or total business camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc yes well by brand predominantly david powers  deckers outdoor corp of the ecommerce business its mostly in the ugg business thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yes right steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp yeah david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah so generally speaking the ecommerce business yeah its obviously driven by ugg and its healthy for every brand as a critical portion of their total sales thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp for the quarter just to put it in perspective of total dtc both retail and ecommerce it was about  million for the quarter that is the lowest quarter david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp second quarter theres some – a little bit of growth there sequentially but the big quarters are the december quarter and then the march quarter david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah but obviously very pleased with the results that were seeing and the efforts that were focusing on technology digital marketing merchandising are starting to pay off in that channel which we see as a critical growth driver going forward steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp and demonstrated in our better than expected dtc comp david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah exactly yeah camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc right right so tom sorry so dtc was  million but what is ecommerce of that thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah we dont break down that out camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc or unit  thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah theres a lot of overlap there camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc yeah thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp and for instance in a store you can order product on an ipad and thats recorded as an ecommerce sale but its really generated in the store so weve been merging those two steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp  dtc thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc okay understood thanks guys good luck with the  future in front of you david powers  deckers outdoor corp thanks camilo operator our next question comes from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim please proceed with your question robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc hey guys good evening david powers  deckers outdoor corp hey bob robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc tom i guess a couple of questions for you on the ugg business i think last quarter you mentioned that you closed  of those  ugg accounts is there any update to where that is has that number changed dramatically any further and i was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the partnerships with macys and footaction six and maybe amazon thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah happy to so no real update on the amount of closures those that were closed over the course of the past six to eight months at this point we have the distribution that we have going into fall quarter a large amount of stores in a quantity perspective but not a large amount of revenue necessarily in regards to what it does to the total impact on the top line but feeling good about that progress and feeling good about the moves weve made and well continue to make to transform the marketplace and elevate the brand into the key channels and the key partners new accounts such as footaction macys amazon pleased with how things are progressing so far footaction the test we did last year had proved successful so theres future opportunity that were continuing with in that channel particularly driven by the mens business macys and amazon weve been in the current distribution since the st of january those are core accounts for us and so far so good working closely with those teams monitoring those businesses and pleased with the progress so far robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc got it and in terms of the outlook the fullyear outlook not really changing has there been any change to the order book for the ugg business thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah i mean bob i think the best way to look at that is we feel pleased with where the order book is really no changes from the – on the last earnings call we are now starting to book spring product we feel pleased how that is booking david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah i think as tom said the real change that were seeing so far is the early orders of spring  and based off the current sellthrough that weve seen particularly in the categories of sneakers and sandals in the ugg brand thats obviously good momentum as we go into selling seasons for spring  so the order book early indicators there are strong and were confident and pleased with the order book for going into q robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc right great thanks very much good luck guys david powers  deckers outdoor corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of corinna van der ghinst with citi research please proceed with your question corinna your line is live do you have us on mute corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc hi guys hi operator yes there we go corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc hi no we werent on mute sorry i dont know whats happening good afternoon guys david powers  deckers outdoor corp hey corinna corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc i was just hoping to ask a couple of followup questions on what was asked already just in terms of the – i know youre not going to give the actual order number or backlog number but just in terms of the composition of the backlog that you guys are looking at right now can you remind us what that looks like and also just the asp trend that youre expecting for this fall season thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp like again consistent with the last call we saw some as weve reported right we saw some growth in the backlog yearoveryear we saw the ugg business we were pleased with how that booked we saw more growth yearoveryear internationally for ugg than we did domestically in terms of asps david powers  deckers outdoor corp asp is going higher which is helping contribute to the improvement in gross margin thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah david powers  deckers outdoor corp so that does – weve made a transition to classic ii so well have more full price selling of classic ii this year as opposed to last year where we were still selling some classic i thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp right yeah david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah and were very pleased with how the classics business is set going into the year going through the transition from classic i into classic ii as we said allowed us to kind of reset the marketplace of inventory levels in the right distribution and the right account i would say we have a very good handle on the classics distribution right now and very pleased with the inventory levels expect that business to continue to be stable the upside as tom mentioned from international is a big part of the order book and then upside coming out of the mens business which were very excited about going into fall and continuing to build that growth so what i really like about the order book makeup is the diversity of it and continuing to expand in the channels and opportunities internationally as well as new categories such as mens and other footwear categories within womens corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay great and then i just wanted to ask a followup as well on the guidance that you guys maintained for the full year it only seems to imply kind of flat slightly positive top line growth in the back half of the year where do you see that guidance being conservative in terms of revenues at this point from based on what we know thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp we think the guidance that we put up there is the right guidance i mean as we commented we feel good where the order book is at this point in time normally if theres a potential for upside it is related to the – more in the dtc business that could happen as well as some reorders and thats more of a december quarter david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp area but it is early we feel really good where the business is headed feel really good the opportunity out there but it is early stages still and theres still a lot of business that gets done in november and december david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah i think based on what we can control we feel good as tom said its still very early in the year we got a long way to go still we believe were set up for successfully executing against our plan and our targets but theres still uncertainty in the marketplace and so we dont want to get ahead of ourselves but there is the potential upside is in reorders if we have a strong december were up against some tough comps last year in dtc because we were very cold in the last two weeks of the year and that really boosted our dtc business and then potential upside in hoka that business continues to drive more significant piece of the total revenue we had a great quarter with hoka theres strong momentum in there and there potentially could be upside from that brand going into q next year corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay wonderful and if i could just sneak one followup to your earlier comments about the gross margins can you just talk a little bit more about the measures that you guys have taken this year to improve your inventory management i know you talked about some of the omnichannel initiatives that have helped you with your dtc inventories and weve also talked in the past about the ugg closet being utilized more as a channel for clearance can you just kind of walk us through how – what gives you confidence in your ability to manage those better this year as we get into the fallwinter season thank you david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah i think generally speaking the focus of the organization as you know is on controlling costs and improving profitability so for every brand theyve been focused on reducing sku count reducing the amount of closeouts in inventory in the marketplace were starting to see the benefit of that particularly in the smaller brands you combine that with the reduction in costs that were starting to see come in from the improvements were doing with factory and yield utilization its a combination of all those factors but as i said i think really digging in and understanding where our inventory has been cleaning it up where its unproductive and unnecessary managing it more tightly than we have before and obviously the upside in sales helps but its a continued focus of the organization across all brands and regions to make sure that we get the most bang for our buck in our inventory in the marketplace right now and that were putting product on the market that has a high success rate of sellthrough corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of scott krasik from buckingham research please proceed with your question scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc yeah hi everyone thanks for taking my questions david powers  deckers outdoor corp hey scott thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp hi scott scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc so i guess it was probably september of last year when that sort of unauthorized product showed up at rue la la and there was some resale by i think it was a european distributor and some independent im just wondering how well you policed that this year and your expectations for product particularly classic ii showing up where its not supposed to david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah thanks for the reminder of that from last year interesting times but all joking aside we took that very seriously and we have been aggressively pursuing the control of that pricing in the marketplace as much as we can to that extent i think youre going to see the benefit of a number of things us im having stronger relationships with our accounts the number of accounts that weve closed over the last year and then aggressively just managing our pricing in the marketplace so we feel good about the work weve done over the last   months to get us into shape that were going into fall of this year particularly with the reset of the classic ii and the classic i inventory for all intensive purposes out of the channel and so its just something that the team with the new leadership and the north america sales force and theyre all over it and were monitoring it on a daily basis in the marketplace scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc thats good and then youre never a big brand on the nordstrom anniversary sale but you do have a handful of boots im just wondering what youve seen from that in terms of a more specially classic type looks the fashion product and then historically people have used this as an opportunity to buy classics just wondering if youre seeing that type of demand david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah we just had a productive meeting with the teams from nordstrom the other day feedback so far is that the wearnow – buynowwearnow product the more seasonal product is checking extremely well since slowness in the more traditional winter boot product which is i think is an indication of the marketplace being more focused on the buynowwearnow mentality but pleased with the new product and the seasonally appropriate product in the anniversary sale scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay and just last i dont think you bought any stock back this quarter is that part of the strategic review that youre not going to buy any shares back until the review is over steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp i think the best way to answer that is the boards strategic review process is ongoing in share buybacks among other things or some of the things that are being considered scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay all right thanks good luck david powers  deckers outdoor corp thanks scott operator our next question comes from the line of erinn murphy from piper jaffray please proceed with your question erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co all right thanks good afternoon just a couple of questions i guess first on the directtoconsumer business obviously being much better in q is there any change to what is contemplated in your fiscal  guidance for dtc comp this year thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp based off of how q performed erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co correct yeah i think the former guidance is upward single david powers  deckers outdoor corp no no erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co so youre – okay got it thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah were still reiterating that same guidance david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah right thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah exactly erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay and then just within the regions underlying debt comp could you just speak to how emea versus asia whether you want to break that out china japan versus the us performed within that  thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah at a high level on what these guys look at the detail strong performance across all regions and the focus of the organization on ecommerce channel the digital marketing capabilities the operations side of the site the product segmentation and merchandising on the site all paying off and contributing to the growth but very pleased with the growth across all brands and all channels – i mean sorry all regions in the ecommerce section of the business steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp which is why i might want to add one comment relative to the first quarter i mean were really pleased with that  keep in mind thats our lowest quarter a year ago as we were transitioned to our new erp system we missed about we scheduled it that way the first i think week and a half of last years first quarter we didnt have any ecommerce sales thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp cut over in the new system steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp because we cut over in the new system so it made it for an easier comp this year erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co got it thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp and then just in terms erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co yeah thanks for reminding thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yes region performance in europe was very strong north america was very strong and positive gains in asia but not as strong as europe and north america erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay and then just shifting gears i think following up on drbuls questions earlier on new accounts within macys how many doors are you at now versus where you were january  when you started rolling out that test and any thoughts on door potential over time david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah sure so the test we did last fall was  doors including the new concession in herald square we in january went to  doors for women then  doors i believe  doors for men and that will not change through the remainder of the year and from our perspective we think thats the right amount that represents the bestinclass of the macys footprint but also what we think is the best service location so its not selfservice its a traditional fit and fit approach and thats the game plan going forward theres obviously opportunity in more macys doors but were not contemplating that necessarily at this time and were going to play it through the rest of the year in the  doors that we are currently in whats also good to know about that is the diversity of the offering at macys is very strong so they have good support for the spring and summer product in womens and a very good support for the mens business going forward as well erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co got it thank you and then just last on hoka definitely a bright spot in the report can you just speak to the international footprint of that brand today and then what are the biggest opportunities from a growth perspective going forward david powers  deckers outdoor corp sure so internationally we have a strong business in europe thats really led by our french subsidiary and the growth opportunities over there are really around the uk and germany very similar to the ugg business we have a strong business for hoka surprisingly up in scandinavia small but very health with regards to the size of the business for the size of that market ecommerce uk germany continue to be the biggest growth opportunities for hoka in that market the teams are aggressively getting after that opportunity leveraging up the strength of the french market internationally very early days japan just started the business in a more direct way this year and initial indications look very good china the teams there are having initial indications with key partners in the marketplace of partnering with somebody to take that brand to market from a growth opportunity globally we still see tremendous growth within the run specialty channel in the us were currently number six according to npd in the run specialty channel we could still double the business in that channel and just crack number five or four in the brands that are in that channel today so thats where we continue to be focused the key is maintaining credibility and authenticity in that run specialty channel but really increasing awareness before we start contemplating more selfservice environments and as i said the growth opportunity in europe is uk and germany and then japan and china in addition to driving as much business as we can through our own ecommerce channel erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co thank you guys all the best david powers  deckers outdoor corp thanks thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp thanks operator our next question comes from the line of omar saad with evercore please proceed with your question omar saad  evercore group llc thanks thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask actually about the pull forward a little bit thats kind of having the strange effect on the revenue for this past quarter and the next one its a little bit counterintuitive as we keep hearing from retailers wanting to push deliveries out closer to need maybe you could talk a little bit about what drove the pull forward is it one of the new accounts or is it something going on with an existing account david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah its a combination really of two drivers the first is a lot of that inventory was pulled forward by distributors they picked up early at port and a lot of those planned receipts were on the cusp of june and july and so the inventory was there the distributors were able to pick it up early and they did and i think its still a lot of that inventory is still kind of in season its not necessarily fall product where i think youre still hearing about some of the pushouts so just the fact that we were ready to go and the accounts were willing and looking to take some of that early its more about inventory being on the cusp of july versus june about a quarter of that upside came from hoka which was driven by the eagerness to get the clifton  in to the marketplace for the july  weekend in north america and so fortunately we had a good transition from the clifton  the inventory was ready to go and the launch plans are ready to go so we allowed customers to pull that inventory in early so they could set up and sell over the july  weekend which is proving to be a smart move were getting – hearing good reports in the sellthrough and were seeing that also on our ecommerce channel and i think that could potentially lead to some upside for that brand in q but with regards to ugg its more budgets getting through the inventory they have and the normal course of business going into q and q omar saad  evercore group llc thanks dave and then on hoka which you were just mentioning how do we think about the marketing plan you mentioned the need to get the word out on the brand and what are you – are you piling in more dollars behind that is there a certain marketing approach brand awareness building approach that you guys are taking that could accelerate and then hit an inflection point at some point in the next couple quarters david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah great question because one of the key investments in our cost savings over the next three years is going to be hoka marketing we have the product obviously we have bestinclass product thats resonating with consumers we think we have the right creative to appeal to the core authentic hardcore runner but also the female consumer and the lifestyle consumer so the investment that were going to make is really in driving awareness through continued ontheground events having a presence there so we remain authentic and important in doing tryon sessions where we can heavy heavy focus on digital and segmented offering in reaching the consumers that with relevant product for how theyre going to use the product you wont see any tv or outofhome or things of that sort but its just a matter of ramping up and getting very targeted on the consumers that we think are appropriate for this brand and the product it is the heavier investment in marketing currently than the rest of the brands and well continue to invest in that brand even more so going forward particularly when the cost savings start hitting the bottom line in a more aggressive way omar saad  evercore group llc got it and then if i could squeeze one more question on ugg how do we think about the piece of the business now thats really driven by some of the innovations in the last few years things like the luxe and the slim and the classic ii are those big franchises in a big component of the overall ugg kind of qq sales volume and are there other updates on these types of platforms that could also be important this year thanks david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah great question and we had a fantastic meeting the other day where we reviewed the entire classics offering and then we had a great conversation around how we start segmenting that now that weve reset the classics franchise we have extensions off the core into the slim and luxe and the street style now were focusing on where we can segment those styles and then where we can innovate off of those styles so youll see a little bit of that this fall if you remember last year we said the first priority was reset the classics franchise and then were going to focus on extending – on the extension beyond that in fashion but going forward youre going to see more iterations off of the slim and the luxe in repositioning those based off the segmentation strategy theyre all performing well theyre becoming a more significant part of the business were learning on – a lot about who is gravitating to each of those styles whether its a younger consumer or an older consumer the channels that they like to shop in but it is giving us a broader platform to build off of and as far as innovation coming this year well be launching the first ever waterproof classic into the channel this year into wholesale and retail and my instinct tells me that thats going to be a strong seller that we can build off going forward as well omar saad  evercore group llc thanks for all the color good luck david powers  deckers outdoor corp thank you thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp omar thank you operator thats all the questions we have in queue id like to turn the call back over to dave powers for closing comments david powers  deckers outdoor corp in closing i am very pleased with the results of the quarter and while it represents only one quarter of our longterm plan it gives me great confidence in the teams ability to execute on driving improved profitability over the long term we are urgently addressing the challenges of a dynamic marketplace with the continued focus on our customer and our product evolution the success we saw with the uggs spring and summer offering the numerous awards won by hoka and the progress seen in teva and sanuk speak to how we are driving the business forward improvements in our supply chain efforts reducing corporate overhead rightsizing the retail fleet and rationalizing our wholesale account base demonstrate how we are tacking our cost structure to increase profitability the combination of these efforts will lead us to longterm targets we articulated in the last call with an operating margin of  by fiscal year  im very proud of the deckers team their hard work and dedication which have gotten us to this point now

in the best interest of our brands and consumers and will also drive longterm shareholder value importantly our results are beginning to show the progress we are making fiscal  is off to a good start and continuing the momentum of the fourth quarter sales came in better than expected at  million which was driven by a few factors first timing as we shipped approximately  million of wholesale orders earlier than expected to optimize marketplace opportunities second stronger than expected global reorders for ugg hoka and teva spring product reflecting consumer demand for these products and third double digit ecommerce growth which drove a  increase in dtc comparable sales the combination of higher sales and a decline in sga expenses of  million driven by our cost savings plan resulted in a nongaap loss per share of  a significant improvement over the loss of  same quarter last year before tom walks you through more details of our financial performance i will provide an overview of our brand and omnichannel performance and update you on the progress we are making on our operating profit improvement plan starting with our fashion lifestyle group the first quarter is typically the lowest revenue quarter for the group however our continued focus on developing compelling spring and summer product new key wholesale partnerships and the strengthening of our ecommerce business is quickly raising the significance of this quarter ugg sales came in better than anticipated  million fueled by growth in the spring and summer product line combined with some earlier than planned fall shipment our ugg springsummer collection continues to make great strides especially in the sneaker and sandal category as the tye and sammy sneakers and kari sandals sold out at wholesale across all regions in particular we are very encouraged with the performance of these categories which combined were up  yearoveryear this performance gives us confidence that our focus on developing compelling spring and summer product is resonating with our consumers and gaining traction in the marketplace initial reaction for springsummer  is very positive and its contributing to the changing perception of ugg as a spring and summer brand on top of the positive response to our current offering first quarter ecommerce sales continued to benefit from our omnichannel capabilities and digital marketing efforts such as shipfromstore clickandcollect and infinite ugg these capabilities provide the consumer more flexible ways to shop while also allowing us to manage dtc inventory levels more efficiently our performance lifestyle group delivered a very strong quarter led by the hoka brand which continues to exceed expectations hoka revenues grew  to  million versus  million last year driven by a  increase in domestic wholesale sales along with solid gains in the international wholesale business included in the wholesale beat  was a robust reorder business across all regions a great indication that the brand continues to gain share in the run specialty channel the hoka team continues to do an amazing job introducing awardwinning shoes with the challenger atr  winning runners world editors choice for the best trail shoe the hupana listed as one of the best new running shoes by womens health and the speedgoat  receiving best new update from competitor magazine this recognition validates the teams effort towards building brand awareness across product categories and regions centered on delivering compelling product with exceptional technical performance teva sales were up  in the quarter to  million compared to  million last year sales in the quarter were better than expected due to global wholesale sales and strong global reorders we also saw meaningful gross margin improvement with the teva brand and we expect margin improvement across the remainder of the year sanuk sales of  million were slightly down to last year largely due to rationalizing our international distribution and a retail store transfer as we focus on our domestic wholesale business we perform better than expected with yearoveryear growth and improved gross margins im encouraged by the marketing and product initiatives these two brands are implementing as well as their focus on driving efficiencies in their respective businesses turning now to our channel performance direct consumer posted a  comparable sales increase our largest gain in several quarters the doubledigit positive comp was due to the strength in global ecommerce sales across both the fashion and performance lifestyle groups and slightly better than expected retail performance as our consumers continue to migrate their purchasing online the digital infrastructure we put in place over the last few years is driving significant growth with all regions posting doubledigit increases in the quarter our wholesale channel exceeded expectations with  growth yearoveryear domestic wholesale was up  to  million and was primarily driven by strong demand for hoka international wholesale also had a strong quarter up  versus last year to  million with our emea business up over  and apac up over  the strong international performance was due to solid reorders with the ugg hoka and teva brands our industry is facing strong headwinds across the wholesale and retail channels as traffic continues to be pressured and consumers are shifting their purchasing from brickandmortar to online as well as migrating to a buynowwearnow model and there are no indications that these are subsiding to that extent our path forward will not be without hurdles but the focus will remain on the customer our brands and products and achieving a level of profitability that will drive shareholder value for that reason coupled with the strong performance in the quarter we believe we are wellpositioned to address these challenges with our  million operating profit improvement plan to provide a quick update we are making significant progress in improving on our gross profit profile through consolidating our factory base moving production to more costeffective locations and optimizing our material usage we are also addressing improvements in our overhead through streamlining our organizational structure reducing inefficiencies in our corporate spend and optimizing our retail footprint these actions will result in operating profit improvement in fiscal year  with an operating margin target of  with that ill now turn the call over to tom thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp thanks dave and good afternoon everyone today i will take you through our fourth quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the second quarter and fiscal  guidance please note throughout this discussion when i refer to nongaap financial measures i am referring to results before taking into account restructuring and other charges that our management believes are not core to our ongoing operating results also note our nongaap results are not adjusted for constant currency a reconciliation between our reported gaap results and the nongaap results can be found in our earnings release that is posted on our website under the investors tab now to our results for the first quarter revenue was  million an increase of  million or up  versus last year this includes about  million of orders that were shipped earlier than previously expected as well as approximately  million of revenue growth driven by increases in our ugg ecommerce business and our hoka brand gross margin was  which was slightly better than expectations and compares to  last year the yearoveryear decline was driven by changes in foreign currency which negatively impacted the gross margin by  basis points nongaap sga expense was down  to  million compared to  million last year even with the higher sales sga dollars declined as we continue to realize savings from the implementation of our operating profit improvement plan nongaap loss per share was  for the quarter versus a loss of  last year in the first quarter we recorded  million in restructuring and other charges related to organizational changes and the strategic review process we are also pleased with the progress we are making on inventory management inventories were down  to  million compared to  million this time last year this was driven by higher sales recorded in the first quarter as well as improvements made in managing our inventory levels now moving to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal  we expect revenue to be down approximately  compared with the same period last year nongaap earnings per share is expected to be in the range of  to  compared to  last year to give a little color on the guidance there are a few things to keep in mind we shipped approximately  million of orders initially planned for the second quarter in the first quarter last year we launched womens classic ii and shipped a significant amount in the second quarter the combination of these two top line events explain the projected decline in earnings per share as compared to the same period last year for the full fiscal year  we are reaffirming the guidance we outlined on the last call we still expect sales to be in the range of down  to flat and earnings per share to be in the range of  to  on a share count of  million this excludes any pretax charges that may occur from any further restructuring charges we are encouraged by our first quarter results and believe it positions us well to achieve our fullyear outlook with that ill turn it over to dave for his closing remarks david powers  deckers outdoor corp thanks tom and thanks again to everyone for joining us today i am proud of the deckers team for successfully executing our brand and channel growth initiatives and operating profit improvement plan and im confident that this momentum will continue while the industry faces continued challenges deckers remains

the dynamic marketplace and executing on our initiatives under our operating profit improvement plan to drive shareholder value our employees continue to amaze me with their dedication to our brand our strategy and most importantly our customers as a reminder with the strategic alternatives process ongoing we will not be commenting at this time so i ask that you please limit your questions to our financial results announced today thank you in advance for your cooperation with that well open up the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session our first question comes from the line of camilo lyon with canaccord genuity please proceed with your question camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc thank you good afternoon guys how are you david powers  deckers outdoor corp good hey camilo camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc yeah i wanted to get your thoughts on discussions that you may be currently having or have just had with retail partners with regards to any sort of delivery schedule pushouts weve heard from the channel that there have been particularly in north america thereve been discussions to delay receipts of fallwinter products into – well into the december quarter is that something that youre seeing and if so how are you planning your inventories around that david powers  deckers outdoor corp yes good question because i think thats the dynamic that were starting here is happening in the marketplace were seeing a little bit of that but its not a dramatic reason for the shift the biggest portion of our shift into q which is roughly about  million was really driven by the dynamic of the relaunch of the classic last year where accounts that were launched in the classic line to get the inventory in q to be able to hit it on the floor early in q now that they have that inventory some of that carryover inventory from last year theyre asking to take it just a little bit later but its a small piece of the total picture other than that were hearing a little bit about that but it hasnt really been significant to the flow of inventory yet for us yeah camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc okay great and then just shifting gears to the expense picture this quarter was a nice demonstration of some initiatives that you have in place with the dollar growth of  down  could you maybe articulate what were the areas of that reduction and how do we – how should we think about the cadence of expenses as the year progresses is that the run rate that we should be thinking about or is there a quarter in which we should expect to see a little bit more of a rampup as we get into the thrust of the  thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp camilo it broke up a little but you were talking about the operating expense savings we saw in the first quarter david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp okay good camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc yeah that – initially yes what drove that and how will the cadence shake out thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah we feel really pleased and were starting to demonstrate success there just like we said we would its pretty widespread some of it is due to lower store counts we have lower rent lower occupancy cost also within the stores we have lower material and supplies expenses we spent less capital this quarter so we have lower depreciation were seeing lower expenses in teva sanuk europe apac some of it is head count related and some of it just indirect expenses just getting more competitive on corporate overheads and we also had some marketing deficiencies in the quarter were pleased about really actual savings were more than reflected in the pl and that we had about  million in variable expenses that we had relative to the growth in sales so in terms of cadence you could see in the second quarter a similar amount of savings that you saw in the first quarter in the third quarter thats a more difficult comparison and that last years third quarter we had a reversal of the management incentive comp which was about a  million credit last year that this year well have savings but that credit becomes a tough comp so you get similar sga yearoveryear in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter you get similar amounts david powers  deckers outdoor corp similar dynamics yeah steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp yeah i think camilo said the important point is the flow through of the savings that youll see in the first half is greater to toms point because embedded in our guidance in the second half is an expected payout of performance comp so while were continuing to generate savings in the back half of the year were up against that reversal that we recorded last year of the performancebased comp camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc got it thats very helpful and this is the last one for me its just more of a housekeeping question could you just remind us what your ecommerce mix is today thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp in terms of by brand david powers  deckers outdoor corp of dtc or total business camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc yes well by brand predominantly david powers  deckers outdoor corp of the ecommerce business its mostly in the ugg business thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yes right steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp yeah david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah so generally speaking the ecommerce business yeah its obviously driven by ugg and its healthy for every brand as a critical portion of their total sales thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp for the quarter just to put it in perspective of total dtc both retail and ecommerce it was about  million for the quarter that is the lowest quarter david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp second quarter theres some – a little bit of growth there sequentially but the big quarters are the december quarter and then the march quarter david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah but obviously very pleased with the results that were seeing and the efforts that were focusing on technology digital marketing merchandising are starting to pay off in that channel which we see as a critical growth driver going forward steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp and demonstrated in our better than expected dtc comp david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah exactly yeah camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc right right so tom sorry so dtc was  million but what is ecommerce of that thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah we dont break down that out camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc or unit  thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah theres a lot of overlap there camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc yeah thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp and for instance in a store you can order product on an ipad and thats recorded as an ecommerce sale but its really generated in the store so weve been merging those two steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp  dtc thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah camilo lyon  canaccord genuity inc okay understood thanks guys good luck with the  future in front of you david powers  deckers outdoor corp thanks camilo operator our next question comes from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim please proceed with your question robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc hey guys good evening david powers  deckers outdoor corp hey bob robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc tom i guess a couple of questions for you on the ugg business i think last quarter you mentioned that you closed  of those  ugg accounts is there any update to where that is has that number changed dramatically any further and i was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the partnerships with macys and footaction six and maybe amazon thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah happy to so no real update on the amount of closures those that were closed over the course of the past six to eight months at this point we have the distribution that we have going into fall quarter a large amount of stores in a quantity perspective but not a large amount of revenue necessarily in regards to what it does to the total impact on the top line but feeling good about that progress and feeling good about the moves weve made and well continue to make to transform the marketplace and elevate the brand into the key channels and the key partners new accounts such as footaction macys amazon pleased with how things are progressing so far footaction the test we did last year had proved successful so theres future opportunity that were continuing with in that channel particularly driven by the mens business macys and amazon weve been in the current distribution since the st of january those are core accounts for us and so far so good working closely with those teams monitoring those businesses and pleased with the progress so far robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc got it and in terms of the outlook the fullyear outlook not really changing has there been any change to the order book for the ugg business thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah i mean bob i think the best way to look at that is we feel pleased with where the order book is really no changes from the – on the last earnings call we are now starting to book spring product we feel pleased how that is booking david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah i think as tom said the real change that were seeing so far is the early orders of spring  and based off the current sellthrough that weve seen particularly in the categories of sneakers and sandals in the ugg brand thats obviously good momentum as we go into selling seasons for spring  so the order book early indicators there are strong and were confident and pleased with the order book for going into q robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc right great thanks very much good luck guys david powers  deckers outdoor corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of corinna van der ghinst with citi research please proceed with your question corinna your line is live do you have us on mute corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc hi guys hi operator yes there we go corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc hi no we werent on mute sorry i dont know whats happening good afternoon guys david powers  deckers outdoor corp hey corinna corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc i was just hoping to ask a couple of followup questions on what was asked already just in terms of the – i know youre not going to give the actual order number or backlog number but just in terms of the composition of the backlog that you guys are looking at right now can you remind us what that looks like and also just the asp trend that youre expecting for this fall season thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp like again consistent with the last call we saw some as weve reported right we saw some growth in the backlog yearoveryear we saw the ugg business we were pleased with how that booked we saw more growth yearoveryear internationally for ugg than we did domestically in terms of asps david powers  deckers outdoor corp asp is going higher which is helping contribute to the improvement in gross margin thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah david powers  deckers outdoor corp so that does – weve made a transition to classic ii so well have more full price selling of classic ii this year as opposed to last year where we were still selling some classic i thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp right yeah david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah and were very pleased with how the classics business is set going into the year going through the transition from classic i into classic ii as we said allowed us to kind of reset the marketplace of inventory levels in the right distribution and the right account i would say we have a very good handle on the classics distribution right now and very pleased with the inventory levels expect that business to continue to be stable the upside as tom mentioned from international is a big part of the order book and then upside coming out of the mens business which were very excited about going into fall and continuing to build that growth so what i really like about the order book makeup is the diversity of it and continuing to expand in the channels and opportunities internationally as well as new categories such as mens and other footwear categories within womens corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay great and then i just wanted to ask a followup as well on the guidance that you guys maintained for the full year it only seems to imply kind of flat slightly positive top line growth in the back half of the year where do you see that guidance being conservative in terms of revenues at this point from based on what we know thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp we think the guidance that we put up there is the right guidance i mean as we commented we feel good where the order book is at this point in time normally if theres a potential for upside it is related to the – more in the dtc business that could happen as well as some reorders and thats more of a december quarter david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp area but it is early we feel really good where the business is headed feel really good the opportunity out there but it is early stages still and theres still a lot of business that gets done in november and december david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah i think based on what we can control we feel good as tom said its still very early in the year we got a long way to go still we believe were set up for successfully executing against our plan and our targets but theres still uncertainty in the marketplace and so we dont want to get ahead of ourselves but there is the potential upside is in reorders if we have a strong december were up against some tough comps last year in dtc because we were very cold in the last two weeks of the year and that really boosted our dtc business and then potential upside in hoka that business continues to drive more significant piece of the total revenue we had a great quarter with hoka theres strong momentum in there and there potentially could be upside from that brand going into q next year corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc okay wonderful and if i could just sneak one followup to your earlier comments about the gross margins can you just talk a little bit more about the measures that you guys have taken this year to improve your inventory management i know you talked about some of the omnichannel initiatives that have helped you with your dtc inventories and weve also talked in the past about the ugg closet being utilized more as a channel for clearance can you just kind of walk us through how – what gives you confidence in your ability to manage those better this year as we get into the fallwinter season thank you david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah i think generally speaking the focus of the organization as you know is on controlling costs and improving profitability so for every brand theyve been focused on reducing sku count reducing the amount of closeouts in inventory in the marketplace were starting to see the benefit of that particularly in the smaller brands you combine that with the reduction in costs that were starting to see come in from the improvements were doing with factory and yield utilization its a combination of all those factors but as i said i think really digging in and understanding where our inventory has been cleaning it up where its unproductive and unnecessary managing it more tightly than we have before and obviously the upside in sales helps but its a continued focus of the organization across all brands and regions to make sure that we get the most bang for our buck in our inventory in the marketplace right now and that were putting product on the market that has a high success rate of sellthrough corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of scott krasik from buckingham research please proceed with your question scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc yeah hi everyone thanks for taking my questions david powers  deckers outdoor corp hey scott thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp hi scott scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc so i guess it was probably september of last year when that sort of unauthorized product showed up at rue la la and there was some resale by i think it was a european distributor and some independent im just wondering how well you policed that this year and your expectations for product particularly classic ii showing up where its not supposed to david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah thanks for the reminder of that from last year interesting times but all joking aside we took that very seriously and we have been aggressively pursuing the control of that pricing in the marketplace as much as we can to that extent i think youre going to see the benefit of a number of things us im having stronger relationships with our accounts the number of accounts that weve closed over the last year and then aggressively just managing our pricing in the marketplace so we feel good about the work weve done over the last   months to get us into shape that were going into fall of this year particularly with the reset of the classic ii and the classic i inventory for all intensive purposes out of the channel and so its just something that the team with the new leadership and the north america sales force and theyre all over it and were monitoring it on a daily basis in the marketplace scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc thats good and then youre never a big brand on the nordstrom anniversary sale but you do have a handful of boots im just wondering what youve seen from that in terms of a more specially classic type looks the fashion product and then historically people have used this as an opportunity to buy classics just wondering if youre seeing that type of demand david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah we just had a productive meeting with the teams from nordstrom the other day feedback so far is that the wearnow – buynowwearnow product the more seasonal product is checking extremely well since slowness in the more traditional winter boot product which is i think is an indication of the marketplace being more focused on the buynowwearnow mentality but pleased with the new product and the seasonally appropriate product in the anniversary sale scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay and just last i dont think you bought any stock back this quarter is that part of the strategic review that youre not going to buy any shares back until the review is over steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp i think the best way to answer that is the boards strategic review process is ongoing in share buybacks among other things or some of the things that are being considered scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay all right thanks good luck david powers  deckers outdoor corp thanks scott operator our next question comes from the line of erinn murphy from piper jaffray please proceed with your question erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co all right thanks good afternoon just a couple of questions i guess first on the directtoconsumer business obviously being much better in q is there any change to what is contemplated in your fiscal  guidance for dtc comp this year thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp based off of how q performed erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co correct yeah i think the former guidance is upward single david powers  deckers outdoor corp no no erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co so youre – okay got it thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah were still reiterating that same guidance david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah right thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah exactly erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay and then just within the regions underlying debt comp could you just speak to how emea versus asia whether you want to break that out china japan versus the us performed within that  thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yeah at a high level on what these guys look at the detail strong performance across all regions and the focus of the organization on ecommerce channel the digital marketing capabilities the operations side of the site the product segmentation and merchandising on the site all paying off and contributing to the growth but very pleased with the growth across all brands and all channels – i mean sorry all regions in the ecommerce section of the business steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp which is why i might want to add one comment relative to the first quarter i mean were really pleased with that  keep in mind thats our lowest quarter a year ago as we were transitioned to our new erp system we missed about we scheduled it that way the first i think week and a half of last years first quarter we didnt have any ecommerce sales thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp cut over in the new system steve fasching  deckers outdoor corp because we cut over in the new system so it made it for an easier comp this year erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co got it thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp and then just in terms erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co yeah thanks for reminding thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp yes region performance in europe was very strong north america was very strong and positive gains in asia but not as strong as europe and north america erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay and then just shifting gears i think following up on drbuls questions earlier on new accounts within macys how many doors are you at now versus where you were january  when you started rolling out that test and any thoughts on door potential over time david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah sure so the test we did last fall was  doors including the new concession in herald square we in january went to  doors for women then  doors i believe  doors for men and that will not change through the remainder of the year and from our perspective we think thats the right amount that represents the bestinclass of the macys footprint but also what we think is the best service location so its not selfservice its a traditional fit and fit approach and thats the game plan going forward theres obviously opportunity in more macys doors but were not contemplating that necessarily at this time and were going to play it through the rest of the year in the  doors that we are currently in whats also good to know about that is the diversity of the offering at macys is very strong so they have good support for the spring and summer product in womens and a very good support for the mens business going forward as well erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co got it thank you and then just last on hoka definitely a bright spot in the report can you just speak to the international footprint of that brand today and then what are the biggest opportunities from a growth perspective going forward david powers  deckers outdoor corp sure so internationally we have a strong business in europe thats really led by our french subsidiary and the growth opportunities over there are really around the uk and germany very similar to the ugg business we have a strong business for hoka surprisingly up in scandinavia small but very health with regards to the size of the business for the size of that market ecommerce uk germany continue to be the biggest growth opportunities for hoka in that market the teams are aggressively getting after that opportunity leveraging up the strength of the french market internationally very early days japan just started the business in a more direct way this year and initial indications look very good china the teams there are having initial indications with key partners in the marketplace of partnering with somebody to take that brand to market from a growth opportunity globally we still see tremendous growth within the run specialty channel in the us were currently number six according to npd in the run specialty channel we could still double the business in that channel and just crack number five or four in the brands that are in that channel today so thats where we continue to be focused the key is maintaining credibility and authenticity in that run specialty channel but really increasing awareness before we start contemplating more selfservice environments and as i said the growth opportunity in europe is uk and germany and then japan and china in addition to driving as much business as we can through our own ecommerce channel erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co thank you guys all the best david powers  deckers outdoor corp thanks thomas a george  deckers outdoor corp thanks operator our next question comes from the line of omar saad with evercore please proceed with your question omar saad  evercore group llc thanks thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask actually about the pull forward a little bit thats kind of having the strange effect on the revenue for this past quarter and the next one its a little bit counterintuitive as we keep hearing from retailers wanting to push deliveries out closer to need maybe you could talk a little bit about what drove the pull forward is it one of the new accounts or is it something going on with an existing account david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah its a combination really of two drivers the first is a lot of that inventory was pulled forward by distributors they picked up early at port and a lot of those planned receipts were on the cusp of june and july and so the inventory was there the distributors were able to pick it up early and they did and i think its still a lot of that inventory is still kind of in season its not necessarily fall product where i think youre still hearing about some of the pushouts so just the fact that we were ready to go and the accounts were willing and looking to take some of that early its more about inventory being on the cusp of july versus june about a quarter of that upside came from hoka which was driven by the eagerness to get the clifton  in to the marketplace for the july  weekend in north america and so fortunately we had a good transition from the clifton  the inventory was ready to go and the launch plans are ready to go so we allowed customers to pull that inventory in early so they could set up and sell over the july  weekend which is proving to be a smart move were getting – hearing good reports in the sellthrough and were seeing that also on our ecommerce channel and i think that could potentially lead to some upside for that brand in q but with regards to ugg its more budgets getting through the inventory they have and the normal course of business going into q and q omar saad  evercore group llc thanks dave and then on hoka which you were just mentioning how do we think about the marketing plan you mentioned the need to get the word out on the brand and what are you – are you piling in more dollars behind that is there a certain marketing approach brand awareness building approach that you guys are taking that could accelerate and then hit an inflection point at some point in the next couple quarters david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah great question because one of the key investments in our cost savings over the next three years is going to be hoka marketing we have the product obviously we have bestinclass product thats resonating with consumers we think we have the right creative to appeal to the core authentic hardcore runner but also the female consumer and the lifestyle consumer so the investment that were going to make is really in driving awareness through continued ontheground events having a presence there so we remain authentic and important in doing tryon sessions where we can heavy heavy focus on digital and segmented offering in reaching the consumers that with relevant product for how theyre going to use the product you wont see any tv or outofhome or things of that sort but its just a matter of ramping up and getting very targeted on the consumers that we think are appropriate for this brand and the product it is the heavier investment in marketing currently than the rest of the brands and well continue to invest in that brand even more so going forward particularly when the cost savings start hitting the bottom line in a more aggressive way omar saad  evercore group llc got it and then if i could squeeze one more question on ugg how do we think about the piece of the business now thats really driven by some of the innovations in the last few years things like the luxe and the slim and the classic ii are those big franchises in a big component of the overall ugg kind of qq sales volume and are there other updates on these types of platforms that could also be important this year thanks david powers  deckers outdoor corp yeah great question and we had a fantastic meeting the other day where we reviewed the entire classics offering and then we had a great conversation around how we start segmenting that now that weve reset the classics franchise we have extensions off the core into the slim and luxe and the street style now were focusing on where we can segment those styles and then where we can innovate off of those styles so youll see a little bit of that this fall if you remember last year we said the first priority was reset the classics franchise and then were going to focus on extending – on the extension beyond that in fashion but going forward youre going to see more iterations off of the slim and the luxe in repositioning those based off the segmentation strategy theyre all performing well theyre becoming a more significant part of the business were learning on – a lot about who is gravitating to each of those styles whether its a younger consumer or an older consumer the channels that they like to shop in but it is giving us a broader platform to build off of and as far as innovation coming this year well be launching the first ever waterproof classic into the channel this year into wholesale and retail and my instinct tells me that thats going to be a strong seller

deckers brands website tevacom an example of the original pair of teva sandals which featured a thong between the toes a pair of teva sport sandals geophysicist mark thatcher invented teva pronounced tehvah not teevah hebrew for natureטבע while working as a rafting guide in  he noticed the lack of proper shoes for river activities sneakers would become heavy when wet and would take days to dry and flipflops would slide off feet very easily thatcher added a nylon ankle strap to a traditional thongstyle sandal thus creating the first sports sandal thatcher patented his invention and signed a deal with the shoemaker california pacific to manufacture the shoes while he marketed the amphibious utility sandals as their salesman selling  pairs the first year although it was effective water sports footwear it proved less effective for regular sports as the first teva users often complained of blisters between the first and second toes caused by the thongstyle strapping system however in  a sudden high demand of teva sandals arose as young americans found the sandal highly fashionable california pacific then claimed rights over the teva name and patent stating that thatcher was merely an employee of their company thatcher sued california pacific and won his case the following year severing links with california pacific he then originated the tevas company in flagstaff arizona in late  thatcher set up an exclusive licensing agreement with deckers corporation to manufacture and distribute teva sandals deckers eventually obtained exclusive rights to teva including patent  for the basic design and a trademark for the brand name the sandal was redesigned creating the universal strapping system the first model called hurricane is the basis of all teva sandalscitation needed on

parts the toe post a strap that goes on the frontal part of the sandal across the toes and between the inner and outer sole the heel strap goes around the ankle to prevent the sandal from sliding off

sheepskin upper with a wool inner lining and a tanned outer surface worn by men and women surfing helped popularise the boots outside of australia and new zealand when surfer brian smith started selling the boots in the us through ugg holdings inc in  ugg classic boots have been identified as a fashion trend since the early s in the united states with celebrities such as kate hudson and sarah jessica parker wearing them impact of the ugg brand on performanceedit deckers is considered a niche market supplier due to the dominance of the brand boots a high fashion luxury item in its sales and as such the company is more reliant than traditional clothing manufacturers on its products remaining fashionable in the economic downturn of  deckers continued to show solid earnings and sales growth in  ugg boots were deckers primary source of revenue accounting for  of net sales and  of the companys revenue in  deckers raised prices on its ugg boots to cover the rising cost of materials however the resulting decline in sales volume over the first half of  led to a price reduction which successfully stimulated sales ugg boots accounted for  of the companys revenue with some analysts expressing concern that ugg was losing its appeal while  annual revenue remained approximately the same as in the prior year profit was down  from  and share prices dropped  trademark disputeedit main article ugg boots trademark disputes ugg is a registered trademark in the us europe and many other countries there have been various disputes within australia europe and the united states about the validity of ughugg trademark deckers trades as ugg holdings inc in australia where it is known for a trademark dispute over the use of the widely used term ugg bootssometimes called uggs in  australian surfer shane steadman began selling ugg boots and registered the name ughboots as a trademark in australia in  brian smith another australian surfer brought several pairs of australianmade sheepskin boots to the us and began selling them in new york and california he set up ugg holdings inc and in  registered a us trademark on a rams head logo with the words original ugg boot ugg australia he later acquired the australian mark from steadman in  he sold his interest to deckers outdoor corporation in  deckers registered a trademark for ugg in the us in  deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent cease and desist letters to australian manufacturers but did not press the issue beyond that in  the validity of the ugg trademark was challenged in federal court in california the court ruled for deckers stating that consumers in the united states consider ugg to be a brand name in his final order the judge hearing the case stated that although the defendants had provided anecdotal evidence of the term being used generically deckers had countered this by submitted  declarations from four footwear industry professionals each of whom states that ugg is widely recognized in the industry as a brandname and not a generic term and that the defendants evidence fails to demonstrate that the term ugg is generic in his finding the judge did not consider whether or not ugg was a generic term in australia or new zealand as the doctrine of foreign equivalents only relates to nonenglish speaking countries a similar challenge was also rejected by a dutch court it was only in the early s when demand for ugg boots was soaring partly as a result of several celebrity endorsements of the ugg brand and australian manufacturers began selling uggs over the internet that deckers law firm middletons of melbourne began a serious effort to halt australian companies from using the word ugg in their salesefforts in  deckers sent cease and desist letters to  australian manufacturers and mortels sheepskin factory was prevented from selling uggs on ebay or from using the word in domain names in response to these actions by deckers australian manufacturers formed the ugg boot footwear association to fight the corporations claim arguing that ugg is a generic term referring to flatheeled pullon sheepskin boots they further argued that australian manufacturers had been making and trading this style of boot for decades including in the us in  bruce and bronwyn mcdougall owners of uggsnrugs a western australiabased manufacturer started legal action alleging that deckers had not actively used the ughboot registration in australian commerce for the past three years their action was successful in  and the ughboot registration was removed from the australian trademark registry the officer who heard the case stated that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms ugg ugh and ug boots are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods the ruling only applies in australia with deckers still owning the trademarks in all other jurisdictions including the us china japan and the european union counterfeit productsedit deckers has also been challenged by the marketing of counterfeit products principally from china according to the glasgow evening times in july  gangs of criminals have flooded glasgow with fake footwear  authorities across the west of scotland have seized hundreds of pairs of the musthave footwear  neil coltart at glasgow city council said these boots come in boxes that look like the real thing with tags and labels but the product clearly isnt the quality youd expecty from ugg  out of their slick packaging the boots were clearly not made of uggs comfy sheepskin but a cheap manmade fur one even had its distinctive ugg trademark glued onto its heel upside down holding up a pair coltart said i think most people would be pretty disappointed if they bought ugg boots and brought these home in  us customs agents confiscated  pairs of fake ugg boots and the company took action against  websites that were selling fraudulent products as well as some  listings on ebay craigslist and similar sites leah evertburks director of brand protection for deckers told the new york times the consumer is blind as to the source of the product  counterfeit web sites go up pretty easily and counterfeiters will copy our stock photos the text of our web site so it will look and feel like the deckers website sanukedit

flipflops would slide off feet very easily thatcher added a nylon ankle strap to a traditional thongstyle sandal thus creating the first sports sandal thatcher patented his invention and signed a deal with the shoemaker california pacific to manufacture the shoes while he marketed the amphibious utility sandals as their salesman selling  pairs the first year although it was effective water sports footwear it proved less effective for regular sports as the first teva users often complained of blisters between the first and second toes caused by the thongstyle strapping system however in  a sudden high demand of teva sandals arose as young americans found the sandal highly fashionable california pacific then claimed rights over the teva name and patent stating that thatcher was merely an employee of their company thatcher sued california pacific and won his case the following year severing links with california pacific he then originated the tevas company in flagstaff arizona in late  thatcher set up an exclusive licensing agreement with deckers corporation to manufacture and distribute teva sandals deckers eventually obtained exclusive rights to teva including patent  for the

sheepskin upper with a wool inner lining and a tanned outer surface worn by men and women surfing helped popularise the boots outside of australia and new zealand when surfer brian smith started selling the boots in the us through ugg holdings inc in  ugg classic boots have been identified as a fashion trend since the early s in the united states with celebrities such as kate hudson and sarah jessica parker wearing them impact of the ugg brand on performanceedit deckers is considered a niche market supplier due to the dominance of the brand boots a high fashion luxury item in its sales and as such the company is more reliant than traditional clothing manufacturers on its products remaining fashionable in the economic downturn of  deckers continued to show solid earnings and sales growth in  ugg boots were deckers primary source of revenue accounting for  of net sales and  of the companys revenue in  deckers raised prices on its ugg boots to cover the rising cost of materials however the resulting decline in sales volume over the first half of  led to a price reduction which successfully stimulated sales ugg boots accounted for  of the companys revenue with some analysts expressing concern that ugg was losing its appeal while  annual revenue remained approximately the same as in the prior year profit was down  from  and share prices dropped  trademark disputeedit main article ugg boots trademark disputes ugg is a registered trademark in the us europe and many other countries there have been various disputes within australia europe and the united states about the validity of ughugg trademark deckers trades as ugg holdings inc in australia where it is known for a trademark dispute over the use of the widely used term ugg bootssometimes called uggs in  australian surfer shane steadman began selling ugg boots and registered the name ughboots as a trademark in australia in  brian smith another australian surfer brought several pairs of australianmade sheepskin boots to the us and began selling them in new york and california he set up ugg holdings inc and in  registered a us trademark on a rams head logo with the words original ugg boot ugg australia he later acquired the australian mark from steadman in  he sold his interest to deckers outdoor corporation in  deckers registered a trademark for ugg in the us in  deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent cease and desist letters to australian manufacturers but did not press the issue beyond that in  the validity of the ugg trademark was challenged in federal court in california the court ruled for deckers stating that consumers in the united states consider ugg to be a brand name in his final order the judge hearing the case stated that although the defendants had provided anecdotal evidence of the term being used generically deckers had countered this by submitted  declarations from four footwear industry professionals each of whom states that ugg is widely recognized in the industry as a brandname and not a generic term and that the defendants evidence fails to demonstrate that the term ugg is generic in his finding the judge did not consider whether or not ugg was a generic term in australia or new zealand as the doctrine of foreign equivalents only relates to nonenglish speaking countries a similar challenge was also rejected by a dutch court it was only in the early s when demand for ugg boots was soaring partly as a result of several celebrity endorsements of the ugg brand and australian manufacturers began selling uggs over the internet that deckers law firm middletons of melbourne began a serious effort to halt australian companies from using the word ugg in their salesefforts in  deckers sent cease and desist letters to  australian manufacturers and mortels sheepskin factory was prevented from selling uggs on ebay or from using the word in domain names in response to these actions by deckers australian manufacturers formed the ugg boot footwear association to fight the corporations claim arguing that ugg is a generic term referring to flatheeled pullon sheepskin boots they further argued that australian manufacturers had been making and trading this style of boot for decades including in the us in  bruce and bronwyn mcdougall owners of uggsnrugs a western australiabased manufacturer started legal action alleging that deckers had not actively used the ughboot registration in australian commerce for the past three years their action was successful in  and the ughboot registration was removed from the australian trademark registry the officer who heard the case stated that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms ugg ugh and ug boots are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods the ruling only applies in australia with deckers still owning the trademarks in all other jurisdictions including the us china japan and the european union counterfeit productsedit deckers has also been challenged by the marketing of counterfeit products principally from china according to the glasgow evening times in july  gangs of criminals have flooded glasgow with fake footwear  authorities across the west of scotland have seized hundreds of pairs of the musthave footwear  neil coltart at glasgow city council said these boots come in boxes that look like the real thing with tags and labels but the product clearly isnt the quality youd expecty from ugg  out of their slick packaging the boots were clearly not made of uggs comfy sheepskin but a cheap manmade fur one even had its distinctive ugg trademark glued onto its heel upside down holding up a pair coltart said i think most people would be pretty disappointed if they bought ugg boots and brought these home in  us customs agents confiscated  pairs of fake ugg boots and the company took action against  websites that were selling fraudulent products as well as some  listings on ebay craigslist and similar sites leah evertburks director of brand protection for deckers told the new york times the consumer is blind as to

traditional clothing manufacturers on its products remaining fashionable in the economic downturn of  deckers continued to show solid earnings and sales growth in  ugg boots were deckers primary source of revenue accounting for  of net sales and  of the companys revenue in  deckers raised prices on its ugg boots to cover the rising cost of materials however the resulting decline in sales volume over the first half of  led to a price reduction which successfully stimulated sales ugg boots accounted for  of the companys revenue with some analysts expressing concern that ugg was losing

ugg is a registered trademark in the us europe and many other countries there have been various disputes within australia europe and the united states about the validity of ughugg trademark deckers trades as ugg holdings inc in australia where it is known for a trademark dispute over the use of the widely used term ugg bootssometimes called uggs in  australian surfer shane steadman began selling ugg boots and registered the name ughboots as a trademark in australia in  brian smith another australian surfer brought several pairs of australianmade sheepskin boots to the us and began selling them in new york and california he set up ugg holdings inc and in  registered a us trademark on a rams head logo with the words original ugg boot ugg australia he later acquired the australian mark from steadman in  he sold his interest to deckers outdoor corporation in  deckers registered a trademark for ugg in the us in  deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent cease and desist letters to australian manufacturers but did not press the issue beyond that in  the validity of the ugg trademark was challenged in federal court in california the court ruled for deckers stating that consumers in the united states consider ugg to be a brand name in his final order the judge hearing the case stated that although the defendants had provided anecdotal evidence of the term being used generically deckers had countered this by submitted  declarations from four footwear industry professionals each of whom states that ugg is widely recognized in the industry as a brandname and not a generic term and that the defendants evidence fails to demonstrate that the term ugg is generic in his finding the judge did not consider whether or not ugg was a generic term in australia or new zealand as the doctrine of foreign equivalents only relates to nonenglish speaking countries a similar challenge was also rejected by a dutch court it was only in the early s when demand for ugg boots was soaring partly as a result of several celebrity endorsements of the ugg brand and australian manufacturers began selling uggs over the internet that deckers law firm middletons of melbourne began a serious effort to halt australian companies from using the word ugg in their salesefforts in  deckers sent cease and desist letters to  australian manufacturers and mortels sheepskin factory was prevented from selling uggs on ebay or from using the word in domain names in response to these actions by deckers australian manufacturers formed the ugg boot footwear association to fight the corporations claim arguing that ugg is a generic term referring to flatheeled pullon sheepskin boots they further argued that australian manufacturers had been making and trading this style of boot for decades including in the us in  bruce and bronwyn mcdougall owners of uggsnrugs a western australiabased manufacturer started legal action alleging that deckers had not actively used the ughboot

working as a rafting guide in  he noticed the lack of proper shoes for river activities sneakers would become heavy when wet and would take days to dry and flipflops would slide off feet very easily thatcher added a nylon ankle strap to a traditional thongstyle sandal thus creating the first sports sandal thatcher patented his invention and signed a deal with the shoemaker california pacific to manufacture the shoes while he marketed the amphibious utility sandals as their salesman selling  pairs the first year although it was effective water sports footwear it proved less effective for regular sports as the first teva users often complained of blisters between the first and second toes caused by the thongstyle strapping system however in  a sudden high demand of teva sandals arose as young americans found the sandal highly fashionable california pacific then claimed rights over the teva name and patent stating that thatcher was merely an employee of their company thatcher sued california pacific and won his case the following year severing links with california pacific he then originated the tevas company in flagstaff arizona in late  thatcher set up an exclusive licensing agreement with deckers corporation to manufacture and distribute teva sandals deckers eventually obtained exclusive rights to teva including patent  for the basic design and a trademark for the brand

tanned outer surface worn by men and women surfing helped popularise the boots outside of australia and new zealand when surfer brian smith started selling the boots in the us through ugg holdings inc in  ugg classic boots have been identified as a fashion trend since the early s in the united states with celebrities such as kate hudson and sarah jessica parker wearing them impact of the ugg brand on performanceedit deckers is considered a niche market supplier due to the dominance of the brand boots a high fashion luxury item in its sales and as such the company is more reliant than traditional clothing manufacturers on its products remaining fashionable in the economic downturn of  deckers continued to show solid earnings and sales growth in  ugg boots were deckers primary source of revenue accounting for  of net sales and  of the companys revenue in  deckers raised prices on its ugg boots to cover the rising cost of materials however the resulting decline in sales volume over the first half of  led to a price reduction which successfully stimulated sales ugg boots accounted for  of the companys revenue with some analysts expressing concern that ugg was losing its appeal while  annual revenue remained approximately the same as in the prior year profit was down  from  and share prices dropped  trademark disputeedit main article ugg boots trademark disputes ugg is a registered trademark in the us europe and many other countries there have been various disputes within australia europe and the united states about the validity of ughugg trademark deckers trades as ugg holdings inc in australia where it is known for a trademark dispute over the use of the widely used term ugg bootssometimes called uggs in  australian surfer shane steadman began selling ugg boots and registered the name ughboots as a trademark in australia in  brian smith another australian surfer brought several pairs of australianmade sheepskin boots to the us and began selling them in new york and california he set up ugg holdings inc and in  registered a us trademark on a rams head logo with the words original ugg boot ugg australia he later acquired the australian mark from steadman in  he sold his interest to deckers outdoor corporation in  deckers registered a trademark for ugg in the us in  deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent cease and desist letters to australian manufacturers but did not press the issue beyond that in  the validity of the ugg trademark was challenged in federal court in california the court ruled for deckers stating that consumers in the united states consider ugg to be a brand name in his final order the judge hearing the case stated that although the defendants had provided anecdotal evidence of the term being used generically deckers had countered this by submitted  declarations from four footwear industry professionals each of whom states that ugg is widely recognized in the industry as a brandname and not a generic term and that the defendants evidence fails to demonstrate that the term ugg is generic in his finding the judge did not consider whether or not ugg was a generic term in australia or new zealand as the doctrine of foreign equivalents only relates to nonenglish speaking countries a similar challenge was also rejected by a dutch court it was only in the early s when demand for ugg boots was soaring partly as a result of several celebrity endorsements of the ugg brand and australian manufacturers began selling uggs over the internet that deckers law firm middletons of melbourne began a serious effort to halt australian companies from using the word ugg in their salesefforts in  deckers sent cease and desist letters to  australian manufacturers and mortels sheepskin factory was prevented from selling uggs on ebay or from using the word in domain names in response to these actions by deckers australian manufacturers formed the ugg boot footwear association to fight the corporations claim arguing that ugg is a generic term referring to flatheeled pullon sheepskin boots they further argued that australian manufacturers had been making and trading this style of boot for decades including in the us in  bruce and bronwyn mcdougall owners of uggsnrugs a western australiabased manufacturer started legal action alleging that deckers had not actively used the ughboot registration in australian commerce for the past three years their action was successful in  and the ughboot registration was removed from the australian trademark registry the officer who heard the case stated that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms ugg ugh and ug boots are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods the ruling only applies in australia with deckers still owning the trademarks in all other jurisdictions including the us china japan and the european union counterfeit productsedit deckers has also been challenged by the marketing of counterfeit products principally from china according to the glasgow evening times in july  gangs of criminals have flooded glasgow with fake footwear  authorities across the west of scotland have seized hundreds of pairs of the musthave footwear  neil coltart at glasgow city council said these boots come in boxes that look like the real thing with tags and labels but the product clearly isnt the quality youd expecty from ugg  out of their slick packaging the boots were clearly not made of uggs comfy sheepskin but a cheap manmade fur one even had its distinctive ugg trademark glued onto its heel upside down holding up a pair coltart said i think most people would be pretty disappointed if they bought ugg boots and brought these home in  us customs agents confiscated  pairs of fake ugg boots and the company took action against  websites that were selling fraudulent products as well as some  listings on ebay craigslist and similar sites leah evertburks director of brand protection for deckers told the new york times the consumer is blind as to the source of the product  counterfeit web sites go up
