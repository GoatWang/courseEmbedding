the viability of collective bargaining at the local level as a means for determining wages and working conditions of public school teachers because of its economic structure and administration legal aspects labor market and teacher organizations the environment of public education was regarded as unique for the development of collective bargaining six common features of collective bargaining were found to be particularly related to public educationexclusive recognition appropriate bargaining unit joint decisionmaking bargaining power scope of bargaining and the written agreement these six features were studied with respect to  reasons for development of the feature in the private sector  functional appropriateness in public education  current utilization in public education and  degree

article excerpt when we think of the state of the world economy over the last  years what we see is a mixture of the good the bad and the puzzling on the one hand we in the us have experienced the longest period of uninterrupted growth in our history weve actually had an extraordinary year run interrupted only by the rather short recession of  on the other hand this period has also been characterized by financial turmoil worldwide this period has seen the greatest concentration of financial crises since the s in the us the cost of resolving the savings and loan crisis amounted to around  percent of our gross domestic product gdp  yet this cost was dwarfed by crises in scandinavia latin america and most recently east asia estimates of resolution costs for the asian crisis countries are between  percent and  percent of gdp  and there are still rumblings of concern in certain markets for example the japanese banking system is generally regarded as undercapitalized with official reported bad loans amounting to over  percent of total loans the true volume of bad loans may be quite a bit higher  most observers would agree that financial disruptions of these magnitudes have substantial welfare costs  id like to focus on a particular manifestation of this problem the socalled twincrisis phenomenon where banking crises go handinhand with currency crises in emerging economies we saw this in mexico in  in east asia in  and in russia in  this new development is part of a broader phenomenon that creates both opportunities and dangers the rapid globalization of financial markets this explosion in crossborder financial transactions resulted from a confluence of economic political and technological factors the rapid exportled growth of developing free market economies notably the asian tigers especially by comparison to the relative lackluster performance of many statecontrolled economies has dramatized the potential gains from decentralization deregulation and reduction in restrictions on free movement of goods and capital technological developments have increased the ease and speed with which large volume crossborder transactions can be executed the great opportunity from globalization is that standards of living worldwide can grow as more and more countries exploit the gains from trade and as capital flows to its most productive uses the great danger is that globalization may carry with it new sources of financial instability and may exacerbate financial disruptions when they do occur so ive briefly discussed the good and the badnow the puzzle how should we respond to these challenges this issue is of particular concern to the federal reserve system the longrun goal of the federal reserve is to promote maximum sustainable growth through price stability however the federal reserve is also committed to safeguarding the safety and soundness of the financial system the approaches we have used in the past are designed mainly for national financial systems now i believe is the appropriate time to consider whether these approaches are adequate in an environment where national borders are less and less important in light of recent developments how should we proceed a good place to start is with a discussion of the twincrisis phenomenon where a banking crisis and a currency crisis occur simultaneously and feed on each other perhaps the most dramatic example of this phenomenon is the asian crisis of  what happened why did these countries get hit by a sudden crisis so strong that it engendered output declines on the order of the great depression  first lets rule out one candidate explanation the crisis was not the result of poor macroeconomic policies in fact the crisis countries pursued rather conservative policies their economies were characterized by low inflation budgets generally in surplus and declining government foreign debt … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this
