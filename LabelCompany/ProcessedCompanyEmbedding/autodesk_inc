ruled in vernors favor holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale nonrecurring price right to perpetual possession of copy it was in fact a sale with restrictions on use giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the firstsale doctrine as such autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against vernor who sought to resell used versions of its software on ebay the decision was appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit which reversed the lower court ruling denying vernor the right to resale

denied autodesks initial motion to dismiss in early  in february and march  both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the first sale doctrine applies to previously licensed software the court ruled in vernors favor holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale nonrecurring price right to perpetual possession of copy it was in fact a sale with restrictions on use giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the firstsale doctrine as such autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against vernor who sought to resell used versions of its software on ebay the decision was appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit which reversed the lower court ruling denying vernor

will generate more consistent revenueautodesks is showing more promising sales performance in emerging market its new subscription model will also guarantee more profit by reducing chance of licence piratingautodesks existing product line will help it win the competition in emerging area such as vr and photogrammatryby yingjing lu xinhui guo zichen liu and xingjian yu company overview autodesk nasdaqadsk is a company that makes software for the architecture engineering construction manufacturing media and entertainment industries in  autodesk had over  employees and generated  billion revenue with  net income autodesk has three collections of software products architecture engineering and construction product design media and entertainment each collection has multiple software products architecture engineering and construction collection includes products such as revit autocad infraworks  product design collection includes inventor professional and others media and entertainment collection includes for example maya and ds max autodesks products are widely used in industries major industryleading companies such as airbus disney deploy autodesks products in their business in february  autodesk announced the transition from perpetual licensing to payasyougo subscription plans under perpetual licensing users pay onetime upfront fee to purchase legal license to the software under subscription plans users pay for licensing of monthly quarterly annual or multiyear term lengths depending on users needs subscription plans allow users to have the most uptodate software without paying extra for updates under the subscription plan users can also take advantage of the autodesk cloud service that allows them to access software and files from any device they choose to use in addition to providing payment and location flexibility subscription plans prevent unlicensed usage of software better than perpetual licensing the consequential financial benefits of this change of licensing model will be discussed further in later sections autodesk has huge growth potentials virtual reality has been a growing trend in technology and autodesk having its visual dimensional design software will be able to capture large percentage of the market share we shall also consider the potential sales growth in industrial software there has been rapid growth in property construction and public infrastructure in developing countries such as china and india autodesks construction and engineering software will be widely used in those countries to design buildings and transportation systems the longterm construction growth in developing countries is great opportunity for autodesk to generate sales revenue for the next decades the key of autodesks success is whether autodesk will be able to capture the profits from sales of software products in the developing countries licensing laws in such countries are incomplete and loosely executed many companies may use unlicensed software which do not generate revenue for autodesk however as we mentioned before the new subscription plan model can largely prevent unlicensed usage of software we believe autodesks software will be widely used in developing regions and generated increased sales revenue the risk of autodesks future is whether it will be able to maintain its lead in the quicklychanging and highly competitive software industry although autodesk currently has significant advantage the fast pace of new software development and mergeracquisitions among existing companies and products can change the competitive landscape in a few years many leaders in the software industries have lost their advantages in a short period of time however we see autodesks strong initiative and commitment to stay ahead in the competition to maintain its advantages and to advance further with its current physical and intellectual assets and its commitment to continuing research and development we think autodesk will advance faster than its competitors and widen the lead financial analysis income statement from yahoo finance gross profit had a  drop from m to m at the first

competitive analysis autocad and its related product line serving artitecture manufacturing and construction industries has been the flagship and most profitable product line compared to its competitors autocad is more affordable easy to learn and competently functional according to forbes autodesk has achieved more than  market share in major areas in europe and america with its cad product line in  the stable market share has made autocad series an universal industrial standard which greatly improves user fidelity architecture engineering and construction product line autocad autocad lt autodesk inventor autodesk revit autodesk vault autodesk fusion  competitors ansys ansys is a company that provides solutions for cad and simulation for construction and manufacturing however ansys puts more emphasis on its simulation algorithm instead of its cad part on the other hand autodesk puts more emphasis on the ease of use of cad drawing process as a result many professional users usually use autocad to brainstorm and to draw the models and them import their model into ansys to run simulation in this most commonly used scenario ansyss and autodesks product line are identified as complements than direct competing substitutes bentley  aveva systems the above two companies are both identified as competitors in the manufacturing cad area with autodesk compared with autodesk those two companies are focus more on the users in highly sophisticated industries such as aero plane design ship design and energy plant design as a result they usually deliver more integrated solutions from design software to simulation to visualization for example avevas solution for chemical engineer industries delivers cad software for the design of the plant thermodynamic simulation of plant stress test and visualization of plant operation the holistic solution that those companies deliver make the two competitors occupies a lot of market shares in those industries where they are targeting at but at the same time because their solutions are really focused the pricing of their product is unaffordable for middle scale and small scale design companies even in large industrial design institutions autocad is still the competent one to accomplish regular design work as a result autodesks product line is more competitive in occupying the mainstream industries and market share media and entertainment product line autodesk maya autodesk ds max autodesk motion builder autodesk mudbox in the media and entertain d software market autodesk maya and autodesk ds max are unquestionably dominating products in those market both of those software delivers fast and easy workflow for animators and modelers through third party collaborators such asvray iray and lighthouse autodesks software can deliver more realistic simulation and more efficient rendering flow which is one of the most important part for animation industries to optimize their workflow also most peripheral products such as game engines and motion tracking software all natively support models created from maya and ds max furthermore autodesk works closely with hardware developers such as nvidia and amd to make sure their newest hardware acceleration features such as amd opencl and nvidia cuda can optimize autodesk products all of those aspects make autodesk me software the fastest most widely used and most compatible software in the mainstream market competitors cinema d is considered as a substitute product for autodesk maya but not as powerful as maya both of these products provides modeling animating and rendering features however cinema d is not optimized for hardware acceleration as a result cinema d right now is only limited in small scale animation production furthermore cinema d does not have a great community of developers to provide motion tracking support and real time rendering such as iray another example is zbrush which can be a great complement for autodesk ds max in the rapid modeling field zbrush provide more intuitive brushing interface that allows creators to sculpt models in a faster way however ds max is stronger in rendering textures as a result modelers usually use zbrush to create models and put them into ds max for rendering as a result the two competing software can work as complement to each others weakness and thus make their competition in the market less intrusive emerging area ar vr d printing photogrammetry product line autodesk maya autodesk ds max autodesk remake autodesk recap autodesk d catch autodesk compared with other startup companies have more competitive advantage in the emerging areas such as vr ar d printing and photogrammetry for vr and ar development autodesks maya and ds max are already the industrial standard for development most of the vr and ar engines such as unityd vuforia and cry engine have innate support to autodesks interface in terms of d printing and photogrammetry autodesks dominating cad product line and its rapidly developing new products d catch remake and recap are competitively powerful tools for current workflow in those areas even though there are more new companies such as d systems rhino and d flow provide more affordable options we still think that autodesk with its already wellrounded design product ecosystem and its industry standard that results in its dominating market share will be the flagship in the emerging market as well investment theme the major investment theme of going long for autodesk is that we regard autodesk as the leading cad software company and as its business model changed from licensing to subscription it will face a short term drawback which is the situation right now but will gain more sustainable growth in the future advantages of subscription model more consistent cash flow the returning users will offer autodesk consistent revenue every month after they complete their subscription payment the more stable cash flow will offer autodesk more predictable revenue to manage its capital and to make its spending more efficiently optimized under predictable revenue more affordable to larger user group the subscription will result in much less short term cost to use the software this is especially friendly for small scale companies which are not able to purchase multiple copies of thousands dollars software the subscription will be more widely accepted by those users and thus further expand autodesks market share less risk of piracy as the software is subscription based the software will renew its licence every time user go online this means that for those who pirate the software have to renew their fake licence every time they use it further the subscription will make software more accessible to the anti piracy updates autodesk releases the subscription will make piracy of the software less feasible and thus guarantee more revenue to autodesk we regard this crucial as autodesk is rapidly expanding to emerging markets where piracy is prevalent the subscription will help to guarantee more return from piracy in those regions easier to expanding cloud services because of the subscription users can install copies of software into multiple devices at home or at the office it will be more natural for users to complete their work at one place and sync it to other devices when they log in to their subscriptions on other devices enterprise license subscription also allows cloud file sharing across multiple users making online collaboration through autodesk cloud more crucial to the design teams in this way the cloud service autodesk  will be easily accepted by the users and thus will be another crucial source of income in the future as user fidelity become firm autodesks current stock price drop mainly results from its change of business model as its major cad software switch from one time licensing to subscription autodesk is facing the issue of lack of subscribers and the short term defer of its revenue lack of subscribers is the current issue that autodesk is facing from the graph one can observe that autodesks revenue peaks at mid  and dramatically decreased after mid  we interpret the trend as a result of its switching to subscription model autodesk receives nearly constant revenue before  because if its stable sales performance however after it first announced the plan for subscription during mid  more perspective users crowded to buy one time licence which result in its growth from mid  to  after the mania of licence starts to discharge the future users who autodesk foresees going to buy its subscriptions already has life long license as a result autodesk receives less initial subscribers and did not get stable revenue after switching the short term deferral of its revenue is because of the nature of subscription which is the payment of the licence will be spread out and result in less one time revenue within a quarter traditionally when a user is buying the software one time he or she will have to pay more than thousand dollars at one time to gain the licence these one time payments offers huge revenue and cash flow for the autodesk when it comes to subscription users only pays half hundred a month as a result with the price of the software spread out the short term revenue is diluted our counter argument for lack of subscribers is that autodesk is gaining a subscription growth autodesk reports that there are  subscription growth during q of  compared with other quarters and the subscription growth is getting stronger in the first quarter of  even though autodesk projects the revenue loss contributed by subscription is not expecting to recover due to the promotional discount of the subscription it is highly expectable for future strong revenue growth after gaining a huge amount of subscribers the deferred revenue due to the nature of subscription will also be compensated in the long run furthermore the advantage of subscription brings more steady monthly income and less possibility for pirating a comparable example is adobe both adobe and autodesk are software companies which dominate its field as adobe switched its model from one time licensing to subscription during mid  one can see similar trend of short term revenue losses in the graph however after adobes subscribers increases its gains huge improvement of revenue afterwards and we project autodesk will have similar success as adobe evaluation and projected growth the way we model autodesks projected growth is by comparing its predecessor adobe the graph shows the stock price of the two companies in the five year period the two triangles mark the time two companies switch to their subscription model as they are today as claimed in the previous part adobe is comparable with autodesk in its company profile side because both of these companies are industrial standard professional software developer they all have market dominating products adobes creative cloud product line vs autodesks engineering and manufacturing product line further both of those companies switched their business model from lifetime licensing to subscription from the graph in the technical side both of those companies stock price experienced drop during the switch period and then recovered as adobe projected about  times growth after switching to subscription in yearperiod we offer a relatively similar projection of autodesks growth of about  times achieving projected price of  per share counting for dividends in  years as autodesks current price stays around  per share we can still expect  growth in three years investment summary highlights we recommend to take a long position of autodesk for a  year period for about  growth the major theme of the investment is that autodesk is the leading software developer in cad and media entertainment area with its industrial standard software as autodesk have just changed its operation business model to subscription licensing from lifetime licensing of its major products this new model will offer autodesk more consistent long term revenue and will secure its growth in the
