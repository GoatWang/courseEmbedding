httpwwwrobertcraigwinecom perched  feet above the valley floor on the summit ridge of howell mountain robert craig winery produces small lots of superb cabernet sauvignon from some of napa’s top mountain vineyards bob craig’s interest in the unique nature of mountaingrown fruit took hold in  when he was involved in the creation of both the spring mountain district and mount veeder avas with this fascination driving him he founded his eponymous winery in  releasing the first vintage in  the early wines were made by bob egelhoff in a style that showcased the sturdy nature of the howell mountain fruit according to ceo and partner elton stone the wines then went through a stylistic change as egelhoff tried to tame their natural tannic structure he pushed ripening by picking late and employed various winemaking processes to create a riper more seamless style of wine stone who describes himself as having an “old world” palate decided to reverse all that his goals were twofold  for the wine to better express its unique terroir and  to make a very ageworthy wine he did so by moving harvest dates back up looking to pick at  brix rather than  as egelhoff had done and by working to improve the vineyard changing to cane pruning and revamping the winery equipment the work in the vineyard is key but expensive stone notes “it costs us almost  per year to farm the howell mountain vineyard all for an average yield of about  tons per acre” that’s in comparison to  per acre for the gently sloping  acres they own in southern napa on the slopes of mount george recently a neighboring property was added to the original acre vineyard surrounding the winery bringing their total holdings on howell mountain to more than  acres  of which are planted the estate wines are made from both the howell mountain vineyards as well as their  acres on the slopes of mount george winemaker stephen tebb also produces a mountain cabernet from crowley vineyard on spring mountain a mount veeder cabernet from a single vineyard at about  feet a chardonnay from gap’s crown in the sonoma coast and a howell mountain zinfandel from black sears vineyard just down the lane from the winery

documented varietals within the species vitis vinifera regarded as the true wine grapes the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine but wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown for example vineyards in new world growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from old world growing regions even when the wines are made from the exact same grape

full story napa valley is the most famous winegrowing area in the us it begins at the base of mount st helena in the north and tapers off some  miles to the south into the floodplain where the napa river enters san francisco bay from mount st helena to the city of napa the valley is defined by two northsouth ridgelines of the coast range mountains the bulk of grape growing for napa wines takes place on the valley floor and on the gentle slopes adjoining the floor the bestknown example probably being the oakville grade the floor ranges from less than a mile in width in the north to about  to  miles across in the south the hills to the west of the valley floor are part of the mayacamas range they contain key appellations such as mount veeder spring mountain and diamond mountain district with the exception of howell mountain the hills on the eastern side of the valley are not nearly as important or as well known from its earliest days napa valley has been the home of some of californias most famous wine estates today the valley boasts upward of  acres planted to napa wine grapes and some  wineries most of which offer highcaliber often expensive napa valley wines with some notable exceptions the best california chardonnays cabernets and merlots come from napa these varieties make up twothirds of the vines in the region because of its huge size napa valley is home to varied microclimates that support many different kinds of wine grapes for example the cool carneros region by san francisco bay yields good chardonnay and pinot noir and at the other end of the valley the warmer calistoga area can produce perfectly ripe zinfandel petite sirah and monster cabernets but it usually overcooks pinot noir and other heatsensitive varieties on wine labels the term napa valley has included all but the most outlying and inhospitable lands of napa county browse toprated wines from napa valley about california get the full story it is remarkable that an industry essentially less than a halfcentury old could capture the attention of the american winebuying public to the degree that california has powerful consumer interest in california wine is driven by two major factors the more obvious reason is that californias best wines which come from grapes grown in a benign climate featuring endless sunshine very warm summer days and generally dry harvests and wonderfully fruity full and satisfying and rarely too austere or tannic to be enjoyed from day one california is blessed with an extraordinary range of soils and microclimates allowing for the successful cultivation of many varieties in at least three out of four years the best sites produce healthy ripe fruits that are the envy of european producers in more marginal climates the other reason americans buy so much california wine is that california is the home team clearly a high percentage of domestic wine drinkers are more comfortable buying american wines and not just wines of california than imports then too foreign bottles are generally identified by place name rather than by the more familiar varieties that american wine drinkers have come to know and enjoy moreover in much of north america outside the top  or  largest metropolitan markets consumers have limited access to imported wines even if they wanted to buy them for many napa valley is california wine and cabernet is king in napa valley meanwhile the burgundy varieties chardonnay and pinot noir have gravitated to cooler areas generally closer to the pacific such as the western stretches of sonoma county the anderson valley in mendocino county and the santa maria and santa ynez valleys within santa barbara county syrah vines have yielded interesting wines in a range of styles all over the state in regions as disparate as mendocino county the sonoma coast carneros paso robles and santa maria valley very good zinfandel similarly comes from multiple growing areas although to date the ageofvines variable has been almost as important as geography zinfandel though its roots are in europe is a true california original and the only california wine imitated abroad its also a variety of which there are still significant plantings of very old vines in some cases dating back to the end of the th century browse toprated wines from california view less close napa valley top varietals cabernet
