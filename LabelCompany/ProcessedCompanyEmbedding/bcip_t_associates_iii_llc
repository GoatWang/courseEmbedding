wendy s plotkin choate hall  stewart llp boston ma for defendant robert j feldman opinion and orderin december  in a sponsored management buyout transaction a corporation sold a subsidiary business that operated a chain of toy stores   it received in exchange  million in cash and a deeply subordinated  million payinkind note due in    in  the new owners refinanced the business and distributed approximately  million to the buyout sponsor certain of its affiliates two officers and directors of the subsidiary who invested in the buyout and others   in  the toy business filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter  of the us bankruptcy codeas the holder of the  million note the selling corporation is the largest unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding   purporting to assert direct claims arising out of both the  sale and  refinancing the seller brings this action asserting claims based on a variety of legal theories including breach of fiduciary duties fraud and civil conspiracy   the complaint seeks recovery for the amount due on the note and restitution for the alleged unjust enrichment of certain of the individual defendantsin this opinion the court concludes that it must grant the defendants motions to dismiss   in sum most of the plaintiffs claims are barred as a matter of law because they are derivative in nature not direct and thus belong to the bankruptcy estate   in more general terms the underlying infirmity of the complaint is that the unavoidable effect of granting relief would be to unfairly advantage the plaintiff an unsecured creditor over any number of other unsecured creditors having claims in the bankruptcy   simply put this case stands for the wellestablished proposition that derivative claims cannot be used by a single creditor to upset the structured bankruptcy process   that principle equally applies when a plaintiff has erroneously characterized various derivative claims as direct in the hope of escaping the broad jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and the proceedings thereinia the partiesthe plaintiff in this case is big lots inc a ohio corporation with its principal place of business in columbus ohio until december  through its wholly owned subsidiary kb consolidated inc big lots owned and operated more than  retail toy stores across the united states puerto rico and guam under the names kb toys kb toy works and kb toy outlet   in addition kb consolidated conducted online sales of childrens products under the name kbkidscomthe complaint identifies three discrete sets of defendants   first big lots seeks recovery against michael l glazer a longtime manager and executive of the kb toys companies   at all relevant times glazer was a director of havens corners corporation “hcc” and kb holdings now kb toys inc as well as a chief executive officer of various of the kb companies including hcc and kb holdings  additionally glazer was a director of big lots at all times through may   second big lots brings claims against robert j feldman who during the challenged events was a manager and executive of the kb toys companies   further feldman was at all relevant times a director of hcc and kb holdings as well as chief financial officer of various of the kb companies including hcc and kb holdingsfinally the complaint sets out certain allegations against a group of individuals and entities affiliated with bain capital llc together known in this opinion as the bain defendants a private equity investment firm  the bain director defendants include joshua beckenstein matthew levin and robert white who are alleged in some combination to have constituted the board of directors of kb holdings the ultimate parent of hcc and its affiliates b the factsduring  big lots received various indications of interest or offers for the kb toys businesses including an offer from one of its own directors glazer to purchase kb toys in a leveraged buyout transaction   glazer ultimately withdrew his offer   but in december  big lots entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell kb consolidated and its operating subsidiaries to the bain defendants glazer feldman and other members of their management group   the transactional structure of this deal is complex but is briefly summarized below the  sale of the kb toys businesses to bain capitalbefore  the kb toys businesses were wholly owned by big lots then known as consohdated stores inc   the kb toys structure at that point consisted of a holding company called kb consolidated which was directly owned by consolidated stores and various operating companies positioned as subsidiaries of kb consolidatedthe sale of kb consolidated to the defendants took the form of a complicated multistep transaction   first big lots formed hcc to which it transferred  of kb consolidateds stock in exchange for all of the stock of hcc   this left the entire kb toys structure described above as a subsidiary of hcc   the defendants created kb holdings and its wholly owned subsidiary kb acquisition corporation   the parties then consummated the transaction by transferring all of the stock of hcc to kb acquisition for  million in cash and a  million payinkind note issued by hcc and due in december  the “pik note”at the conclusion of all related transactions kb holdings owned hcc which held all the stock of kb consolidated which in turn wholly owned the various subsidiaries that operated the kb toys businesses   in essence the pik note became the obligation of a company hcc with no assets other than the stock of another holding company   from its inception and by its terms therefore the pik note was subordinated to the rights and claims of creditors of the operating companies held by kb consolidated in any chapter  proceeding  the  transactionon april   kb toys undertook a series of transactions which included the redemption and repurchase of shares of the kb toys businesses the restructuring of equity and the payment of bonuses to more than  managers and senior executives of the kb companies  briefly kb toys was able to do this by causing the operating subsidiaries to raise debt part of which was paid immediately to executives as bonuses   the remaining additional funds were paid upstream to hcc and then eventually to kb holdings at the top of the corporate structure   kb holdings then used these funds to repurchase  of its own outstanding stock from the bain defendants glazer feldman and other kb insiders   however the parties characterize these events the fundamental purpose is clearthe  transaction constituted a liquidity event which allowed bain and its affiliates as private equity investors to withdraw certain sums of money from the kb toys businessesbig lots had no contractual rights in any capacity to block the  transaction  nonetheless on april   feldman wrote to charles haubiel general counsel of big lots certifying that following the repurchase agreement which constituted part of the  transaction kb holdings would continue to have a consolidated net worth of “not less than ”   the complaint alleges that the purpose of this certification although not required for any reason was to induce big lots to “generally cooperate with and not object to or seek legal relief with respect to the  transaction”   the kb toys bankruptcythe complaint goes on to allege that the  transaction left hcc and the operating subsidiaries on the brink of bankruptcy insolvent and unable to pay their obligations as they matured   in the words of the complaintthe effect of the  transaction was to encumber substantially all of hccs assets and to strip all of the value from hcc and the operating subsidiaries   the  transaction resulted in an enormous and unjustified return on the defendants investment in excess of ․  in a mere  months and ultimately resulted in hccs default on big lots  million hcc note although it is conceded that kb toys survived through the entire holiday season of  and then the entirety of  the complaint alleges that the  transaction led directly to a chapter  bankruptcy filing on january   some  months after the  transaction   as a result of the bankruptcy the pik note became due and payable in the amount of approximately  million consisting of  million in principal plus accrued interest iithe amended complaint originally set out nine counts alleged against various of the defendants   count vi a claim of unjust enrichment against the bain defendants glazer and feldman has now been voluntarily dismissed   as to those counts still at issue count j alleges that the bain defendants and the bain director defendants committed fraud by making false representations in the  stock purchase agreement and in various personal representations immediately thereafter   count ii alleges that feldmans representation on or about april   certifying that kb holdings would have a consolidated net worth of not less than  million was false and that all the defendants committed fraud by allowing big lots to rely to its detriment on feldmans representation in acquiescing to the  transaction which purportedly resulted in kb holdings being rendered insolvent   count iii alleges that glazer and feldman as directors of hcc and various hcc subsidiaries acquired fiduciary duties to big lots as a result of hccs insolvency and breached those duties by approving the  transaction   count iv makes similar allegations against the bain director defendants   count v alleges that the bain defendants and the bain director defendants aided and abetted glazers and feldmans breaches of fiduciary duty as alleged in count iii count vii alleges that glazer breached his fiduciary duties under ohio law as a director of big lots in failing to inform big lots of hccs pending insolvency as a result of the  and  transactions   count viii alleges that the  transaction by rendering hccs performance of its obligations under the pik note impossible constituted tortious interference with contractual relations   finally count ix alleges that all the defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy when they agreed and conspired with each other to commit the acts alleged in counts i through viiithe defendants move to dismiss the amended complaint on a number of grounds  first the defendants claim that counts ii through ix are derivative and belong to the bankruptcy estate   therefore they argue big lots has no standing to bring those claims   second the defendants claim that counts i and ii are barred by the statute of limitations   third the defendants maintain that all counts fail to state a proper claim for relief   finally the defendants raise a number of miscellaneous challenges to the complaint arguing that count i should independently be dismissed because it is contradicted by the stock purchase agreement on which it is based and that count ii fails to allege causationthe plaintiff argues that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to survive the defendants motions to dismissiiiin order to dismiss a claim under court of chancery rule b a court “must determine with reasonable certainty that under any set of facts that could be proven to support the claims asserted the plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief”   a court must accept as true all well pleaded factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from those facts   but a court need not “blindly accept as true all allegations nor must it draw all inferences from them in plaintiffs favor unless they are reasonable inferences”  a derivative and direct claimsthe defendants primary defense to counts ii iii iv v vii viii and ix is that under delaware law those counts set out derivative claims belonging to the bankruptcy estate and that big lots lacks standing to advance these claims   specifically the defendants argue the common element to these counts is that the fundamental injury alleged is the insolvency of hcc and that this insolvency injured big lots   thus they argue under the relevant delaware precedent these claims must all be derivative   the court agrees with the defendants as to counts iii iv v viii and ix   however the court finds count vii to set out a direct claim and dismisses count ii on other grounds count iicount ii alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced big lots to refrain from interfering in the  transaction by issuing the april   feldman letter assuring big lots that kb holdings would continue to have a consolidated net worth of above  million after that transaction closed   although the court notes that under the relevant precedent similar claims have been found to be derivative and would therefore be barred under the facts in this case the court dismisses count ii on the alternative ground that it fails to state a cognizable legal claim as a threshold matter the plaintiff is correct to note that in the bankruptcy context some courts have permitted individual creditors to maintain direct actions for fraudulent inducement even when those claims in some way implicate injury to the corporation   in brs associates v dansker for example the court was faced with a fraudulent inducement claim by a creditor against a defendant in bankruptcy   addressing itself to the difference between derivative claims and direct claims the court ruled that certain rico claims with regard to fraudulently induced investments were direct claims especially where the defendants misconduct concealed the fact that a loan was in default  as the court wrote in that case this doctrine represented a “narrow exception” to the general rule that a shareholder lacks standing to bring an individual action under rico to redress injuries to the corporation in which he owns stock  similarly in in re granite partners the court held that a complaint alleging that the plaintiffs were fraudulently induced to invest in a company was a direct claim even when the plaintiffs had also made allegations such as corporate waste mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty that the court dismissed as plainly derivative the fraudulent inducement claim in that case was not premised on the corporations eventual bankruptcythe bankruptcy cases in other words hold that claims somewhat akin to those brought here in count i can be brought directly   but the bankruptcy cases also make clear that fraudulent inducement claims where the only alleged injury is inextricably linked to a corporate injury are derivative claims   in in re swallens inc for example the court dismissed as derivative a claim by a creditor that the failure to maintain a sufficient collateral base led to the debtors failure to repay certain debentures  and in in re worldcom the court held that the shareholders claim that they were fraudulently induced not to sell their shares was derivative because they had failed to allege any distinct injury to themselves  the main dividing line between direct and derivative claims styled as “fraudulent inducement” therefore has been whether the plaintiff has alleged some injury other than that to the corporation   as such these cases are entirely consistent with the delaware supreme courts recent reformulation of the law on direct versus derivative claims in tooley v donaldson lufkin  jenrette inc  strictly speaking a claim for fraudulent inducement in the context of a credit agreement usually requires that the plaintiff be fraudulently induced to extend credit   on occasion however plaintiffs have raised a substantially different claim under the same rubric  namely that they were fraudulently induced to refrain from acting to collect their debt   courts have been extremely reluctant to grant relief in those casesin the admittedly early case of evans v burson the supreme court of oklahoma refused to grant relief where a seller claimed to have eschewed filing suit against a debtor on the basis of potentially fraudulent representations by the clerk overseeing a public sale   the court observed that the reason it dismissed the claim was that the “damages sought to be recovered are too remote and contingent to admit of a judgment at law therefor”   the plaintiff might never have had an action  the suit might never have been brought  the court might have decided that the action did not belong to the plaintiff as the evans court noted the plaintiffs possible recovery depended on “numberless unknown contingencies and can be nothing more than conjecture”  the oklahoma supreme courts decision in evans has been recognized as the general rule by more recent case law as well as by treatise authority  other courts while not citing evans have identified the wildly contingent nature of the requested recovery as a bar to this kind of fraudulent inducement claim  on those occasions where evans has been distinguished furthermore it has been distinguished on the basis of case specific facts   in ogorman v haber for example the court allowed a fraudulent inducement claim for inaction where “the plaintiff intended to attach and thus secure payment and had the right to attach” noting that the plaintiff in that case actively “gave up this right in reliance upon the defendants false representation․”   the facts alleged in the instant complaint set out precisely the kind of “fraudulent inducement” claim that courts have historically rejected   the gravamen of count ii is that big lots was injured because it refrained from bringing suit to stop the  transaction as a result of a purportedly fraudulent misrepresentation by glazer a third party to the debt between big lots and hcc nevertheless the complaint presents no facts to suggest that the plaintiff had any sort of legal right against the defendants or that it gave up any legal right in reliance on the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation   in addition big lots does not allege any basis in the pik note or the warrants on which it could have objected to the  transaction   further there is no reason to believe that big lots ever contemplated suit or that it had even a colorable claim against the defendants at the time of the  transaction   with the benefit of hindsight big lots now claims it could have taken “affirmative action” to block the transaction   but the complaint does not plead any contemporaneous facts suggesting that this was so   thus the court will dismiss count ii for failure to adequately allege a claim of fraudulent inducement  counts iii iv v viii and ixthe defendants argue that counts iii iv v viii and ix based on allegations of fraud and violations of fiduciary duty in approving the  transaction are derivative claims and therefore must be dismissed for lack of standing   big lots responds that in the context of this case the allegations in these counts set forth direct claims for which it has standing outside the bankruptcy estate any analysis of these claims must start with tooley the delaware supreme courts foundational opinion on the distinction between direct and derivative claims  rejecting previous and sometimes contradictory reliance on the socalled “special injury” test which looked to see whether the plaintiff had alleged a “special injury in whatever form”  the supreme court refocused the relevant inquiry onto two broader prongsthe analysis must be based solely on the following questions  who suffered the alleged harmthe corporation or the suing stockholder individuallyand who would receive the benefit of the recovery or other remedy  a direct claim in other words is a claim on which the stockholder can prevail without showing an injury or breach of duty to the corporation and one in which no relief flows to the corporation since tooley was decided this court has been called upon to differentiate between direct and derivative claims  the most relevant of these posttooley opinions to the facts of this case is production resources group v nct group a suit brought by a creditor against a debtor seeking the appointment of a receiver under  del c §  and alleging that the defendants board and a nondirector officer committed various breaches of fiduciary duty  the production resources court rejected any bright line test for determining whether claims are derivative or direct when brought by the creditor of an insolvent corporation   although the court recognized that most such claims are likely to be derivative claims under the standard in tooley the court acknowledged there might nonetheless be some circumstances in which “directors display such a marked degree of animus towards a particular creditor with a proven entitlement to payment that they expose themselves to a direct fiduciary duty claim by that creditor”  the unusual allegations of the plaintiff in production resources vividly illustrate how such animus could be pleaded   as the courts opinion sets out the plaintiff had obtained a judgment against the defendant for  million in  and had attempted to compel payment since that time   the facts alleged in the complaint established that the defendant had been insolvent for several years and yet had gone to extreme lengths both to avoid paying its judgment creditor and to misuse corporate power for the purpose of improperly benefiting itself and others in control  in the face of such extraordinary machinations the court was unwilling to dismiss the creditors claims of specific injury as derivative because it seemed possible that the creditor in question was the only one that had been injured and was thus the only one to which recovery was due   at the same time certain other claims were dismissed as derivative including conclusory accusations that “mismanagement and excessive salaries” had caused the company to become insolvent  big lots urges that the facts of this case mirror those of production resources noting similar allegations of insider payments in defiance of a “legitimate undisputed debt obligation” owed to it with knowledge that the  transaction would allegedly render hcc insolvent   however there are fundamental differences between this case and production resources a decision which relied heavily on its unique facts   as is clearly evident in production resources all the challenged transactions occurred in the context of an already insolvent company   in contrast the amended complaint in this case only attempts to allege that hcc became insolvent after and as a result of the  transactionadditionally the plaintiff in this case had no right to repayment of its debt at the time of the challenged transaction   unlike the judgment creditor plaintiff in production resources big lotss entire credit agreement with hcc consisted of the unsecured pik note due eight years after the  transaction was set to close   the immediacy of the production resources defendants debt was a necessary underpinning of the courts finding that the debtors recalcitrance might have been motivated by targeted animus towards the plaintiff  the pik note in this case sat in the distant future making big lotss argument that the defendants acted with the pik note in mind entirely incredible indeed the claims brought by big lots in this case if they resemble those in production resources at all resemble the claims that the court dismissed  shorn of excess verbiage big lotss fundamental complaint in the counts at issue here is that the defendants caused hcc to become insolvent through what amounted to breaches of fiduciary duty   as the court noted in production resources however “claims of this type are classically derivative”   they do not become direct simply because they are raised by a creditor who alleges that the breaches of fiduciary duty caused it specific harm by preventing it from recovering a debt outside of bankruptcythat result is directly in line with good corporate policy   as numerous commentators have observed creditors are usually better able to protect themselves than dispersed shareholders  there is no doubt that big lots was a sophisticated creditor which could have negotiated in the  sale for protections against later transactions   however the pik note is not alleged to contain any of the covenants and warranties that often bind debt contracts   given the facts as pleaded the absence of these otherwise standard provisions suggests strongly that the pik note was designed from the beginning to provide big lots some limited upside potential in the event that bain was able to turn the kb toys businesses into a profitable enterprise over the medium term   to imply further protections through fiduciary duty law would put the court in the awkward position of renegotiating a deal reached by extremely sophisticated and well represented parties to the clear detriment of the bankruptcy estate   that kind of ex post rationalization has rarely been the practice of the delaware judiciary and for good reasonbig lots also relies on what the court may loosely designate as merger cases to bolster its argument that its current allegations represent direct claims   specifically it relies on parnes v bally entertainment corp a case which held that a plaintiff that attacks the fairness of a merger alleges a direct injury rather than injury to the corporation  big lots argues that because the  transaction in this case was also allegedly “unfair” parties as reaffirmed by the delaware supreme court in tooley controls the result in this casebig lotss argument is based on a gross misreading of parnes   that decision did not establish that every allegation of unfairness in any transaction whatsoever raises a direct claim   rather the holding in parnes is necessarily premised on the fact that the challenged transaction was a merger in which the plaintiffs would lose standing to bring derivative claims and the misconduct at issue was intimately bound up with the merger itself   moreover the supreme court held the claims at issue in parnes to be direct because the purportedly unfair price paid to the shareholders in the merger did not injure the corporation in the way that mismanagement or improper selfdealing does   the facts are quite different here where the entire injury alleged by big lots flows from the fact that kb toys eventually became insolventin summary big lots has pleaded facts that could support a finding of injury to the corporation alone  under the test laid out in tooley therefore it is clear that the claims asserted in counts iii iv v viii and ix are entirely derivative in nature and cannot be maintained by big lots in this proceeding b count i the plaintiff alleges in count i that the bain defendants and the bain director defendants committed fraud in executing the stock purchase agreement for the  transaction on behalf of kb acquisition   this allegation is based purportedly on the text of section  of the stock purchase agreement that formed part of the  transaction which provides in pertinent part thatbuyer has received and delivered to seller a letter from fleet retail finance inc and fleet securities inc ․ with respect to debt financing ․ in an amount sufficient to fund the company dividend amount and to enable the buyer or its designee to pay the share purchase price and make any other payments to be made by buyer or its designee under this agreement or the transactions contemplated herebyaccording to big lots the italicized language above committed the defendants to ensuring that hcc would remain solvent and able to pay the pik note until it became due in    but big lots alleges the defendants never intended to honor the purported commitment set forth in section  and instead meant from the beginning to execute the  transaction and thus render hcc insolvent   therefore big lots claims the defendants fraudulently induced it to enter into the  transaction believing that its investment in the pik note was secure the plaintiffs argument entirely misconstrues section  of the stock purchase agreement   the plain language of this provision sets out nothing more than a guarantee that the buyer defined solely as kb acquisition corp had obtained a commitment letter from fleet that the commitment letter was for sufficient financing to meet the buyers obligations to close the stock purchase agreement and that the commitment letter remained in full force and effect as of the closing   nothing in this section imposes any obligation on hcc or even suggests that kb acquisition undertook therein to ensure the continued solvency of hcc for ten years into the future   indeed section s emphasis on the defined “share purchase price” which excludes the pik note rather than the “purchase price”  which includes that note makes this conclusion even more clear  in sum the only reasonable reading of section  is that it provides comfort to the seller that the buyer intends to close the transaction and that the buyers financial ability to do so will remain uncompromised   to turn that entirely standard promise into an allencompassing guarantee that kb acquisition and all its subsidiaries will continue to be solvent for ten years stretches the plain contractual language far beyond the breaking point   section  therefore is unambiguous and cannot be the basis of an allegation of fraud in the inducement against the defendantsc count viicount vii alleges that glazer violated his fiduciary duties to big lots as a big lots director on two separate occasions   first the plaintiff claims that glazer violated his fiduciary duty of loyalty by approving the  transaction while also serving as a big lots director and by failing to disclose to big lots the extent of his interest in that transaction   second the plaintiff claims that glazer violated his fiduciary duty of loyalty to big lots because he failed at the time the kb toys businesses were sold in  to disclose to big lots that the defendants intended to execute the  transaction and thus render hcc insolvent   big lots claims in essence that glazers failure to disclose caused big lots to approve the  transaction both parties agree that ohio law applies to glazers actions as a director of big lots an ohio corporation   fiduciary duty violations under ohio law are governed by statute requiring that a director perform his or her duties as a directorin good faith in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstancesadditional language in the statute provides that a breach of a duty as a director gives rise to an award of money damages only if clear and convincing evidence shows thatthe directors action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to the corporation or undertaken with reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation these two statutory provisions appear to establish a higher pleading standard for claims of monetary damages than claims for injunctive relief   indeed as an authority on ohio corporate law explainsapparently a director can be found by clear and convincing evidence to have acted in a manner she does not reasonably believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation ․ ie the director may be found to have breached his or her duties under rc § b and still not be held liable in damages for that action or inaction unless it is proved also by clear and convincing evidence that the director acted with deliberate intent to injure the corporation or with a “reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation” essentially therefore ohio law establishes that in cases seeking monetary damages a plaintiff can only succeed if it proves what in delaware would amount to a lack of good faith   from this statutory foundation ohio courts frequently refer to delaware case law and expertise in determining the contours of fiduciary duty  delaware courts have long held that a certain duty to disclose inheres in the duty of loyalty   as this court held in hoover industries v chase for example “the intentional failure or refusal of a director to disclose to the board a defalcation or scheme to defraud the corporation of which he has learned itself constitutes a wrong․”  but this duty to disclose is not a general duty to disclose everything the director knows about transactions in which the corporation is involved   rather the director disclosure cases decided in delaware courts have implicated circumstances in which the director is personally engaged in transactions harmful to the corporation but beneficial to the director  hollinger international v black  is the paradigmatic example of this claim   in that case the controlling shareholder and director failed to disclose that he was “shopping” the company in violation of a signed contract that forbade him to do so  the court held this failure to disclose to be a violation of the directors fiduciary duty   but even in that extreme circumstance the court was careful to note that the duty to disclose this information was based on the specific facts of the case which featured circumstances “under which ․ full disclosure was obviously expected”   under this standard count viis allegations concerning the  transaction fail to state a claim for relief   the simple fact is that the extent of glazers interest in that transaction in his capacities as an officer director or investor in kb toys was completely immaterial to big lots which had no right to approve or disapprove either the transaction or glazers participation in it   what was arguably material to big lots was the fact of the transaction and its size and there is no allegation that big lots was ignorant of those facts   nor can it be said that glazer violated some fiduciary duty owed to big lots under ohio law by approving the  transaction as a director of kb toys as his duties in that capacity ran entirely to kb toys count viis claim against glazer with respect to the  transaction is critically dependent on an allegation that glazer either knew or should have known that the defendants would execute the  transaction within some short time after the sale of the kb toys businesses and thus that glazer should have warned the other big lots directors of that fact   the court must grant the defendants motion to dismiss this claim because big lots has failed to sufficiently allege that glazer actually knew or actually had reason to know that the  transaction would happen   instead just as big lots would have the court infer that the proximity of the  transaction and the  bankruptcy means that the two are connected it insists that the proximity of the  and  transactions means that glazer knew or should have known in  that the  transaction was inevitable   much more than this effort to plead knowledge in the alternative is required where a plaintiff bases a claim on a directors duty to disclose a duty which our courts have only invoked in cases where the defendant had clear knowledge of the information at issue to hold otherwise here would expose participants in leveraged buyout transactions where directors or officers of the seller often emerge as directors and officers of the surviving corporation to subsequent litigation based on mere speculation that a defendant should have known of some transaction planned by the new company within a few years after the sale and that the transaction would turn out badly   that overly broad conception of liability is not what delaware courts meant in establishing that a directors fiduciary duty of loyalty includes the duty to disclose known facts to his fellow directors ivfor the foregoing reasons the defendants motions to dismiss are granted as to all counts   it is so orderedfootnotes   am compl ¶    id at ¶    claims have also been filed against various bain capital affiliates each of which is a private equity investment fund or other investment vehicle

fiduciary duty against glazer in his former capacity as a director of big lots is a paradigmatic ally direct claim brought by an aggrieved corporation big lots against one of its own directors   that count as discussed below is nonetheless dismissed for failure to state a claim   big lots cites two additional lines of authority for its argument that the claims it brings in this case are direct   both are inapposite   first big lots claims that nondisclosure claims are generally direct claims citing this courts decision in alex brown mgmt servs  wl  at   del ch lexis at    although the plaintiff is right to note that nondisclosure claims are direct claims where a defendant has “failed to disclose material information when they had a duty to disclose it” the complaint alleges no wellpleaded facts that establish the defendants had any duty to disclose their intention if any to conduct the  transaction when they signed the stock purchase agreement in    in the absence of a specific duty to disclose the plaintiff has only pleaded a set of derivative fiduciary duty claims   second big lots relies on cases based on the long established and common sense principle that the same set of facts can set out both direct and derivative claims seeking different forms of relief to suggest that the same is true in this case   see eg grimes v donald  ad   del   had big lots pleaded facts which establish a direct claim such as those in production resources both the bankruptcy estate and big lots could have brought claims arising out of the same facts   the complaint fails however to adequately plead such facts   scaggs aff ex a §    the court notes that by alleging that the defendants committed fraud by inducing big lots to enter into a transaction based on a false statement big lots has stated an unambiguously direct claim in the form suggested by production resources  ad at    the defendants do not dispute the plaintiffs standing to bring this claim   scaggs
