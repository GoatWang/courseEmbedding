prices rallymar  about energy fuels uuuu zoltan ban commodities macro gold  precious metals longshort equitysummaryfebruary was the third consecutive month of uranium price gains since november bottom not certain yet whether november was the actual bottom but we are most likely close based on dataenergy fuels has the potential to increase production by a large factor if uranium prices increase significantlyprofitability is a bit of an issueas i pointed out in an article i wrote a few months back i believe that we are either close to reaching a bottom in uranium prices or we might have even reached that point back in november  source index mundi i recognize the fact that the decadelong decline trend in uranium prices has seen similar shortterm reversals on numerous occasions only to once more reverse course and head down again as i pointed out already in a previous article earlier in the month where i announced that i started taking up a position in uranium starting with urenergy nysemkturg there seems to be a definite and sustained gap opening up between supply and demand which makes it imperative to start looking at uranium miners in my view for this article i decided to analyze energy fuels inc nysemktuuuu source miningcom as far as i can tell it seems that the odds of uranium having bottomed in november  or bottoming this year or next at the latest are very good i think there is an increasingly strong chance that the bottom was reached in november but even if not i do not see uranium prices going far below that level for very long we should keep in mind that uranium fuel consumers are also looking at charts like the one above and will therefore consider the current price environment more desirable for them compared with five or ten years from now it therefore makes sense to keep buying today or even increase purchases making it unlikely that we will revisit the november bottom a number of recent factors such as russia scrapping its weapons grade decommissioning agreement kazakhstan deciding to cut mined production by  and japan deciding to restart nuclear reactors are still in place in fact a court ruling announced just this week gave the green light for two reactors to come on line this means that the expected sale of existing nuclear fuel stockpiles in japan may not be sold off after all in fact even the whole germany completely scrapping its nuclear power capacity story may in the end turn out to be longterm misguided expectations as i pointed out in an article a few months back germany is starting to come to terms with the fact that it cannot simply cut its nuclear coal and natural gas power generation out of environmental convictions and replace it all with wind and solar it recently took steps to cut support for these renewable sources one source of concern is the fact that power generation capacity from these sources literally varies based on weather patterns on some days wind  solar may provide close to  of germanys electricity needs while on other days it may drop into singledigit territory replacing nuclear capacity with natural gas may not be desirable or viable either because gas production from the netherlands which in  accounted for about half of all eu domestic supply is collapsing while the alternative is to drastically increase imports from russia there is a new massive pipeline project in the works from russia to germany but it is likely to be a way to cut reliance on ukraine as a transit route and to make up for lost dutch production rather than supply the needed gas for the replacement of nuclear power in germany i personally believe that there will be some significant political push to delay or even reverse the decision to scrap all the nuclear reactors soon after this years federal elections because things simply dont add up urenergy is not the only stock i want to own in order to position for what i believe to be an emerging longterm investment opportunity i already covered cameco nyseccj denison nysemktdnn and uranium resources inc nasdaqurre i will most likely continue buying this year and next as part of a strategy to build up exposure to uranium in coming years i want to continue looking at the field of possible investment targets by analyzing energy fuels inc which offers its own unique qualities as a potential investment target for those who want to have longerterm uranium mining exposure the main thing we need to look at in regards to energy fuels is its profitability reserves and valuation in terms of profitability it recorded a loss of  million on revenue of  million this company clearly needs a significantly higher realized uranium price if it is to break even source energy fuels as we can see revenue declined compared with the previous three years but so did the size of the financial loss in  it produced over a million pounds of uranium and it sold a total of  million pounds for  it intends to sell  pounds unless prices increase or if need be raise some cash by selling on the spot market according to its latest presentation however it has licensing to produce as much as over  million pounds per year the maximum production ever reached was  million pound per year it is unclear how much energy fuels could or would produce at certain price thresholds but it can clearly increase production dramatically from this years projected levels as far as the reserve base it can produce from it is looking relatively good source energy fuels inc taking proven measured and half of indicated resources together we get  million pounds at this years production rate the reserve base would be sufficient for over  years we cannot expect production to remain at current levels however so a more realistic estimate would be about  years depending on future production choices in terms of company valuation the company currently trades at a market cap of just over  million canadian dollars or about  million assuming an average realized price of pound for its resources the future value of the uranium that is very likely to be extracted is about  billion subtracting the liabilities of  million and then adding  million in cash we get  billion based on the costs applicable to revenue data from the k we can assume that the cost of producing a pound of uranium was  in  this is based on the sale of  million pounds of uranium and costs of revenue of  million meaning that it would take about  billion to produce the reserves currently assumed to be recoverable subtracting the  billion from the  billion value of the reserves we get a net value of  billion versus a market cap of about  million a fair value of  is therefore what we are looking at meaning that this stock could be worth a potential market cap of about  billion by this measure this trading discount to the fair value based on its resources should not be seen as being unexpected because it would take this company moving towards profit at much higher revenue levels in order to start rising towards that market cap level as far as odds of reaching profitability comparing it with urenergy which i recently bought it is looking like the road to profitability will be much longer urenergy recorded a loss of  million on revenue of  million in other words the loss was about  of revenue while energy fuels recorded a loss of  million on revenue of  million meaning that the size of the loss was  of revenue two advantages i see for energy fuels is the fact that interest costs were  of revenue compared with  for urenergy as i pointed out on many previous occasions this is a measure i regard to be very important when analyzing resource extraction companies i generally do not like to see an interestrevenue ratio higher than  the other advantage is the sheer size of the resource base as well as the higher potential production capacity in this regard i do believe that if we were to see a very sharp increase in realized uranium prices energy fuels could during that price spike period outperform urenergy in terms of stock gains i do not believe that a sharp price spike in uranium is likely to happen any time however i think the gain in prices will be more of a healthy steady and moderate but sustainable variety energy fuels will most likely do well if the uranium market rebounds as i expect it will for the long term it will just take a long time to get to profitable uranium miner status which is an obvious downside compared with some peers note if you found this article to be useful and enjoyed reading it there is a follow

uranium producer  in  energy fuels was the second largest supplier of uranium within the united states and according to published company guidance energy fuels is expected to become the  uranium producer in the united states in   energy fuels also holds the largest inground uranium resource portfolio of any producer or nearproducer in the united states the united states the world’s leading producer of nuclear energy and uranium consumer currently obtains about  percent of its annual uranium requirements from foreign sources the nation is home to  commercial nuclear reactors with four more under construction energy fuels is the only uranium producer with both conventional production and in situ uranium recovery “isr” in the united states with the only conventional uranium mill operating in the country and a large portfolio of highquality conventional and isr uranium properties energy fuels is the leading uranium mining company in the us in terms of current production scalability and resource portfolio energy fuels offers excellent leverage to rising uranium prices and is well positioned to capitalize on the growing need for more domestic and global uranium supplies energy fuels’ response to lower prices has been to consolidate the us uranium space acquiring a  percent stake in highvalue assets while liquidating the company also continues to permit and develop its quality portfolio of lowcost producing and nearproducing uranium projects as uranium prices rise energy fuels plans to swiftly scale up production at its lowcost projects including its currentlyproducing nichols ranch isr project in wyoming its fullypermitted and constructed alta mesa isr project in texas its fullypermitted and nearly developed canyon mine in arizona and canyon mine ore and alternate feed materials at its white mesa mill in utah  the company also expects to earn additional revenues through toll processing production of other valuable minerals including vanadium and copper and other business opportunities at its white mesa mill  longerterm the company expects to produce uranium from largescale conventional projects including the fullypermitted sheep mountain project  wyoming the advancedstage  and roca honda project  new mexico and the bullfrog project utah  the company also has the potential to produce copper from its canyon mine in arizona and vanadium from several of its mines currently on standby in utah and colorado in a march  letter to shareholders energy fuels president and ceo stephen antony stated “while i can’t say whether the recent upward price move in uranium is the beginning of the ‘next uranium bull market’ i confidently believe there is considerable upside for proven producers of uranium with scalability and highquality assets like energy fuels”   investment highlights currently reducing production in the current lowprice environment in order to conserve cash and valuable inground resources thereby increasing leverage to improving uranium prices the white mesa mill the only conventional uranium mill operating in the united states over  million pounds of annual capacity located in utah the nichols ranch isr project existing isr production in wyoming licensed to significantly increase output  million pounds of annual capacity the alta mesa isr project significant existing isr production on standby in texas

fullypermitted the roca honda project advancedstage permitting and the bullfrog project prepermitting stage other conventional mines on standby that can resume production in improving markets  the la sal complex the daneros mine the whirlwind mine and the tony m mine    ongoing conventional uranium production the white mesa mill energy fuels’ white mesa mill is truly a strategic asset as it provides the company with a multitude of business opportunities including the production of uranium  the facility is the only fullylicensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the united states and one of only three in north america white mesa is strategically located in blanding utah central to the highestgrade uranium mines in the united states since  the mill has produced about six million pounds of uranium and it is expected to produce  pounds in  as the company cuts production in response to recent low prices it is also capable of producing a highpurity vanadium product and the company is evaluating the potential to recover copper  finally it is also ideally positioned to generate revenue through rd party toll milling processing lowcost alternate feed materials and participating in the cleanup of historic uranium mines in the region although the white mesa mill will only produce about  lbs in  it has a licensed capacity of over  million lbs of uo  per year ongoing in situ uranium production the nichols ranch isr project energy fuels owns and operates the nichols ranch isr project located in the prolific powder river basin of wyoming  energy fuels acquired this key production asset in  through its acquisition of uranerz energy corporation in  the company produced about  pounds of uranium at nichols ranch and in  the company expects to produce about  pounds of uo the company currently has  wellfields in operation with an additional  wellfields permitted for production as market conditions warrant ensuring a longterm production profile while today’s prices dictate reduced levels of production tthe facility has a licensed capacity of  million pounds of uranium per year   in situ uranium production on standby alta mesa isr project in june  energy fuels completed the acquisition of mesteña uranium and its flagship alta mesa isr project located in south texas alta mesa is a wellknown proven lowcost uranium producer within the u  s nuclear industry between  and  the facility produced about  million pounds of uranium including over  million pounds in two of those years the project is currently on care and maintenance as uranium prices rise above about the  per pound level on a sustained basis energy fuels expects to resume production at this important asset according to an august  ni  technical report alta mesa contains an estimated  million tons of measured and indicated mineral resources with an average grade of  percent containing  million lbs of uranium plus  million tons of inferred mineral resources with an average grade of  percent containing  million pounds of uranium in addition the technical report identified further areas for exploration with an average grade of  to  percent uo containing  to  million pounds of uranium  the total project area is over  acres providing the company with a longterm lowcost uranium production profile from this asset the nichols ranch isr project in wyoming the alta mesa isr project in texas and the white mesa mill in utah gives energy fuels diversified lowcost isr and conventional uranium production from three production centers the company has four uranium sales contracts extending to  with over a half million pounds of uo under contract in   energy fuels expects to deliver  pounds of uranium in the fiscalyear  under its existing contracts three of those contracts are at a significant premium to current spot prices a fourth will be priced based on the average spot price per pound of uranium five weeks prior to the delivery date acquiring nichols ranch and alta mesa deepened the value of energy fuels’ already impressive development pipeline which includes the largest ni  resource base among producers in the united states these isr acquisitions make the company the only integrated mining company with conventional and isr uranium production in the united states “energy fuels is clearly emerging as a leading integrated producer of uranium in the united states  we now have lowcost isr and conventional uranium production in our portfolio the largest ni  compliant inground uranium resource in the us among producers and the ability to significantly increase uranium production in the future as uranium prices rise” explained antony canyon mine in development canyon mine fullypermitted mine in development energy fuels towns the fullypermitted canyon mine in northern arizona  this is a very highgrade breccia pipe uranium mine within trucking distance of the company’s white mesa mill where the ore will be processed in the
