chinas factories in shenzhen can copy products at breakneck speed—and its time for the rest of the world to get over it — quartz obsessions our picks latest popular double trouble your brilliant kickstarter idea could be on sale in china before you’ve even finished funding it written by josh horwitz obsession shenzhen october   shenzhen chinas hardware manufacturing hub reutersbobby yip share written by josh horwitz obsession shenzhen october   shenzhen china yekutiel sherman couldn’t believe his eyes the israeli entrepreneur had spent one year designing the product that would make him rich—a smartphone case that unfolds into a selfie stick he had drawn up prototypes secured some minimal funds from his family and launched a crowdfunding campaign he even shot a professional promo video showing a couple taking the perfect selfie in front of the eiffel tower stikbox stikbox but one week after his product hit kickstarter in december  sherman was shocked to see it for sale on aliexpress—alibaba’s englishlanguage wholesale site vendors across china were selling identical smartphone case selfiesticks using the same design sherman came up with himself some of them were selling for as low as  a piece well below sherman’s expected retail price of £  amazingly some of these vendors stole the name of sherman’s product—stikbox sherman had become a victim of china’s lightningfast copycats before he had even found a factory to make his new product manufacturers in china had spied his idea online and beaten him to the punch when his kickstarter backers caught on they were furious “you are charging double the price for what the copycats are charging yet i seriously doubt the final product will be any better than the copycats” one person commented years ago experts in the hardware industry would have had more sympathy for sherman now no one does—not even sherman himself while discussions of intellectual property in china’s manufacturing centers once focused on how brands and investors could protect their designs from china’s rapacious copycats things have changed startups and foreign manufacturers are embracing a new reality—someone in china is going to make a knockoff of your unique invention almost immediately all any company or entrepreneur can do is prepare for it the origins of copycat culture china’s knockoffs come in many different forms and can affect businesses large and small in some cases factories will make products that physically resemble ones made by prominent brands quality may vary—an android phone with rounded edges and a stampedon apple logo will never come close to replicating the feel of an iphone but a counterfeit gucci bag might easily pass for the real thing sometimes as was the case with stikbox and the hoverboard a factory or design team will spot a fledgling new product on the internet figure out how it’s made and start churning out nearidentical products other times a chinese partner factory will produce extra units of a product they agreed to make for another company and sell the surplus items themselves online or to other vendors jack ma founder of alibaba drew criticism when he told investors in june paywall that fake goods “are of better quality and of better price than the real names” and come from “exactly the same factories” as authentic goods but there’s some truth to his comments fake goods “are of better quality and of better price than the real names” jack ma said   many analysts and historians have attributed chinese counterfeiting to perceived aspects of chinese culture like its emphasis on memorization in education or an authoritarian government that stifles innovation but rather than these reductions of culture it has more to do with the evolution of china’s gadget and electronics manufacturing hub of shenzhen explains silvia lindtner who researches chinese entrepreneurship culture at the university of michigan the city’s rise throughout the ’s and early ’s coincided with a boom in outsourcing among global multinational corporations instead of overseeing all the manufacturing of all the parts inside a product large global hardware companies signed contracts with local manufacturers in shenzhen to make and design products piecemeal these contractors would then turn to smaller subcontractors to help fill orders many of the factories involved in these fragmented supply chains were small familyowned entities operating without government approval as they worked together they realized they could do more than just supply parts that ended up in namebrand hardware they could create rival products on their own and reach customers who were too poor to buy a nokia phone or apple ipod said lindtner they banded together at times sharing the recipes for specific electronic devices on online message boards thus began the shanzhai phenomenon a word that literally means “mountain fortress” but came to stand for products that skirt existing intellectual property laws phones and consumer electronics with names like “apod” and “nokla” flooded the market in the late ’s a “emshanzhaiem” iphone lookalike tablet running likely a pirated version of windows software reutersbobby yip opensource manufacturing the shanzhai era in consumer electronics gradually faded as incomes rose and brandname smartphones became more affordable but it enforced a culture of knowledgesharing among manufacturers wherein no single product design is sacred lindtner compares the culture of shenzhen’s manufacturing ecosystem to the opensource movement among software developers much like how programmers will freely share code for others to improve upon shenzhen manufacturers now see hardware and product design as something that can be borrowed freely and altered success in business comes down to speed and execution not necessarily originality “it’s understood that reiterating or copying is part of the culture and whoever is better and faster is going to make the deal” said lindtner nowadays china’s copycat phenomenon extends well beyond multinational corporations like gucci or nokia—startups are affected too thanks to the internet factories and designers looking for the next hit product can easily turn to kickstarter amazon or taobao to see what gadgets are hot they message each other instantly using wechat china’s dominant chat app or alibaba’s chat software which makes sourcing and assembly line planning even easier than in the presmartphone days  factories turn to kickstarter amazon or taobao to see what’s hot   “the whole chinese system has developed around the idea that you have instantaneous communication and basically infinite information” said bunnie huang author of the essential guide to electronics in shenzhen “back in the ’s people were talking about ‘justin time’ manufacturing” as something to aspire to he said “but now the chinese don’t even know any other way” enforcement is impossible businesses can take certain legal precautions to reduce the risk of getting copied a first crucial step according to song zhu who litigates ip disputes between us and chinese firms at californiabased law firm ruyak cherian llp is to apply for utility and design patents for a product that’s valid in the us china and anywhere else one hopes to sell entrepreneurs should also sign “nnn agreements” with potential chinese partners before revealing any intellectual property this contract prevents partner factories from using the intellectual property themselves after first view “nonuse” sharing it with others “nondisclosure” or inking a partnership and then selling extra units on their own “noncircumvention” but even with these protections there’s no guarantee that you can stop someone from copycatting your product zhu said that the problem lies not in china’s courts but enforcing rulings winning a case against one factory is relatively easy but suing every factory and winning is expensive and time consuming  suing every factory and winning is expensive and time consuming  “there are probably hundreds of small factories who might see a product on the internet and think ‘hey i can do this” said zhu “how are you going to shut down all of them how can you even find out where they are and the money you spend suing them is more than you can get out of the lawsuit” this is now the position sherman finds himself in with stikbox while he hasn’t pursued legal action yet he said he spends  of his time tracking down copycat factories through china’s giant ecommerce sites it sometimes takes him up to five days to figure out one factory’s location “the copycat factory doesn’t show its address on alibaba only a trading company who represents them sometimes you have to track down two or three trading companies before you get to the actual factory” he told quartz your great idea doesn’t matter the spread of copycat manufacturing isn’t just creating headaches for hardware companies and startups it’s challenging traditional notions of intellectual property—specifically what type of ideas are valuable and what type of ideas are not decades ago a company or entrepreneur might come up with an idea and then spend years securing the patents completing the design devising a manufacturing plan and bringing it to market enforceable contracts with partners helped ensure these ideas wouldn’t leak to competitors—but so did the high cost of starting a factory sourcing components and managing assembly lines moving the world’s manufacturing center to china makes the latter hurdles nearly disappear factories are set up in makeshift buildings cheap labor is abundant sourcing components is easy because of online marketplaces like alibaba as a result smart ideas that are easy to turn into physical products become commoditized quickly businesses are now forced to come to terms with this new reality it’s not enough to create a product with a groundbreaking design or features like a smartphone case that turns into a selfie stick companies dealing in the creation of physical goods now must make products that are impossible to copy exactly from the get go by focusing on a special feature they can protect or creating a coveted brand name consumers will pay more for “if you have a simple product that has some market demand you will get copied” said benjamin joffe who works with hardware startups that are manufacturing in china at hax a venture capital fund “the question is more what do you actually have that’s defensible” what do you actually have that’s defensible  companies can defend themselves from copying by investing in software that complements physical hardware and then guarding it apple for example does this with the iphone which carries the proprietary ios operating system that’s unavailable on other phones or they can invest in wellcrafted branding and marketing gopro for example has made a name for itself among its target user base of sports and photography enthusiasts this can help insulate it from competition from korea’s lg xiaomi and small chinese knockoff factories sure there are plenty of fake gopros out there but some consumers will pay more for the real thing alternatively a company can make a product that requires sophisticated manufacturing knowhow so that the average factory wouldn’t bother trying to copy it hong kongbased startup native union for example created an earpiece for smartphones that looks like an oldfashioned crescentshaped landline phone receiver it was clever but got copied immediately founder igor duc later changed the company’s direction and began making a totally different product—smartphone cases made out of italian marble that sell for  each they’re more difficult to make than the average consumer electronic device which prevents copycats from surfacing “when you use complicated raw materials like marble you need to have a lot of expertise about what is good quality and you need to shave it with a very specific machine” said duc “whereas a plastic injection is easy to copy what we do now is more complex” the bright side of copycats joffe the venture capital investor argues that some companies might even benefit from copycatting as it can bring more awareness to the product itself “if you have more customers buying the fake product then it creates more awareness for the real product and it becomes an aspirational thing at some point they might be able to afford the real thing” this is what sherman reminds himself of as he scrambles to fulfil orders while his emptyhanded kickstarter backers ponder buying a fake from taobao instead “there are other selfie stick cases but we are the only ones that have been copied so it shows that our product is worth being copied” he said “the quote that comes to mind is ‘imitation is the sincerest form of flattery’” yet sherman estimates that he has lost “hundreds of thousands” of dollars in potential revenue due to copycats imitation isn’t just a sincere form of flattery it’s an expensive one as well most popular scientists just found another worrying link between sugar and depression

university school fl from 8 and am currently studying at rice university i was fairly active on the national circuit in my senior year i am open to pretty much any type of debate as long as its done well i debated progressively so enjoy judging that kind of debate but i wont reward any particular style of debate or any particular argument based on what kind of things i enjoyed doing the easiest way to win my ballot is to make smart arguments and good strategic decisions throughout the round though i will make my decision strictly off the flow it is important to clearly establish a standard to adjudicate the round speed and theory are both fine more specifically speed i am fine with speed as long as you are clear and reasonably loud i will say clear slow loud etc but if i have to interject more than once or twice it will likely be reflected in your speaks dont sacrifice clarity for the sake of speed you should enunciate sign post clearly and make it clear when one argument ends and the next begins please slow down significantly on analytics theory tags and author names framework be comparative when talking about advantages and disadvantages to your and your opponents frameworks dont just isolate the debate to two different sections of the flow narrow utilitarian standards such as minimizing terrorism rarely include justifications to exclude other relevant utilitarian impacts just because terrorism is bad doesnt mean that other things arent at least as bad it is not acceptable to provide a new framework in the ar if you failed to do so in the ac its not in your best interest to run afc theory it is important to slow down considerably on theory i prefer arguments about actual abuse to potential abuse and a fourpart shell to paragraph theory but i will vote on any of them if won i will default to viewing theory as an issue of reasonability you should avoid running timesuck theory though the question of whether or not a theory shell should be considered a time suck is obviously nebulous i generally find fairness to be a more effective voter than education i default to viewing theory as a reason to reject the argument not the debater when extending theory be sure to include the interpretation violation standards internal links and voters i will evaluate rvis like any other argument kscritical arguments im open to most arguments that being said i dont think im the best judge for critical debates these debates often include questionable links strangely established andor incomplete standards complicated philosophical literature with weird jargon and questionable coherency and cards cut from books or articles in which the author takes several hundred pages to warrant the conclusion that the card apparently justifies i am also not very familiar with critical literature if you have a sick kritik thats well justified and understandable feel free to run it if you run it well i will be as happy as i would be if you ran any argument well more or less i may even be impressed but please dont run ks to either a confuse your opponent or b confuse your judge and hope for them to rep out extensions extensions are super important be sure to extend the claim warrant and impact of your argument this doesnt have to take the form of rereading or including all the minutia of your original argument especially if the argument is conceded or if its the ar and youre really pressed for time with analytics especially if theyre only a couple lines it may be easiest just to basically reread the argument in your extension you should still explain the implication of the extension based on the particular round your extensions must demonstrate that you at least understand the necessary components of your own argument and should show that you understand your argument holistically the best way to do this and to win the round is by clearly explaining the inround implications of your arguments weighing weighing is also super important especially in util debates its impossible to evaluate a util debate without intervening if neither debater has weighed saying i outweigh on magnitude because i have a bigger impact though its better than not weighing at all is a terrible argument please be very comparative and explicit when you weigh new weighing is generally acceptable in the nr and ar if it doesnt contradict your own weighing done in a previous speech evidence comparison is also very useful miscellaneous i may call for important cards at the end of the round if the rhetoric or substance of the evidence is contested if i dont have a certain part of a card on my flow however and im fairly sure it wasnt read i will likely ignore it even if it is bolded underlined whatever so dont go overly fast speeding through cards and dont try to get away with clippingi have a pretty good understanding of permissibility and presumption and how the two interact running either of these arguments is acceptable on the current animal rights topic however i dont think arguments for why permissibility goes aff are particularly compellingyou probably shouldnt run disclosure theory unless you have some really cool new ways to justify it if youre just running fairly stock disclosure theory i probably wont vote for you and if i do you probably will get low speaks if at the end of the round theory is an issue of reasonability i cant imagine a circumstance in which i would vote for disclosure theoryi dont care if you sit or standfeel free to talk to me before the round if you have any questions about my paradigm or after the round if you have any questions about my decision javascript required you need to enable javascript in your browser to edit pages help on how to format text turn off getting
