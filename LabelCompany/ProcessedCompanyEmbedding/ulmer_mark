fighting for what is right and being an advocate for the rights of fathers in miami chantale is one of a kind and i continue to be very grateful she is on my sideidalis perez parobert t ratedi recommend idalis perezpedirle a la abogada idalis perez que represente a mis dos menores hijos en un complicado caso de ajuste de status es una de las mejores decisiones que he tomado en mi vida el caso de mis hijos tomó un giro inesperado y problemático una noche que oficiales de inmigración visitaron mi domicilio luego de esa visita quedé desmoralizado y casi sin esperanzas sinceramente me hacía de regreso en mi país con mis hijos antes de visitar a la abogada idalis perez me entrevisté con dos abogados mas honestamente no me convencieron a pesar de ser muy conocidos en el medio no me inspiraron confianza todo lo contrario sucedió al entrevistarme con idalis sobria en su análisis de la situación sincera al darme su opinión absolutamente entendida en las leyes de inmigración y los pasos a seguir idalis estableció una estrategia y esa estrategia nos llevó a un final feliz hoy mis hijos son residentes permanentes a lo largo del camino idalis nos nos mantuvo informados absolvió todas nuestras dudas siempre estuvo ahí para nosotros si hubieran  estrellas en vez de  para calificar su conocimiento de las leyes su trato humano  su honestidad y su disponibilidad para atender mis dudas o preocupaciones con gusto le daría  estrellas quiero hacer una mención muy especial al staff de idalis todos ellos se han portado maravillosamente con nosotros han sido eficientes atentos muy pero muy pacientes con un padre preocupado del futuro de sus hijos realmente son el equipo que toda persona que se enfrenta a un complicado caso de inmigración sueña tener hoy que hemos superado existosamente el complicado camino que la vida nos puso por delante quiero agradecer a idalis y su staff sin ellos no lo hubiéramos logrado y quiero que mi experiencia sirva a los que vienen detrás los casos de inmigración afectan las vidas de las personas al confiarle un caso de inmigración practicamente estamos confiando nuestro futuro al abogado que escojamos haberle confiado a idalis el caso de inmigración y por ende el futuro de mis hijos fue la mejor decisión que pude tomar una vez mas y no me cansaré de repetirlo gracias idalislaw offices of diane m trainornotredame ratedi went online to find the new office address for ms trainor and was shocked to read the reviews that were written they are so vindictive and so untrue that i feel that i have to take the time to address them they were clearly submitted by a disgruntled exspouses of one of ms trainors clients and in no way accurately reflect ms trainor her professionalism and high moral and professional standards to say that she would put a child at risk and allow pedophiles on the streets is disgusting and an abuse of the opportunities allowed by unchecked reviews it sounds as though somebody ended up on the losing end in court and is now striking out in the most miserable way possible the writers should be ashamed of themselves i was referred to ms trainor many years ago and have since referred others to her she is an incredibly compassionate fair intelligent lawyer who advocates aggressively on behalf of her clients but at the same time will tolerate nothing less than decency and truth from those whom she represents in my experience and from what i have heard she has never charged more than a fair fee and has never billed up a file to detail the alleged family background and to imply that ms trainor is complicit in any of the alleged actions in a professional review is ridiculous and puerile there have been no rulings nor sanctions against ms trainor and she has always been in good standing with the fl bar the reviewers who by the way seem to have been on a vengeance streak that day considering the multiple negative reviews against others has mischaracterized all info that he or she found as they pursued their vendetta i highly suggest contacting current or former clients of ms trainor i guarantee that they will offer only positive reviews and commentary on ms trainor shame on you reviewer you seem to be an angry unstable individuals who has lost control and needs more help than a public forum can offer idalis perez paphilippe g ratedi cant remember where i first saw idaliss name but i do remember her outstanding reviews convinced me and my husband to go with her as our counsel im very glad i did idalis and her team because its a team effort with a special shout out to idalmis her sister whos the the coo to her ceo got the process going kept it going took care of every little detail was very responsive to questions and concerns even if i asked like the same thing probably five times and kept checking in  immigration issues always carry some stress knowing they were there for us took a huge weight off our shoulders they werent perfect there were a couple of glitches most notably a form that didnt get filed as fast as it should of due to a teammembers medical issue that caused it to be overlooked for a few days but with the good communication back and forth once the problem was identified it was immediately expedited and taken care of to me seeing how a team handles a problem is a better indication of how good they are as opposed to when everything is running totally smoothly seeing them handle the problem so quickly and efficiently after recognizing it gave me more confidence that if something went wrong they would have it cleared up asap so if you want a warm and friendly and caring staff the second time i sat with idalmis she asked about my motherinlaws health which had been fragile at the time of initial meeting her concern was genuine and i was touched she remembered and asked me about it  luckily she was much better who is also experienced diligent and effective i absolutely recommend idalis perez and her excellent teamlaw offices of robert
