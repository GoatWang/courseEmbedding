environment with the revolutionary santilli telescope with concave lenses trade mark and patent pending by thunder energies thunder energies corporation has previously presented confirmations of the apparent existence of antimatter galaxies antimatter asteroids and antimatter cosmic rays detected in preceding tests in this breaking news thunder energies presents evidence for the existence of invisible terrestrial entities ite of the dark and bright type httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlfvztgwindexlistpldadztlmhmaelxzyvnnyvcwzxwrppamela fleming states the detection occurred at  pm using a pair of  mm galileo and santilli telescopes from the th floor of the marriott hotel facing the tax collector building in tallahassee florida no anomalous entities were detected with the galileo telescope with conventional convex lenses whereas the anomalous entities were fully visible in the screen of the digital camera attached to the santilli telescope with concave lenses i believe that these anomalous entities are a good candidate for invisible terrestrial entities of the second kind because they emitted isodual light which can only be focused with the santilli telescope with concave lens httpwwwthunderenergiescomindexphpctmenuitemarticlesarticlepamela fleming adds the entities disappeared from view in the santilli telescope two hours after the initial detection without any change in the public city lighting that was surrounding the tax collector building thunder energies corporation believes that this detection confirms the usefulness of the new surveillance of civilian industrial and governmental facilities permitted by our pair of galileo and santilli telescopes since they can record all possible anomalies not visible with conventional binoculars or telescopes
