begin laurans mendelson well thank you very much and good morning to everyone on the call we thank you for joining us and we welcome you to the heicos second quarter fiscal  earnings announcement teleconference im larry mendelson chairman and ceo of heico corporation and im joined here this morning by eric mendelson heicos copresident and president of heicos flight support group victor mendelson heicos copresident and president of heicos electronic technologies group and carlos macau our executive vice president and cfo before reviewing our record second quarter operating results in detail id like to take a few minutes to summarize the quarterly highlights consolidated second quarter and first six months of fiscal  net income operating income and net sales represent record results for heico driven principally by record net sales and operating income within both operating segments consolidated net income increased  to a record  million or  per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal  and that was up from  million or  per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal  consolidated net income increased  to a record  million or  per diluted share in the first six months of fiscal  and again that was up from  million or  per diluted share in the first six months of fiscal  our net debt which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents so net debt to ebitda ratio was a low x as of april  and that compared to x shortly after the acquisition of robertson fuel systems in january  robertson of course was the largest acquisition in heico history so im continued to be very pleased with heicos laser focus on strong cash flow generation as well as the consistency of our growth in net income the flight support group set an alltime quarterly net sales and operating income record in the second quarter of fiscal  by improving  and  respectively over the second quarter of fiscal  those increases principally reflect increased demand within the flight support group aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines as well as the benefit of operating efficiencies our etg group set an alltime quarterly net sales and operating income record in the second quarter of fiscal  by improving  and  respectively over the second quarter of fiscal  the increases principally reflect period over period net sales growth across the majority of etgs product offerings as well as the benefit of some operating efficiencies cash flow provided by operating activities remain strong totaling  million or about  of net income for the first six months of fiscal  keep in mind that we are projecting that for the full fiscal year  we expect cash flow provided by operating activities to approximate  of reported net income as of april   the companys total debt to shareholder equity ratio was  in addition our net debt to shareholders equity ratio was  as of april   with net debt again total debt less cash and cash equivalents total debt net debt of  million and that was principally incurred to fund acquisitions in fiscal  and  in april  our flight support group acquired  of the equity interest in air cost control a leading aviation electrical interconnect product distributor of such items as connectors wire cable protection and fastening systems in addition to distributing a wide range of electromechanical parts we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings within the current fiscal year in april  we increased the aggregate principal amount of our revolving credit facilities by  million or  reaching a total of  billion and that was through increased commitments from existing lenders we are very pleased to have such strong support and confidence from our lenders and our heicos financial strength coupled with our expanded funding capacity should allow us to continue to execute our strategic acquisition strategies and our goals in march   we declared a for stock split which reflects the board of directors continued confidence in the strategic trajectory and growth of the business the additional shares were distributed in april  all applicable share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect for this for stock split and for your interest the  this marks heicos  stock dividend or stock split since  id now like to introduce eric mendelson copresident of heico and president of heicos flight support group and he will discuss the results of the flight support group eric mendelson thank you the flight support group net sales increased  to a record  million in the second quarter of fiscal  up from  million in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased to a record  million in the first six months of fiscal  up from  million in the first six months of fiscal  the increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  mainly reflects organic growth of  and   and  respectively the organic growth in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  is principally attributed to increased demand and new product offerings within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines partially offset by lower sales within our specialty products  product lines the flight support groups operating income increased  to a record  million in the second quarter of fiscal  up from  million in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased  to a record  million in the first six months of fiscal  up from  million in the first six months of fiscal  the increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  is mainly attributed to the previously mentioned net sales growth and efficiencies realized from the benefit of our growth net sales on a relatively consistent period over period sga expenses the flight support groups operating margin increased to  in the second quarter of fiscal  up from  in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased  in the first six months of fiscal  up from  in the first six months of fiscal  the increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and efficiencies realized within sga expenses with respect to the remainder of fiscal  we now estimate mid to high singledigit growth in the flight support groups net sales over fiscal  level in the fullyear flight support group operating margin to approximate  to  we continue to estimate mid singledigit organic growth in full fiscal  net sales over fiscal  level these estimates include our recent acquisition of air cost control but exclude additional acquired businesses if any lastly id like to acknowledge our team which we consider to be the best in the industry for being recognized as the top   supplier by altas airlines alta is the latin american and caribbean air transport association and represents the airlines in that region heico was ranked number  out of over  suppliers evaluated this recognition is presented to industry suppliers that have demonstrated their dedication to the highest standards in categories such as customer support and documentation turnaround time and quality service and i can tell you that this does not come by accident our team worked extremely hard to make sure they satisfy our customers and keep them happy and id like to acknowledge our team and thank them for their outstanding service now id like to introduce victor mendelson copresident of heico and president of heicos electronic technologies group to discuss the results of the electronic technologies group victor mendelson thank you eric as i start the review with the etg businesses i would like to thank and recognize the etg team members who made our excellent results possible not only this quarter but over a long period of time and continue to endeavor mightily for us and for our customers and for each other every day the results we achieve arent the result of blueprints or equipments or buildings they come from hardworking dedicated team members who show up every day and do everything they can for our company so i thank you all for your hard work in sales the electronic technologies groups net sales increased  to a record  million in the second quarter of fiscal  up from  million in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased  to a record  million in the first six months of fiscal  up from  million in the first six months of fiscal  increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  reflects organic growth of  and  respectively the organic growth in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  resulted from increased demand in certain aerospace other electronics and medical products additionally the increase in the first six months of fiscal  reflects the contribution from our profitable fiscal  acquisition the electronic technologies groups operating income increased  to a record  million in the second quarter of fiscal  up from  million in the second quarter of fiscal  and increased  to a record  million in the first six months of fiscal  up from  million in the first six months of fiscal  the increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  came primarily from the previously mentioned net sales growth and efficiency realized from the benefit of our growth in net sales and relatively consistent period over period sga expenses further the increase in the first six months of fiscal  reflects a decrease in acquisition costs due to the first quarter of fiscal  reflecting  million in acquisition costs associated with prior year acquisition partially offset by higher performancebased compensation expense the electronic technologies groups operating margin improved to  in the second quarter of fiscal  up from  in the second quarter of fiscal  and improved to  in the first six months of fiscal  up from  in the first six months of fiscal  the increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal  principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and efficiencies realized within sga expenses with respect to the remainder of fiscal  we are continuing to estimate mid to high singledigit growth in the electronic technologies groups net sales over fiscal  levels principally reflecting organic growth and anticipate the fullyear electronic technologies groups operating margin to approximate  of course these estimates exclude additional acquired businesses if any i turn the conversation back over to larry mendelson thank you laurans mendelson thank you victor looking at diluted earnings per share consolidated net income per diluted share increased  to  in the second quarter of fiscal  and that was up from  in the second quarter of fiscal  and it increased  to  in the first six months of fiscal  again up from  in the first six months of fiscal  all fiscal  diluted eps amounts have been adjusted retrospectively for the for stock split which was distributed april  looking at rd the expense increased  to  million in the second quarter of fiscal  and that was up from  million in the second quarter of fiscal  it was an increase of  to  million in the first six months of fiscal  again up from  million in the first six months of fiscal  significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both flight support and etg as we continue to invest approximately  to  of each sales dollar into new product development as we’ve told you many times it is a basic driver of heico we constantly spend money on research and development to develop new products and improve the existing products that we sell and thats a basic strategy that we will never give up sga expense decreased to  million in the second quarter of fiscal  that was down from  million in the second quarter fiscal  and decreased  million in the first six months of fiscal  down from  million in the first six months of fiscal  the decrease in the second quarter fiscal  principally reflects a  million impact from foreign currency transaction adjustments on borrowings denominated in euros under our revolving credit facility and a  million impact from changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration associated with prior year acquisitions the decrease in the first six months of fiscal  principally reflects  million of acquisition costs recorded in the first six months of fiscal  associated with the fiscal  acquisition and a  million impact from current foreign currency transaction adjustments on borrowings denominated in euros under our revolving credit facility and partially offset by a  million increase in performancebased compensation expense consolidated sga expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to  in the second quarter of fiscal  and that was down significantly from the  in the second quarter of fiscal  and decreased to  in the first six months of fiscal  down again significantly from  in the first six months of fiscal  that decrease in consolidated sga expense as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal  principally reflects efficiencies realized from the benefit of our growth in net sales on relatively consistent period over period sga expense as well as the impact from the previously mentioned foreign currency transaction adjustments and changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of net sales in the first six months of fiscal  principally reflects the efficiencies realized from the benefit of our growth in net sales on relatively consistent period over period sga expenses as well as the impact from the previously mentioned decrease in acquisition costs interest expense was  million in the second quarter of fiscal  and that compared to  million in the second quarter of fiscal  and it was about  million in both the first six months of fiscal  and  other income was insignificant and i wont comment it income taxes our effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal  decreased to  from  in the second quarter of fiscal  and that decrease principally reflects the favorable impact of higher tax exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies related to the heico corporation leadership compensation plan our effective tax rate in the first six months of fiscal  decreased to  from  in the first six months of fiscal  the decrease principally reflects a discrete income tax benefit related to stock option exercises resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standards on sharebased payment transactions in the first quarter  and the favorable impact of higher tax exempt unrealized gains in cash surrender value of life insurance policies again related to the heico corporation leadership compensation plan the decreases were partially offset by the benefits recognized in the first quarter fiscal  from the retroactive and permanent extension of the us federal rd tax credit and that resulted in recognition of additional income tax credit for qualified rd activities related to the last  months of fiscal  net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was  million in both the second quarter of fiscal  and  and  million in the first six months of fiscal  compared to  million in the first six months of fiscal  for the fullyear  fiscal year  we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and noncontrolling interest rate of between  and  of pretax income and that assumes that the us corporate tax reform does not become effective during this fiscal year now moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow our financial position and our forecasted cash flow remain extremely strong as we previously discussed cash flow provided by operating activities totaled  million in the first six months of fiscal  representing  of net income and for the full fiscal year  we anticipate cash flow provided by operating activities to approximate  of net income and later on if  the people on the call want to ask carlos for the details of why it was only  as opposed to  it was because there were some payments that were  that came in the first six months and will not repeat in the second and we expect our cash flow again to be  of net income and very strong the working capital ratio improved to x as of april   that was up from x as of october   dsos days sales outstanding of receivables increased to  days as of april   and that was up from  days a year prior april   that was due to the quarter end acquisition of air cost control and the timing of receivable collections excluding the impact of this acquisition on dsos  the dsos wouldve been  days as of april   we closely monitor receivable collection efforts to limit credit exposure we have very little receivable writeoff losses and weve never had big ones no one customer accounted for more than  of net sales the top five customers represent approximately  and  of consolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal  and  respectively our inventory turnover rate increased to  days for the period ended april   as compared to  days for the period april   and that was due to the quarter end acquisition again of air cost control and if we exclude the impact of this acquisition the inventory turnover rate actually decreased to  days versus  for the first six months of fiscal  as previously mentioned our total debt to shareholders equity was  as of april   and our net debt to shareholders equity was  on april   with net debt again debt less cash and cash equivalents of  million and that was principally incurred to fund acquisitions in fiscal  and  we have no significant debt maturities until fiscal  and we plan to utilize our financial flexibility and strength to aggressively pursue high quality acquisition opportunities to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns i know i’m going to be asked this question in a few minutes so the pipeline for acquisition is very strong we can hardly keep up with it but we do such a thorough due diligence process that it really takes us a lot of time and we try to turn over all the stones and do an extremely thorough complete job but we have a very very full acquisition pipeline and all price within our normal guidelines for acquisition as we look ahead to the outlook for the remainder of fiscal  we do anticipate net sales growth in the flight support group and etg resulting from increased demand across the majority of our product lines during the remainder of fiscal  well continue our commitments to developing new products and services market penetration aggressive acquisition strategy while maintaining financial strength and flexibility based on our current economic visibility we are increasing our estimated consolidated fiscal  yearoveryear growth in net sales to  to  and in net income to  to  and both of those are up from prior growth estimates in net sales of  to  and net income of  to  in addition we now anticipate our consolidated operating margin to approximate  depreciation and amortization expense to approximate  million capex expenditures about  million cash flow from operations to approximate  million and thats up from the previous estimate of  million in cash flow from operations of course these estimates include our recent acquisition of air cost control but exclude additional acquired businesses if any in closing id like to thank all of heicos team members for another outstanding quarter of excellence in execution and financial results its because of their dedication and hard work that were able to deliver consistent high performance for our shareholders and as always we will continue to focus on intermediate and longterm growth strategy with an emphasis on acquiring profitable businesses and just one personal comment what doesnt appear in ks qs financial statements and presentation is the incredible capability of our team members these are the people that make these results possible these are the people that strive for growth of course we incentivize them with what we believe are great incentive plans but these are exceptionally talented people and we are very pleased and proud to be working with them because these are the ones that produce the results so thank you those are the  that’s the extent of our prepared comments and the floor is open for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from george godfrey with clk george godfrey thank you good morning gentlemen laurans mendelson good morning george godfrey just wanted to ask two questions the first one organic growth this quarter of  in mid single digits for the fullyear very solid but little bit of a downtick from q can you just comment on what youre seeing on the organic growth trends going from  in q down to  here in q eric mendelson you’re  george are you speaking about the fsg segment george godfrey yes if memory serves they were both  organic growth last quarter but i could be wrong on that eric mendelson i can tell you that if you look at the comps the comps got tougher in the second third fourth quarters of  so id say that thats probably the biggest reason why the  why it was lower in number i mean we still feel very good about the industry there is still a lot of potential lot of opportunity in new products being discussed with our customers being contracted so i think where we believe that were outgrowing the industry and we continue to do very well but we did have an uptick in the organic sales in the final nine months of  which i think is driving this george godfrey got it thank you and then just a followup the operating margin specifically on electronic technologies grew   i mean thats just outstanding is that a high watermark or is there even an opportunity to continue to march that up and then as a followon is robertson a material driver of that profitability there victor mendelson george this is victor its a very good question look it is always our objective to see margins improve but i wouldnt plan that in i wouldnt model that in i think the guidance that we gave you is the right place to look sometimes we have great quarters in margin other times its not as good i dont know if its a high watermark i honestly dont remember its toward the higher end and there are lot of factors that can contribute to it you remember  if you over time and listened to our conference calls and over the years and attended some conferences over the years you’ve heard me say that we managed the business and we have our companies manage their business to the year and not so much to the quarters that were very focused on maximizing profitability and margins and that just means we have lumpiness in the quarters over the course of the year and we really try to get people to look to the fullyear so were  if we do better thats great but we dont encourage people to look for more than our guidance on that in terms of robertson robertson is a contributor to the margins it is not the sole contributor to the margins its a very important business for us but truthfully the other businesses are very important too and pretty healthy i would say overall the company the etg across the board had a strong quarter george godfrey understood thank you for taking my questions victor mendelson thank you george operator our next question comes from larry solow with cjs larry solow to those questions for  eric on the fsg side i know you mentioned and you’ve continually mentioned a lot of the growth is  driven your growth at least by new product offerings how about just the underlying growth in the aftermarket is that basically or lack thereof is it still basically essentially nearly flat what’s your feel that you’re saying that improve at all obviously excluding the easier yearoveryear comp eric mendelson that’s a good question larry you know since we dont get very much price maybe we get  a year most of our grow  i mean basically all of our growth the  was due to unit volume growth and i think that unit volume growth of  is far in excess of what the industry is seeing number one so i think that we  were building up a tremendous amount of goodwill theres been a lot of new aircraft delivered over the last couple of years and are in that sort of  to  year range where they dont need much maintenance or they don’t need maintenance and i think that that’s having  that’s holding down the industry aftermarket growth and  but i think our numbers are really quite good when you look at basically  organic growth also it is important to point out and it was referenced in there that our specialty products business saw little bit of weakness this quarter and that probably trimmed off about  points of growth from the fsg segment so when you look at it i mean the organic unit growth was even higher and we feel very strongly about the new product the customer relationship you can see with the recognition by alta and i think that while that’s just one region of the world i think that typifies how our customers view us and i think were setting up very good  in a very good way for a nice up cycle as some of these newer  some of the newer equipment need maintenance because the oe prices on this newer equipment some of it is just crazy and yes of course we’ve got to develop the parts we got to get improved at the airlines we’ve to get install it etcetera but i feel very strongly that our strategy of maintaining basically a very low price increases in building a lot of customer goodwill is putting us in a very positive position with our customers larry solow okay great and then maybe a question for victor just i know  in terms of new defense budget it sounds about that’s going to  its still  its several quarters if not a year or plus away but i know on the last call you had mentioned and maybe in the last couple of calls you guys have seen a little bit less reluctance to spend sort of budgeted dollars is that trend still  anything shaking out on that side of the things victor mendelson at this point i think we should be careful to predict where things are going with the budget it was sort of flattish for us in defense in the quarter down slightly but to me within the noise level i still think that we should look for the net benefit next year not this year and i dont think weve seen things shakeout palpably except i have noticed and i think i mentioned this on the last call we have noticed in our businesses there is less reticence to spend and to commit dollars where in the past in the prior administration there were i call them quasiobstructionist efforts geared at finding ways to not spend the allocated money and thereby let it get redirected to something else and were not seeing that  we’re not seeing it as much and that the usual amount of confusion in the defense budget that exist over the years and decades is always there for us in terms of spending and why isnt this contract coming through or that contract why is it delayed and they have the agencies and departments at their own internal issues and generally speaking i think we all saw what was published yesterday on the budget proposal and thats only a proposal at this point as we all know our general view is its a net positive going forward but not to really expect it in a material way this year and of course as  as that gets delayed if it gets delayed then that would delay the benefit to us larry solow got it and just last question if i may just on the air cost control it looks like just from your cash flow statement you guys spent about  million on that and it sounds like its in your usual acquisition criteria immediately accretive is it fair to say that the impact from that or the effect from that is most of the reason behind the increase in guidance for the year carlos macau i think  larry this is carlos some of it was related to that the increase in guidance what from mid single digits to mid to upper single digits some of that was our cost control and some of that is higher expectations to some of our operating units so its a combination of both larry solow got it okay great excellent thanks guys operator our next question comes from louis raffetto with deutsche bank louis raffetto good morning gentlemen i’m going to stick with etg just you mentioned this the second quarter in a row i guess of good aerospace is that just linked to sort of high overall production rates or is there anything else there victor mendelson no  louis this is victor its  some of it is aftermarket some of its production i’d probably say maybe a little more aftermarket than production improvement but its a nice mix louis raffetto all right and then just sorry sanity check my numbers here i think the  you called out  growth in etg or  yes  growth but only organic was  i thought we were sort of at a clean yearoveryear now but  so i wasn’t sure what that discrepancy was carlos macau louis this is carlos i think the  was quarter six was a six month period so that’s multiple speakers louis raffetto okay all right and then just last one on the cash flow i guess it was just a bit below what i expected but obviously you’ve raised the guidance was there  and i think larry may have touched on this a bit but i may have missed it anything timing in the first half versus second half or in the second quarter i guess laurans mendelson no i think  louis i think generally speaking if you look back on history of heico and our cash generated by operations traditionally and it could change but traditionally the first half of the year from a cash flow generation standpoint is generally a little less than the latter half and so that’s part of it i would say as it relates specifically to this fiscal year there wasn’t anything unusual most of it was timing related we do have some  we had a little bit of an inventory build which if you look across our subsidiaries its directly tied to backlog or orders inhouse we had some timing on some accrueds that were paid out some of that was performance based comp related which is a little higher as a result of  operations versus the prior  operations which would have been accrued in that cash flow statement so i wouldn’t say there is any trend or any unusual items and that it was principally based on timing louis raffetto no purchase consideration or meaningful in the quarter i guess i know that you pointed to  million i think this year laurans mendelson no louis raffetto okay laurans mendelson the  million well louis i’m sorry louis raffetto the purchase consideration i guess i thought i think there is  million that was going to be paid out this year carlos macau we’ve already paid that out but that doesn’t come out operations louis raffetto okay carlos macau that’s operating cash flow that’s below that louis raffetto thank you operator our next question comes from ken hubert sic herbert with canaccord ken herbert hi good morning laurans mendelson good morning ken herbert i wanted to first ask a question for eric just bigger picture eric when you look at your conversations with your airline customers fuel prices seem to have settled in here if you look at your argument regarding delivery of aircraft currently we’re starting to see a slowdown in deliveries of certainly widebody aircraft have you seen any change or can you comment on any change you’ve seen from your airline customers maybe in their desire to spend on some of the older aircraft with  they maybe been  more benign fuel environment and maybe a little bit more predictability on the cost from that standpoint as you look through the rest of either your fiscal  or calendar  eric mendelson yes that’s a good question ken we’ve seen some increase in spending on some of the order equipment i think one of the  also one of the tougher comps as you pointed out in some of your reports is that last year there was a big pw overhaul a program and a lot of money that needed to be spent due to some service bulletins so i think that last years numbers in hindsight were probably helped by that which is making the comps a little bit tougher but yes we are seeing some increase in spending on the order equipment as you pointed out the build rate coming down on some of the widebody equipment and we dont have that factored into our numbers right now because we dont know really what the future is going to bring on that but clearly with widebody build rates being down and fuel being down i mean that should bode well for extending some of the time on some of the order equipments but again we dont have that baked into our projections at this point ken herbert okay thats helpful and now that you’ve completed the ac acquisition and obviously you’ve been able to build a very nice distribution business within fsg how do you think about organic growth maybe for specifically ac or maybe distribution at large within the segment not just in  but over the next few years eric mendelson yes i’m very positive in that area actually a week after  roughly a week after the mro show i went and visited ac in hamburg and toulouse and while i have been there in the past i can tell you that as i got to know the people better and we got into some of the details i was really super impressed by the company’s dna the people the processes the culture and we are immediately finding opportunities for our distribution companies to work together there really is no product overlap so we dont have a situation where we’d have multiple subsidiaries trying to sell the same product it truly is complimentary and the relationships that our existing distribution business has with seal dynamics and with the new distribution business with air cost control or acc i think its extremely complimentary and the people are on both  in both businesses are very excited to help open doors for the others and i got  i’d say some significant expectations for great opportunities down the road we met with some of the larger customers and agencies really viewed in an extremely unique light due to their business model their customer attentiveness i think this is a company that  years ago didn’t even exist and it started with one person and then two people in a little office and they learned how to again as other heico businesses do listen to their customers understand what they want proactively deliver highquality products find alternatives at a lower price and in meeting with some of acs customers acs growth was not by accident i mean it was by targeting these opportunities and making sure that the customers were very happy so i do see a great opportunity and synergy with the  with our distribution business and then of course with distribution and pma i mean there is the synergy that we’ve spoken about for a while and i would say i’m very bullish on this ken herbert well thank you very much for that color if i could just one final question for victor just a followup again on the margins in the quarter very impressive and i just want to make sure i heard you correctly really no sort of onetime items you specifically point to either from a mix standpoint or timing just good performance or is there anything in particular you would highlight as maybe something that doesn’t repeat with the segment moving forward victor mendelson yes overall i wouldn’t call at anything notable i think there were elements of everything in the quarter right we  the mix was favorable to us the i think the cost control if you will the attention to cost detail the opportunities that we are able to execute on were good i think we always have the business here or there were something pulls forward a quarter or with the quarter and maybe we had a little bit better in that regard but i don’t think anything outside of the noise level that we typically see on that so overall id say it was just kind of all the factors each adding up incrementally delivered it for us ken herbert okay thank you very much really nice quarter victor mendelson and carlos has something to add carlos macau yes i just want to add victors point is absolutely correct we’ve had the scenario this quarter in the etg where really all of our subs and the industry participants were firing on all cylinders occasionally that happens and we had a similar situation in q last year where we sort of had broad growth across all of the subsidiaries and when that happens and given the fact that most of the folks around this business units are very entrepreneurial and to victors point costconscious we get some nice leverage on our sga spend and we get some nice product mix and growth and so i wouldnt over read that to victors point we plan for diversification we plan for ups and downs within the segment by subsidiary and so the guidance we’ve given of  on the year we’d hope to do better but thats how we see things on a goforward basis based on backlog and what we can see at this point ken herbert great thank you very much operator our next question comes from rob spingarn with credit suisse robert spingarn hi guys laurans mendelson good morning eric mendelson good morning robert spingarn good morning i missed the beginning of your call because i was on another one so i’m not sure whether or not you talked about this or not but eric this ones for you have you talked at all incrementally about your opportunity on oem parts second source saying or whether its military or commercial any opportunities there eric mendelson no we havent covered that yet on the call i mean we continue to think and that’s a very good question we continue to think that there is opportunity as the air framers want to bring down the cost of operation of their equipment that there is opportunity for heico in that and i think that that’s an area for growth and opportunity for us as time goes on yes go ahead robert spingarn i’m sorry eric well i was going to ask you from a process perspective how might a cooperative effort to develop second source parts differ from a traditional pma process for an aftermarket part eric mendelson well i mean to be a little careful on this call because we of course have a number of competitors listening in and we love them robert spingarn understood eric mendelson i  unfortunately i cant go into the details on that but suffice it to say that the air framers and some of the larger oems don’t necessarily have the same interest as some of the smaller oems and where you got situation when airlines are complaining to manufacturers about the cost to maintain their equipment but there may be opportunity for some of those larger oems to put some pressure to reduce those costs and i think that thats really where heico would fit in robert spingarn okay excellent victor i wanted to ask you about margins that just got asked and so it sounds like we’ve just  both you and carlos had expected just a range of outcomes as we go its really depended on a mix of whats flowing through in the quarter did i get that right victor mendelson i think you’ve got that exactly right and again with the emphasis on expect what more of what were telling you for the year that  number and not the margins higher and if we do better great the objective is great it is high of course but lets keep where we are and by the way even  is not guaranteed none of this is easy and we work very hard but i cant be certain of where the margins will be either robert spingarn right right well i guess as a followup to that and somewhat related maybe carlos this is for you but as a percentage of sales and again this might have come up earlier sga look pretty  couple of quarters how are you expecting that to trend for the rest of the year is this a sustainable level under  of sales or how we should we think about that carlos macau i think that weve been blessed by the way that all our subsidiaries are entrepreneurial in nature they are very cost conscious we have no corporate initiative on costcutting these guys drive their businesses and what weve seen over the last couple of quarters is some leverage on the sga spend and i would anticipate  barring any one timers or anything like that i would anticipate to continue to catch some of that leverage on sga spend which is really a contributor frankly to our move up if you will on the consolidated margin to approximate  from a range of  to  robert spingarn right i guess when i look at it this makes  look a little more like  in terms of sga performance where  was relatively a little higher carlos macau yes again  yes you have to remember in  it was littered with  we had a onetime charge of about  million for an acquisition and there we had some fx impacts during  that we havent experienced this year so if you back historically  even maybe  and prior our sga expense  to  or so is kind of been the range … robert spingarn right carlos macau … and as we grow the business the top line at a greater rate than that sort of range bound sga expense we are catching leveraging and i’m quite proud of the guys for that robert spingarn okay all right well thank you hello larry sorry i didn’t have one for you laurans mendelson that’s fine they answered it better than i could robert spingarn there you go thanks guys operator operator instructions our next question comes from drew lipke with stephens andrew lipke yes good morning guys thanks for taking the time laurans mendelson good morning andrew lipke just for eric you pointed out the goodwill with customers and im curious if you think about maybe aircraft coming off warrantee maybe that kind of aging of the fleet there have you seen any kind of change in demand from your customers for replacement parts kind of meaning have you hit a tipping point where the demand has turned from more of a push to a push eric mendelson well if you take a look at our  the organic growth the fsg organic growth was about  then of course that was held down by a couple of points due to some slippage in the specialty products area so if you look at it were probably looking at roughly  unit growth and i think a lot of that is demand being if you will pulled by the customers we dont really differentiate it when we do the sales reviews dont really differentiate it between sort of what were pushing and what the customers are pulling its i think a group effort the goodwill is palpable and i think that that is really having or permitting us to find more opportunities with the airlines and i think setting up for a very good increase in sales as some of this newer equipment matures and is going to need maintenance and the price points are higher on the newer equipment so i think theres general recognition by the customers that there were a very important part of their  very important part of their approach in reviewing specific customers with our sales leadership i can tell you that there is  really at a high level at the airlines a desire to increase the amount of competitive procurement and heico is really at the forefront of that and ive heard in a number of examples whereby perhaps  years ago some of the finance folks were more likely to sign if you will power by the hour packages from the oems because of ease of  ease but now as those packages where on in duration and the airlines see that theyve got basically no operating leverage and heico has developed this reputation of not taking advantage of the customers when we can take advantage of the customers we’ve now seen a number of airlines tilt towards the competitive procurement site where they dont want to go with power by the hour they dont want to go with the oem because it ties their hands so to your point in terms of pullthrough i think that thats an example of  and we’ve seen this in a number of cases that’s an example where the airlines are really putting us in position to be able to further increase our unit volumes and supply more products i mean i’ve heard examples that some oems out there that have raised prices  or  per year for the last number of years and weve been  clearly we could have done the same and we did it and they recognize that and they  and thats why heico i believe has built this goodwill and why alta and others hold us in very high regard because our people do the right thing when nobodys looking and we do that because were very small we’re tiny compared to the industry and we were here for the longhaul and we want to be able to position ourselves and supply more parts and services and we think that our shareholders are going to be better rewarded by taking the long view and thats also frankly  it fits in very well with our people because we want people who want to be here we want team members who want to be here for the longhaul and want to be with the company that is moving in the right direction and is in the forefront of serving its customers so i think it really sets heico up very well for this pullthrough that you’re referencing and i anticipate we’re going to see a lot more of that over the next couple of years andrew lipke yes that absolutely makes sense and then your ability to increase your annual parts approval from  to maybe something greater if we start to see that greater pullthrough what are the gating factors there eric mendelson from a regulatory process were very confident that we can get them approved we’ve got a great relationship and a great rapport and confidence from regulators so i feel very comfortable about that it would require obviously increasing the engineering efforts a little bit also increasing the manufacturing effort but weve got plenty of capacity so i feel very very confident i mean we’ve been careful its a little bit of a chicken and egg thing because if we come out with too many products then the oems get very concerned and start cutting very good deal so we need to be very careful we know with whom we can develop products and we know that they’re really going to buy them and they’re just not going to use us as a stalking horse so we again want to be very careful on how we do this but i feel very confident that as this new equipment burns in that we are going to be increased be  we will be able to increase our product offerings and our new product approval process commensurate with the increase in demand i dont view that as a limiting factor whatsoever andrew lipke okay and last one from me pooling has been referenced as a headwind for the industry and if you also think about just the greater use of opensource it platforms for the supply chain and greater use of ecommerce solutions is there a silver lining for you guys and that allows you to highlight your lowerpriced position and provide more transparent pricing for you to capture more share victor mendelson yes i mean in general as i think as information becomes more readily accessible it definitely provides an opportunity for us it also permits our competitors to see more quickly what were doing and obviously thats not helpful to us but we  clearly with the airlines were able to point out the areas of savings the areas of opportunity there have been many newspaper or many media reports on the increases coming on particularly the cost of engine parts there have been a number of articles and independent reports that have come out particularly on the cfm and the c showing price increases over a year period roughly in the  per year area and airlines see that theyre not happy about it and i think that there is continued opportunity throughout the industry andrew lipke right thanks guys best of luck victor mendelson thank you laurans mendelson thank you operator our next question comes from jim foung with gabelli  company jim foung hi guys good quarter there laurans mendelson thanks jim jim foung i want to just ask about the specialty products i guess you said sales for that was a little disappointing maybe just talk a little bit about what happened there and you see a catchup in the second half of sales in that unit eric mendelson so jim in the specialty products area there is a higher proportion of  basically thats where all of our industrial business is and thats where some of our defense business is and there were two areas one i would say i think the second quarter probably saw the bottom of the industrial market were starting to see a pick up now i don’t want to get ahead of myself because we’re only less than a month into our third quarter but i think we are seeing a pick up in the industrial side so im fairly confident that we bottomed in that area and then with regard to defense this can be a lumpy business because these are fairly large contracts and sometimes there are breaks in production because the government is working with a foreign military sales order and one country can finish taking delivery of its product and then maybe there is a break until the next country sort of gets in line so that’s fairly common in the defense area so we’ve seen  that was the other source of weakness the other thing which we really need to take a look at is on the commercial aviation side theres been a shift in some of the production from widebody to narrowbody and i think that’s having an impact  a little bit of an impact on us and its probably going to hit other suppliers as well because some of the widebody production was requiring some additional products and that if you will has tick down whereas the narrowbody doesnt need as much of that on the oe side so  but it is also important to point out  i don’t want to overstate the industrial side for us because its only about  of fsg so it is not a very big part but thats why im sort of confident that we’ve hit the bottom there jim foung okay but that could kind of be a potential upside as you were up to the second half maybe there would be some catch up from the weaker first half then eric mendelson yes i think there could be and of course we need to see what happens with the widebody and the narrowbody production rate but yes i do think that there is a lot of catch up opportunity for the second half and frankly  in a big way jim foung and then just on the industrial i mean on the defense area maybe victor you can chime in on this typically there is kind of a yearend budget spending to make sure they get all the money spent so that they can request more money with the upcoming budget and do you typically get kind of a yearend surge in buying in the october fiscal year with the budgeting and i’m just wondering are you expecting that they should particularly if they’re talking about an increase in the budget in the fiscal  budget victor mendelson jim this is victor there is no reliable pattern or discernible pattern in that there have been times in the past where it would happen in november that we would get a bump because the government would essentially have spent their money and sort of run out of money so there are times when we actually see the inverse where things get quiet in the back end of the year get a little bit quiet on the backend of the year and because they’ve just run out of money to spend and then all of a sudden comes flying through in november weve seen the opposite effect where money has been clogged up for allocation reasons earlier in the year and it comes out later on in the year so its really difficult to say we’re not counting on any surge if you will in our defense revenue in the back half of the year and if that happens that’s great i guess that would be upside but we’re not counting on any of that right now jim foung yes i was thinking if they’re talking about an increase in the defense budget everyone wants to make sure they get their last dollars spent victor mendelson right yes jim foung all right that either comes in october or november you should see a little bit of it then in that case victor mendelson yes i mean that’s  i think that the more reliable sort of pattern but theres no  again there is no great discernible pattern as far as we’re concerned that we noticed on our business now maybe other people notice different things but in terms of what we noticed in our business over the years essentially government spending can lock up and unleash at any time during the year and we plan kind of according to the orders that we have and level loading our shops and more comes thats great but were not going to likelihood gear up for that and increase our spending for that jim foung okay and then last one for me would be i mean you’ve indiscernible just the stock options so a lot of companies are getting some lower tax rate from the exercise of options you had some of that in your second quarter you expect more in the second half of the year where your tax rate could be lower than you expect carlos macau hi jim so actually we  that particular phenomenon or new accounting guidance you’re talking about we’ve implemented in q jim foung okay carlos macau and so we did have a discrete tax benefit in q the impact cumulatively through six months is about  bump if you would in our eps i do believe based on that standard because it does force you to increase the denominator or the number of shares outstanding that will see that diminish down over the years so i dont expect that on an aggregate annual basis to have a significant impact on our overall rate jim foung okay and were you guiding for your tax rate to still kind of  for the year carlos macau well what we’re guiding to is between our income tax rate and our noncontrolling interest rate as a percent of pretax income roughly  to  for those two jim foung okay great all right thank you that’s all i have carlos macau thank you jim laurans mendelson thank you jim operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today’s qa session its now my pleasure to hand our program back over to laurans mendelson for any additional or closing remarks laurans mendelson thank you and to everyone on the call we thank you for
