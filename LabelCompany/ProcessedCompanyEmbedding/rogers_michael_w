with chiles minister of agriculture luis mayol bouchon middle right side and his colleagues to discuss regulatory and public health issues that affect both nations get this photo on flickr get consumer updates by email en español theres a good chance that some staple in your daily life—a food that you like or a medical product that you need—comes from latin america to ensure that these foods are safe and these medical products are safe and effective the food and drug administration fda has staff who represent the agency in  countries and territories within mexico central america south america and the caribbean and that staff brings multitasking to a whole new level latin american companies that manufacture grow or process products regulated by fda must meet the same federal standards applied to their us counterparts by working with local government and industry fdas latin america office lao helps ensure that this critical safeguard is effective thats no small task if you think about the  countries and territories that typically contain a ministry of health and a ministry of agriculture thats  entities we have the opportunity to communicate with sometimes on a daily basis says michael rogers lao director typically the ministry of health in each country covers medical products and processed foods while the ministry of agriculture covers produce of all the products regulated by fda which include food drugs medical devices and others about  percent come from the latin american region the percentage is even greater for fresh produce and seafood of the top  countries exporting fresh produce to the us eight—mexico guatemala chile the dominican republic peru costa rica honduras and ecuador—are in latin america laos challenge is made more complex by the fact that latin america is so diverse home to a wide variety of languages cultures and economic realities as well as a range of regulatory and public health systems laos responsibilities the lao opened posts in san jose costa rica and santiago chile in  a post in mexico city opened in  the post that focuses largely on brazil operates from fda headquarters in silver spring maryland laos responsibilities and strategic objectives include developing contacts to ensure that fda’s counterparts in latin america and stakeholders from industry commerce agriculture and academia are informed about fda regulations and processes affecting them establishing effective communication—in languages that include spanish portuguese and english—with fdas counterparts in each country working with headquarters in developing procedures for us inspection of latin american facilities involved in the production of fdaregulated products as well as working with local governments to join and follow up on fdas inspections when significant problems are observed assisting fda efforts in emergencies such as a serious and widespread problem with an fdaregulated product and coordinating with headquarters in fostering mutually beneficial partnerships related to laboratory testing for food safety opening lines of communication part of what we do is to figure out who the most relevant knowledgeable and influential people are whether in government industry commerce agriculture or academia says edmundo garcia assistant regional director in chile we know these people we know these agencies and they know us according to lisa lopez assistant regional director in costa rica key to these efforts are fda foreignservice national employees who come from the country in which they serve they not only speak the language literally but they know the nuances of their culture and government lopez says rogers says the agencys counterparts in latin america benefit by understanding fdas approach to product safety and quality i have seen that public health protection is a common language and mission between regulators he says in some cases we have seen host governments take fdas information about a noncompliant firm or product and subsequently initiate their own action these actions taken under local law not only maximize resources but far exceed what fda can achieve on its own rogers says one thing that has helped enormously has been the establishment of a single email address  poised to respond staff members at each post collect information to better understand the laws and regulatory systems that exist within the  countries and territories in an emergency such as a foodborne illness outbreak we need to be well positioned and prepared to reach out to regulatory entities so they can help us understand the scope of the problem and what fdas role will be in helping to restore safety rogers says further we work with headquarters to assess what impact the affected products might have on the us he adds should import inspectors be alerted are these products already in the us is a recall needed on the other hand rogers says it is important that latin american countries are well informed about essential us regulatory initiatives such as the landmark fda food safety modernization act fsma designed to prevent food safety problems before they occur i see fsma as an enormous game changer in the global marketplace of which latin america is a key player he adds lao staff has met frequently with latin american counterparts in agriculture public health and commerce to relay information about fsmas role in ensuring that imported products are safe for us consumers i have a saying rogers says in some cases whats old news to us is new news to the people who don’t have routine contact with the fda and so we are serving as the face of the agency to carry forward these messages this article appears on fdas consumer updates page which features the latest on all

claims priority from us provisional patent application ser no  filed on aug  background of the invention this invention relates to gasification and more particularly to a flexible gasification apparatus and method that provides combustible gases having high heating values while avoiding pitfalls of prior attempts at gasification gasification has generally been known for years in gasification a carbonaceous fuel source is partially combusted to produce a combustible gas synthesis gas or syngas the combustible gas is then combusted to produce work the combustible gases produced by gasification may find any number of uses including but not limited to supplying heat powering a motor or producing electricity gasification provides many advantages such as allowing fuels having relatively low heating values to be used allowing waste products to be used to produce work and similarly reducing the amount of waste material that must be sent to landfills despite these obvious advantages gasification has met with only limited success because gasification systems have typically been plagued by a number of disadvantages or difficulties for example the heating values of gases produced using prior art systems have tended to fluctuate to an undesirable degree particularly when a variety of fuel sources or fuel sources of varying compositions have been used similarly it has also proven difficult to consistently produce gases having sufficiently high heating values separating particulate matter from the produced gas has proven problematic similarly it has proven difficult to produce sufficiently clean gases having sufficiently low amounts of particulate matter as well as sufficiently low amounts of pollutants such as such as sulfur dioxide so nitrogen oxides nox carbon monoxide co and volatile organic compounds voc ammonia hydrogen chloride hcl and chlorides environmentally sound disposal of wastewater generated by such systems has also presented difficulties further still the presence of water or other liquids in the combustible gas has made it difficult or impossible to use blowers for moving the combustible gases without creating undesirable levels of wear and tear on the blowers summary of the invention it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a flexible gasification apparatus and method that provides combustible gases having

line  to maintain solid fuel within a desired height range within the inner chamber  the desired height range will vary depending upon a number of factors including but not limited to the properties of the solid fuel it is typically desirable to maintain the solid fuel level within the inner chamber  at the lowest possible level while still maintaining an adequate seal to prevent products of combustion from escaping through the top of the reaction vessel  the level desired will vary with factors such as the density and moisture content of the solid fuel for example the desired level for a solid fuel comprised primarily of chicken litter will be higher than the desired level for a solid fuel comprised primarily of wood pulp or paper mill sludge and the desired level for a solid fuel comprised primarily of wood pulp sludge will be higher than the desired level for a solid fuel comprised primarily of sanding dust in a typical operation in which the solid fuel is comprised primarily of chicken litter the level of solid fuel within the inner chamber  is preferably maintained at a height of approximately  inches to approximately  inches above the ring  similarly in an operation in which the solid fuel is comprised primarily of wood pulp sludge the level of solid fuel within the inner chamber  is preferably maintained at a height that is only slight above the ring  also in an operation in which the solid fuel is comprised primarily of sanding dust the level of solid fuel within the inner chamber  is preferably maintained at a height that is approximately even with or slightly below the ring  the blowers  draw gaseous products of combustion downward through the reaction vessel  so that they pass through the opening  in the inner wall  and upwardly through the outer chamber  before passing through conduit  combustible gas from the reaction vessel  enters a lower portion of the scrubber housing  and passes upward toward conduit  pump  circulates water to the scrubber housing  water enters the scrubber housing  through conduit  passes through sprayers and contacts the combustible gas the water cools and scrubs the combustible gas removing matter from the combustible gas including tar oil and particulate matter the water level in the scrubber housing  is maintained at a desired level so that tar oil and similar matter may be removed from the scrubber housing  via the skimmer line  particulate matter and other components that settle to the bottom of the scrubber housing  are periodically removed via blow down line  valves  are also opened periodically so that the pump  may circulate water through wash lines  and through conduits   and  for cleaning from time to time valve  may be opened so that the water in scrubber housing  may also be drained through line  and replaced with fresh water from line  the scrubbed combustible gas exits the scrubber housing  through line  passes through blowers  and is driven through filter housing  as it exits the scrubber housing  the gas may also be passed through a filterknockout pot before being passed to the blowers  wood chips in the filter housing  dry the gas and remove additional amounts of particulate matter and other pollutants wastewater and other matter that are removed from the combustible gas and that are not absorbed by the wood chips fall to the bottom of the filter housing  and are removed via line  scrubbed filtered combustible gas exits the filter housing  via line  from there the combustible gas is flared returned to the reaction chamber or sent to other uses during initial startup phase the combustible gas is flared until it is determined that gas is being produced at a desired quantity and quality once the startup phase is complete the combustible gas will primarily be passed via line  to produce work elsewhere for example the combustible gas might be combusted to supply heat to a process or might be combusted within a motor or turbine to produce work or to generate electricity as additional examples the combustible gas produced by the system  may be used in brooder heaters in poultry houses in internal combustion engines and in boilers in fact the combustible gas generated by the present system  compares quite favorably with natural gas often being cleaner while having comparable or higher heating values the heating values of the combustible gas produced will vary depending upon a number of factors such as the type composition and moisture content of the carbonaceous fuel provided but the heating values of the combustible gas produced will typically be at or near  btu per cubic foot accordingly combustible gas produced using the present system  is a good candidate for use in any situation that currently uses natural gas or propane depending upon the properties of the carbonaceous fuels being supplied to the reaction vessel  such as the moisture content a portion of the combustible gas may be returned to the reaction vessel  via line  to supply additional fuel to aid in the partial combustion of the carbonaceous fuel the combustible gas supplied via line  may serve as a complete or partial replacement for the alternate fuel source supplied to the reaction vessel  via line  returning the combustible gas to the reaction chamber  offers a number of advantages for example it saves on fuel costs that might otherwise be required to maintain the desired combustion in the reaction vessel  the combustible gas will typically burn at higher temperatures than natural gas and the higher temperatures are often desirable in the reaction vessel  for example natural gas may burn at a temperature of approximately ° f whereas a typical combustible gas produced using the present system  may burn at a temperature of approximately ° f lines    and  pass from the scrubber housing  and the filter housing  to recycle housing  these lines    and  pass wastewater excess water from wet fuel components tar oil particulate matter and other removed substances to an upper portion of the recycle housing  these components pass from the recycle housing  via line  and pump  passes these components via line  back to the reaction chamber  where they are fed into an upper portion of the reaction vessel  a portion of these components is diverted via line  and returned to the recycle tank  to help stir or agitate the contents of the recycle tank  returning the wastewater and other components to the reaction vessel  provides a number of advantages for example the wastewater scavenges additional residual carbon from the ash as the water is broken down this provides for better recovery of the heating value from the carbonaceous fuel and eliminates or drastically reduces the need to dispose of wastewater the system  may be used to process a wide variety of carbonaceous fuels as well as combinations thereof the spacing between the ash support member  and the opening  of the inner wall  as well as the relatively unobstructed side openings there allow a wide assortment of solid fuels to be used without fear of clogging possible carbonaceous fuels include but are not limited to things such as chicken litter other animal waste municipal solid waste glued woods such as plywood and press board paper mill or wood pulp sludge including sludge with a moisture content of  or higher wood or yard waste and shredded tires liquid carbonaceous fuels may also be added including but not limited to waste motor oil and cooking oil adding these liquid carbonaceous fuels can markedly increase the heating value of the combustible gas produced the following emissions test examples illustrate that the gasification system  of the present invention can produce combustible gas that is environmentally friendly while dispensing with solid carbonaceous fuels that previously posed serious landfill issues example  an emissions test was conducted on combustible gas generated by the system  while combusting chicken litter a sample run of  minutes in duration was performed testing was performed in accordance with the methods detailed in  cfr part  appendix a the flow based on the lowest recordable flow had a velocity of  feet per second and the sample collected had a volume of  dry standard cubic feet the results of the emissions testing are summarized in table  below table

emissions test was conducted on combustible gas generated by the system  while combusting paper mill sludge a sample run of  minutes in duration was performed testing was performed in accordance with the methods detailed in  cfr part  appendix a the flow based on the lowest recordable flow had a velocity of  feet per second and the sample collected had a volume of  dry standard cubic feet the results of the emissions testing are summarized in table  below table emissionssubstancelbshrparticulate matter based on lowest detectable flow ratevoc as propane corrected for moisturenitrogen oxides as nocarbon monoxidesulfur dioxide other modifications changes and substitutions are intended in the foregoing and in some instances some features of the invention will be employed without a corresponding use of other features for example the configuration of the ash support member  may be used in combination with any number of different gasification systems regardless of whether such systems also use other features of the present invention and may also find uses in systems other than gasification systems similarly the wastewater return features of the present invention may be used in combination with any number of different gasification systems regardless of whether such systems also use other features of the present invention and may also find uses in systems other than gasification systems further the wood chip filtering of the present invention may be used in combination with any number of different gasification systems regardless of whether such systems also use other features of the present invention and may also find uses in systems other than gasification systems further still the hybrid blower  design of the present invention may be used in combination with any number of different gasification systems regardless of whether such systems also use other features of the present invention and may also find uses in systems other than gasification systems of course quantitative information is included by way of example only and is not intended as a limitation as to the scope of the invention accordingly it is appropriate that the invention be construed
