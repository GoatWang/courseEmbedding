handle being hunted its still one step at a time holtz said we hadnt even got to where we were in the hunt let alone been the hunted this game was big theres no doubt we talked to our team all week about this was not a big picture game this was a game about us and southern miss this was a game about how we had been beaten  the last two years  the last time the seniors came down here this was a game of us against southern misss program this was just one at a time focus on what weve got to get done out here and they found a way to win retaining that focus will be paramount when the pirates
