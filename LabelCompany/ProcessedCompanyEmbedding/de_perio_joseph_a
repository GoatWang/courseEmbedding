the sources indicated above clinton group letterhead december   imation corp imation wayoakdale minnesota  attention board of directors gentlemen i write on behalf of clinton group inc clinton group the investment manager of several funds and partnerships that collectively own a stake in the common stock of imation corp imation or the company we continue to buy shares of imation today we own common shares of the company because we believe there is significant untapped value at the company  however we are reluctant buyers today even at these valuations given the track record of the management team and board of directors over the past few years  i believe the market shares our view on the prospects of the company given the low enterprise valuation and the stock price near  per share today we do not believe this predicament has to persist and that shareholders deserve better  as you know on november th and also today we submitted a notice to nominate three individuals to stand for election against the incumbent class of directors up for election in   we believe the individuals in our notice possess the domain expertise operational capability turnaround experience and financial acumen to move imation forward from the depths it languishes in today  in fact upon a successful proxy contest and if mutually acceptable clinton group would welcome the opportunity to invest in common equity at a premium to prevailing market prices as we believe under the right leadership the stock could at least triple in value from here  in our subsequent proxy filings in the coming months we will elaborate on such plans to achieve this reversal in performance lets look closer at our nominees  bob fernander is a longtime executive in the storage and software sectors and possesses significant chief executive officer experience and domain expertise in cloud storage hyper converged storage and compute big data analytics ip video vdi virtualized storage  compute san nas and das  bob can evaluate the product roadmap for nexsan and ironkey among other business lines and let us know what we have what it can be and what it is worth  barry kasoff has owned and operated his own management consulting and turnaround firm since   he has served as the chief restructuring officer in a number of companies that were going through troubled business environments  the board may not think the situation at imation necessitates a restructuring focus but clinton group does and i have the utmost confidence barry can lead an internal team or external team to that end  i am confident that a significant restructuring effort can deliver a cash flow positive business eliminate the corporate waste redefine the return thresholds for capital allocation eliminate or dispose of business lines not accretive to the whole and deliver significant equity value creation to all shareholders finally and humbly i would bring the shareholder perspective to imations board of directors that has been absent for so long  without prejudice i would look with an entrepreneurs eye at all of the companies expense categories and capital needs examine decisions to divest nonperforming or lowreturn on invested capital businesses and evaluate returning cash to shareholders or reinvesting excess capital at high returns to deliver outsized equity returns we will not use this letter as a forum to proffer the case for significant change at the corporate leadership of the company as i believe a cursory view of public information would bear the facts that speak for themselves  in forthcoming proxy materials we will expound in great detail the missteps by management the failed capital deployment strategy empirical evidence of underperformance relative to peers and the egregious choices the board has made about its own compensation  additionally we read with great interest the companys press release last week on the boards intention to appoint dr geoff barrall on december    it was interesting and curious for two reasons  firstly we note that in an august  imation announced the resignation of two board members and the chairmans statement that the resignations were tied to a longterm plan to both reduce the size and cost of the board   finally our institution knows dr barrall personally and i was surprised not to receive a call from him prior to the press release  given that our nomination notice was filed with the company almost a month prior to dr barralls appointment i would assume that a forthright board of directors would notify candidates of a looming proxy contest prior to his or her deliberations before accepting such a position i bring this up as segue to our cautionary views on the topic of board entrenchment  given our experience in situations like these over the many years we have seen every trick in the book of an entrenched board – surrounding themselves with attorneys advisors and crises management firms altering the companys bylaws contesting nomination notices and other procedural matters adding members to the board engaging bankers to pursue strategic alternatives and terminating the ceo abruptly  in our last two proxy contests were we sought and prevailed in replacing a majority of directors stillwater mining inc and evine live inc fka valuevision media inc management and incumbent directors spent  million and  million respectively on such defensive and entrenchment endeavors  in each case our expenditure as a firm was a fraction of the amounts spent by such incumbents as they were our dollars not shareholders dollars we were spending and the proxy contests ended in decisive votes in favor of clinton groups nominees  it should not be expensive for you to present the boards track and goforward strategy to shareholders and allow them to decide the fate of their company  we encourage our fellow shareholders to speak their mind to the management team and board on this very issue and urge them not to engage in this wasteful spending for the sole purpose of the boards entrenchment in sum we have spoken to a number of large shareholders of the company today and believe that there is support for significant change at the companys corporate leadership  in the upcoming new year we look forward to bringing our case to shareholders and more importantly articulating our vision for the path forward  sincerely yours ss joseph a de periosenior portfolio manager                                                             source clinton group inc view table fullscreen view table fullscreen
