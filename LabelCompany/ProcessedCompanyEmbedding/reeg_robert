information frequently asked questions future dates commencement traditions contact us good morning everyone my name is rob reeg and i am the president of mastercard technologies i am responsible for the strategic processing platform global network and quality of technology operations at mastercard worldwide thats an involved way of saying that i make sure customers can use their cards to pay for the things that matter to them whenever they need to do so another very large part of my role is as a manager of people helping support and manages the careers of the technologists and other team members that work at mastercard its a job i take very seriously a little bit of background on me ive been with mastercard for  years and have worked in a number of different management roles in the technology organization before joining mastercard i worked in it and business leadership positions with sprint corp cleveland pneumatic totco inc and conoco inc being a part of the university of missourist louis is important to me for a number of reasons first its a great learning institution and one that members of my family as well as a number of the employees that work for me have attended or are attending second this is a great university that makes st louis an even more attractive place for students to come to study but as they get to know the area they decide to stay as they enter the working world good news for business managers like me who are looking for strong candidates for important jobs finally as someone who values giving back to the community i enjoy serving on umsls leadership council and providing the perspective from the business community to shape the programs you have studied and now id like to focus on each of you what a sincere pleasure it is to be here today to celebrate one of the most important days in your life  graduation its finally here  the culmination of all of your hard work studying exams deciding on a major studying some more changing your major more studying changing your major again and finally finding out what it is that you are passionate about and what you want to do as you move into this next phase of your life its certainly a day of celebration and its important to take the time to do just that celebrate this accomplishment with your family and friends reflect on the time its taken to achieve this goal and take time to think about whats next for you youll hear a lot of things today and im sure most will be a blurtheres so much going on for each of you and i know your brains must be near capacity wrapping up final projects exams etc but if i may id like you to share with you three things that i think will serve you well as you begin or continue your careers  you are the architect of your own career  learning and developing your skills should be lifelong habits  seek advice and help when you need it pretty simple right but its amazing how when most people get busy and involved in their careers they forget to do these things but these guidelines can make significant impacts on your career and your life let me address each of these one at a time you are the architect of your own career im often surprised when people come and ask me what should i do in my career i believe that it is the responsibility of each person here to serve as the architect of your own career i recently read an article by dr robert fullmer of pepperdine university that says the average college graduate will change jobs  times in his or her career and that number is only expected to grow choosing an employer or field in which to work today isnt the last decision that youll make about your careerits among the first in companies like mine we have job families and plans to help develop individuals for the next role but we look to employees to have discussions with their managers and with their managers manager to help us understand each individuals aspirations as a people manager director or a company president your career path is not something i can craft for you ultimately only you know what you want to do luckily if you pay attention to some basics you will be guided on this journey each of us has unique strengths that are a combination of our skills and interests think about ityou made the decision to choose a particular major because you have strong skills in a particular area or because the area seemed appealing to you now id like to ask you a couple of questions i know you thought the tests were over this will be short i promise  how many of you during your college career took courses because they were interesting to you not because they were required coursework show of hands  how many of you looked for an organization to belong to while you were in school that helped you meet people network or support an interest you have in the community show of hands not bad see you already know what im talking about skills and interests what are you naturally good at what comes easily to you what do you ask others for help on these questions can help you identify your skills interests are a bit different what energizes or inspires you what do you spend your free time doing what will you argue about because its important to you so you have completed such a significant accomplishment related to your skills and interests and believe me i understand that you may not want to look at a book for a while but stay with me because my second recommendation to you is this learning and developing your skills should be lifelong habits in a world that is changing as quickly as ours skills that are crucial at one moment become less important and new types of jobs emerge all the time as new technologies and fields emerge you may find new interests developing you need to be prepared to change your career when it makes sense for you to do so you have to keep your skills current and gain new skills doing so is the best way to stay marketable and attractive to your existing employer or even new employers simply put take the time for professional development you can do this several ways take a class to learn a new skill perhaps your company will offer workshops or online training or you can find training in your local area join a professional organization that allows you to meet other people in your field offers educational sessions locally or sponsors a national or international conference stay current on new developments in your chosen field through professional journals podcasts webinars or continuing education classes look for opportunities to move roles within a company to grow your skill set its also a great way to enhance skills that need additional development in my own experience developing my own skills is something i focus on all the time as an individual i want to keep developing my own skills but perhaps more importantly as a person who manages other people i want to keep this priority on lifelong learning top of mind as well seek advice and help when you need it and finally remember to seek advice and help when you need it no one plans creates and manages a career on hisher own and you cant always manage each issue and challenge that you face in your job you need people that you can go to for help for counsel and to be a sounding board also dont fall into the trap of becoming complacent about your careers im sure youve heard the saying  you miss  of the shots you dont take you can say the same about career opportunities you miss  of those that you dont let people know you want or that you dont actively pursue your boss your colleagues and people in your network can be advocates for you if they know what you want to accomplish and there are a lot of resources available for you to help you chart your career the career center here at university of missourist louis is a good place to start career counselors there can help you identify jobs that match the skills that you have and work with you to plan for additional skills if there are jobs that are appealing to you in other industries as you continue in your career there are companies that you may join that offer career centers and planning for you as part of the human resources function i encourage you to take advantage of these ive had the benefit of some great mentors throughout my career that have helped me through tough challenges job changes and ways to stretch beyond the things i was comfortable doing to in order to become comfortable with those things that i really needed to be doing feedback and suggestions from my mentors werent always easy to hear but often it was just what i needed to hear by listening and adjusting to their feedback i ended up a stronger employee colleague and leader because of the people in my network who care about my success with this in mind i cant stress enough how important networking is for a persons career and the good news is most of you are doing some form of this already if youre on facebook twitter linked in youre networking youre creating a group of people that you can go to for help with getting a job growing your career seeking advice to be a sounding board and more i encourage my staff to use all of these and hope you will as well to help develop your career organizations are continually looking at social media options as a way to recruit new employees to their companies and you want to make sure your name is out there being considered so as you enter the workforce and youre meeting new people and trying new things remember to continue to build your network and id also suggest that you keep in touch with those people in your network on a regular basis whatever works for you so that they know what youfre doing and what youd like to do so they can help make sure to connect with your network when things are going well for you when theyre trying and in times in between the relationships with those people in your network should be twoway youre looking out for those people in your network the same way they are for you help those people in your network make important connections talk about their goals and opportunities and think about how you can help them and they in turn can do the same thing for you so as you graduate today with a degree from the  college of arts and sciences  college of education  college of fine arts and communication  a bachelorfs degree in general studies  a bachelors degree in interdisciplinary studies or  a masters of public policy administration
