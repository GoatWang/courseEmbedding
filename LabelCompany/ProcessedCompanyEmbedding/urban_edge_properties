finally accomplished the spinoff of urban edge properties “ue” this new independent publicly company will start regular trading under the ticker symbol “ue” on the nyse from today ue has stake in  strip shopping centers  malls and one warehouse park that were previously under vornado’s ownership shareholders of vornado received one share of ue for every two units of vornado held as on the close of business on jan   for fractional shares the distributions would be made in cash notably ue shares have traded on a “when issued” basis on the nyse under the symbol “ue wi” since jan   allowing shareholders the right to receive ue shares in this distribution vornado will however continue to trade under the same ticker symbol vno the move comes as part of vornado’s efforts to streamline its business the company which has been subject to criticism for venturing into too many sectors would now be able to focus exclusively on office properties and retail shops in washington and manhattan on the other hand ue is expected to unleash its potential of shopping centers and malls spanning over  million square feet across  states and puerto rico with concentrations in new jersey new york and pennsylvania   the two businesses have been together for legacy reasons but with no real operating synergies we believe the creation of two focused real estate investment trust reits would help in

investment trust who sought a sleek elegant and functional headquarters  in nyc where they could go to market with their concept of “cutting edge” development of commercial retail space one of the primary challenges in this wrap around site was creating a functional space despite the preponderance of columns the designers the switzer group worked closely with arenson’s office furnishings and architectural products divisions in creating a coherent visual aesthetic between its parts the customized knoll graham finished in wood veneer used in the private offices mimic the large and elegant mass of the walls selected by switzer in contrast to the granular texture and mass of the walls arenson’s architectural products provided dorma’s lightweight glass partitions to leave the core and outer offices of this wraparound site open and visible a memorable feature is the custom built and site specific wraparound executive desk which was installed and cutaround a column on site the desk is a section desk with varying surface grade directions and a grain to grain match along the separate parts to create a seamless fit the brass edge and hardware detail match the custom built coffee table a few feet away additional features include the conference and board rooms furnished with prismatique conference tables in glacier white corian and brushed stainless steel the seating used throughout the site are from knoll’s ergonomic and classic collections back to top login to access your account username password forgot your password remember me do not check if using a shared
