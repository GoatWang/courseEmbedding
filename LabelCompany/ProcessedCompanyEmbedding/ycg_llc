should come out ahead” — brian yacktman home about us philosophy strategies performance literature mutual fund home about us philosophy overview price product people option enhancement strategies performance literature overview we employ a disciplined investment strategy seeking primarily equities of any market capitalization that we believe will produce high riskadjusted forward rates of return ie the longterm compound annualized return that we believe a given security will achieve when purchased at the current market price however we are opportunists and may occasionally invest in other asset classes in making our investment decisions we use a “bottomup” approach focused on individual companies rather than focusing on macroeconomic factors we search for above average businesses trading at below average prices we think this approach combines the best features of socalled growth and value investing in order to select investments we use independent inhouse fundamental research to analyze each company with a  year time horizon in mind we seek to purchase stocks which possess one or more of the following three p’s price product people once we have determined the companies in which we would like to become business owners we may use “option enhancement” as a means to generate additional income and to enter and exit positions price  contact us terms  conditions privacy
