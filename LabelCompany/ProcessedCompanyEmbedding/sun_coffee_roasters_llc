use several units extensively for roasting in our offices the behmor  plus replaced the behmor  in september  the only change between the plus and its predecessor is a new control board aka pcb that will provide additional roasting controls and information the pcb will allow home roasters to switch between the original automatic profiles and new manual settings users will be able to read thermistor and exhaust temperatures and also switch between two drum speeds please note if you own a behmor  you can convert it to the plus model by purchasing and installing a behmor plus upgrade kit available on our site for  behmor continually tries to improve its products within the past couple of years there have been improvements to the chaff tray a fan was added to the side panel and the roasting grid itself was simplified with an easy clasp and welds made at each intersection so that gaps cannot develop we always have the latest model available free shipping in continental usa

canada   shipping discount applies to any method hi ak use coupon code shipbehm during checkout canada use shipbehmc low profile chaff tray the behmor plus ships with the latest low profile chaff tray this chaff tray design significantly improves bean visibilityenhances airflow for improved cooling as well as collecting chaff better than its predecessor it represents behmors commitment to improve the roasting experience and results for users of our mutual home roasting customers latest behmor low profile chaff tray leftprovides unobstructed view of roasting grid as compared to original clever solutions for real enhancement the tray has a series of vanes or louvers that open when in the in use position meaning when inside the roaster during roasting the chaff that comes off the roasting coffee is blown over and behind the louvers trapping it by doing so the chance of chaff ignition is all but eliminated while airflow for the roast itself is improved air passes through the vanes but chaff is left behind a clever solution and a real enhancement one of the original criticisms of the behmor was the difficulty in seeing beans within the roasting chamber as they were partially blocked by the old style chaff tray a workaround was developed where a piece of the mesh was cutout to allow better vision now with the new low profile chaff tray that workaround is obsolete the new chaff tray is only half the height as its predecessor see above ending beneath the window in the door the user now has an unobstructed view of the coffee roasting within the louvers or vanes are shown in photo left on right a rear view of the new chaff tray the handle on the outside opens and closes the vanes the most uptodate versions of the behmor  plus manual warranty and safeguards can be downloaded by following these links behmor  plus we have a terrific relationship with joe behm the inventor and developer of this roaster who had been working on it for seven years prior to its introduction the roaster prior to its official release took the best new product award at the  specialty coffee association show in long beach a real coup the behmor  was introduced to the public in 7 and we have been offering the roaster since the first day today very many behmors are in use and there is a legion of satisfied customer who have become come to enjoy the benefits of home roasting the easy smokeless way the behmor  plus roasts   or  pound of coffee it has a choice of five profile programs you cannot save program changes but some modifications can be made to roasts during a roast cycle to alter results a terrific feature is the behmors smoke suppression system which is very effective at nearly eliminating roasting smoke and much of the associated aroma this roaster as the instructions will tell you is not for doing dark roasts the maximum roast darkness is  seconds beyond the second crack which would be approximately a lightly spotted roast a little beyond full city or what you might describe as a light viennese roast if you wish to roast coffee darker than this you should look at our other choices in home roasters but if your needs are in the realm of lighter roasts which are best for coffees flavor nuances the behmor is a real contender the behmor  plus offers a lot of surprises an din many ways it is a wolf in sheeps clothing upon opening the shipping box the first impression was that the box itself was substantial when we took the roaster out of the inner product packaging a few things stood out firstly and everyone will say thisthe roaster looks like a toaster oven or perhaps a microwave i have to admit its nicely made and its obvious from the outset that a lot of detail and thought has gone into its finishes the exterior pull down door has brushed stainless facing out with a knife shaped window a couple of inches tall and nearly the full width of the door to the right of the door is the control panel and display behmor construction details open the front door and the first thing that greets you is perforated stainless steel upon unpacking the roaster and reading the directions fully you will learn that this is the chaff collector and it is fabricated of stainless throughout it has a pivoting grab handle attached to its exterior on its interior is a shiny stainless dustpan floor which will later be used to catch any chaff that did not get caught in the device a inch paintbrush provided is the broom this combination a little humorous at first is like many aspects of the behmor  plus that you will later come to appreciate it works behmor stainless chaff collector front and rear views after removing the chaff collector you will see the cylindrical grid in which coffee actually roasts when removed the grid or drum opens on one end and has a clamp to keep it closed the clamp itself has recently been simplified smalllarge roasting cylinder update originally behmors were packed with one cylinder an dafter some time users wanted one with smaller spacing so small or irregular shaped beans would not fall through the grid hence the socalled small grid cylinder was developed and it eventually became the standard issue replacing the original in late december  the third generation of grid was introduced the latest grid which has a diagonal pattern has a simplified clasp on the end where coffee is loaded it also has welds at each intersection which replace an unwelded basketweave pattern that had some small potential for spreading a smoke suppression exhaust system b behmor roasting drum the drum of course turns during roasting it can only attach to the roaster housing and its motor one way one side of the drum has a square peg that fits into a square hole the other side is rounded and slips into a receiving collar once the square end is in place you are to lift up on the left side collared end and moving the drum to the left it should withdraw from the square hole with the drum out the interior is clean and surrounded by clean aluminum coated steel surfaces at the rear of the roaster are its heating elements two watt glassheating elements for a total of watts more than other home roasters this is one reason the behmor is capable of roasting up to a pound at the top of the interior is heated exhaust which is responsible for removing smoke and some roasting odor the interior is lit and the light can be turned on after the start of a roast with a button on the control panel the light goes out after the cooling cycle has ended unless you want to turn it off sooner drum fits into square hole on right and into hook left roasting with the behmor  plus this roaster was designed to appeal to a broad range of consumers meaning that it had to be simple enough to be a home appliance for anyone interested in home roasting without their full immersion in coffee knowledge and roasting technique but it also needed to have some of the bells whistles and controls for the experienced or techsavvy enthusiast  a tall order and likely an impossible one the behmor  plus adds optional manual controls and readouts that were missing from the previous model also to increase the safety of home roasting behmor has added an blinking alert at 7 into the roast that verifies you are in attendance and paying attention to your roast if you dont hit the start button within  seconds then the roast will end this requires you stay by the roaster and watch its display rather than walk away and risk an issue for a detailed overview of new features available in the behmor plus and its control panel please head here being a very quiet roaster it is easy to hear coffee go through first crack behm has no doubt done laborious measurements to determine about how long it takes for coffee to go from first to second crack under various conditions such as bean type weight of coffee being roasted and selected profile in their manual they direct you to use their rosetta stone a simple guide to how long it takes for coffee to go from first to second crack based on bean weight taking their advice in this regard is good idea especially for new users even those with prior roasting experience the roasters interior  watt light provides enough visibility to see bean development with the advent of the new low profile chaff tray you now have an unobstructed view a real improvement over the taller original tray you will get the hang of roasting on the behmor quickly you will also find that the profiles built in to the behmor are very close to what you will likely seek in finished roasts and highly repeatable this roasters ability to repeat results is one of its strengths profiles  as previously mentioned there are five preset roasting profiles joe behm inventor of the behmor is not a coffee roaster himself by trade but he had valuable input and advice from some experienced industry insiders in developing these profiles the instructions provided suggest which profile to use for a particular type of bean which they classify ashard soft or island further there are specific instructions about roasting   or  pound of coffee for each of the profiles weight of the coffee being roasted increases roast time with full pounds reaching more than twenty minutes this may be of concern to some but coffee can be roasted for extended times as long as it is not baking or causing beans to chip keypad  the control panel keypad is broken into sections for roast weight    or pound programs  which are initial start times associated with each roast weight time increment  which are really time adjustments pressing the  button increases roast time in  second increments up to the maximum allowed for each profile and weight combination the  button decreases roast time in  second increments profiles  variable methods to achieve different taste elements from any given coffee other buttons  startoff light and cool are selfexplanatory cool begins the cooling cycle immediately to do a roast choose a profile and select the appropriate weight of coffee to be roasted   or  pound once those decisions have been made you would press a series of buttons to start a roast for example if you wanted to roast a half pound of hard bean guatemala at profile  you would press these buttons  p bstart the first button selects the weight the second the profile the third b sets a time adjustment in this case  minutes and finallyyou press the start button to begin the roast shown below are the initial start times associated with each weight and program buttons these can be further adjusted with the plus and minus time increment buttons up to the maximum allowed for each profile and weight combination initial roast times      a    b    c    d    important we observed no hot spots tipping or chipping of the beans during any roast cycles beans roasted uniformly the drums design which has several paddle sand vee shapes provides for ample mixing and movement during roastingalso of significance coffee is not roasting in a smoky environment soothe roasted beans have a cleaner brighter taste many commercial roasters cannot lay claim to this not to mention home roasters profiles detailed p  basically ramps right on up to  power and keeps that level for  of the roast time producing the quickest roast notation  p  like p ramps at for the first  of the roasting time then drops to 7 power for the next  of time full power for remainder of roast notation 7  p  a more gradual rampup during the first  of time roasts at 7 power  power during next  of time full power during remainder of roast notation 7   p  a variation on pduring the first  of time roasts at 7 power  power during next of time full power during remainder of roast notation 7  p  the longest roast with the slowest most gradual rampup roast time is broken into thirds with 7  and  power supplied in each segment respectively notation 7   here is the logic p is the hottest fastest roast p the slowest and the others are variations in between behmor shows p and p as roasts for hard bean coffeesp for soft beanlow grown coffees p for soft or espresso blendsand p for island coffees such as those from hawaii jamaica etc roasted to citycity our own assessment and preference differs slightly for a number of coffees we have roasted we find ourselves gravitating to p and p for many coffees these profiles provide brightness plus body the p profile is a sharp contrast to the others in that it produces roasts that are definitely skewed toward acidity many of the mid tones and body are missing nonetheless it is informative to seethe effects on the final output while the roasting profiles cannot be altered or reprogrammed it is possible to add or subtract time to roasts once they have started and effectively tweak them in this fashion this roaster is unique in that you can continue to add increments up to the maximum allowed for each profile and weight combination see chart below though be cautioned once past second crack you will begin to be inundated with smoke and this roaster has not been designed to produce dark roasts the hottop by contrast allows the user to add thirty second plus times in total to the preset roast time maximum roast times  the roaster will not let you roast longer than the times shown below for each weight and profile as indicated maximum roast times      p    p    p    p    p  7  conclusion the behmor  proved to be the most popular home roaster on the market the plus model takes it to the next level making manual controls available in addition to fully automatic settings in addition new readouts provide the temperatures of the exhaust channel or chamber wall the bottom line is that it roasts coffee very well and does so with minimum of noise and smoke making it well suited to home use the price point puts it in reach of most consumers filling a gap between the smaller roasters that sell for less than  and the larger ottoman genecafe roasters that sell for hundreds more also the flexibility to roast batches up to a full pound yet as small as quarter pound is terrific profiles are effective the appearance of the roaster though not roasterlike will feel at home in kitchens or other areas of the home we strongly recommend that you restrict yourself to  pound roasts until you have gained real proficiency with the roaster before moving on to larger roasts this will reduce failures and increase safety behmor recommends you refer to the latest product documents this manual provides more detail than the one packed with the roaster reference materials available for download behmor operation manual other important updates  updated maintenance troubleshooting and more look here for the most common issues important note the behmor  plus is designed for use in volt  hz environments only this roaster will not work in countries with any voltage andor frequency differences with or without a power converter manufacturers warranty is void outside of north america for roasters originating in the usa   product reviews related items behmor low profile chaff tray  behmor plus upgrade
