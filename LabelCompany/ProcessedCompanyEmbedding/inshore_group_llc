reactors catalysts  other products that we sell activated carbon reactivation  recycle  open section any time we can recycle rather than dispose of a product we encourage that practice we work with our carbon suppliers to safely and efficiently reactivate spent carbon to create a viable resalable product versus additional volume going to our landfills a brief description follows “after an activated carbon’s adsorptive capacity has been exhausted it can be returned to calgon carbon for thermal reactivation in the reactivation process the spent activated carbon is heated in furnaces devoid of oxygen using steam as a selective oxidant the adsorbed organics are either volatilized from the activated carbon or pyrolysed to a carbon char the volatilized organics are destroyed in the furnace’s afterburner and acid gases are removed by means of a chemical scrubber the hightemperature reaction with steam serves to restore the adsorptive capacity of the activated carbon” corrosion modeling  open section coastal chemical works closely with the university of louisianalafayette’s corrosion research center coastal chemical currently owns licenses to three of the university’s corrosion models listed below ull gas well corrosion model ull flowlinepipeline corrosion model ull co hs  bacteria pitting corrosion model using these computer models allows coastal to accurately depict insitu environments under downhole conditions and surface conditions—flowlines and pipelines transmission or gathering in addition coastal chemical utilizes ull’s co hs  bacteria pitting corrosion model which requires an accurate concentration of organic acids contained within the system because of this coastal chemical now quantifies acetate and formate content within every complete water analysis performed drilling rig and gas engine oil program  open section this program was developed to service drilling rigs and gas engines to maximize value for our customers and ensure their assets reach optimum utilization rates at the lowest overall cost without risking the integrity of their equipment this is accomplished through continuous review of products and processes to make

heat transfer fluid system cleaning  open section the buildup of solids or sediment in pipelines can cause a significant decline in operating efficiency especially in deep water where depths and water temperature can create a variety of flow problems our many years of experience in handling contaminated pipeline systems both onshore and offshore have led to the development of an innovative package of environmentallyfriendly cleaning solutions marketed under the nspec® brand name a unique feature of nspec® chemicals and services is that they allow pipeline operators to clean their line online eliminating downtime and production losses we offer this expertise from experience in more than  projects all around the world our patented chemical cleaning method makes use of specially formulated tensides to emulsify pipeline sediments rather than scraping them out with traditional mechanical devices the nspec® technology has successfully removed paraffin waxes black powder hydrates scales and sand and metal scraps both onshore and offshore application examples nspec® has been successfully applied in gas pipelines onshoreoffshore oil pipelines for crude and processed products onshoreoffshore product pipelines in refineries and petrochemical plants amine units in refineries glycol units in refineries barges and ships storage tanks and rail and road tankers turnkey services the nspec® package offered includes a team of experts providing full technical support cleaning chemicals and a maintenance program to satisfy your specific needs the package can also include geometric nspection of your pipeline advantages environmentally friendly technology less than half the cleaning time of conventional methods dramatically reduced disposal costs minimal personnel time
