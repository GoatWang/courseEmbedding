i will turn the call over to eddie eddie capel good afternoon everyone q has been an important quarter for manhattan associates we’ve accelerated our transition to the cloud and have the biggest and most innovative product release in the companys history manhattan active solutions while still early days the reception has been strong and we’re seeing positive encouraging impact in fact were ready in several meaningful discussions with customers and prospects globally about these new solutions while highly encouraging we do continue to manage our business strategically with a rigorous operational and financial focus and i’m pleased to say that our q results were solid improving sequentially although yearoveryear growth continues to be muted by macro retail challenges and while we remain cautious we are starting to see some stabilization in the services revenue as retailers invest in enterprise transformation all of our other financial metrics remain solid and we delivered record first half license revenue with promising pipeline activity for both license and services license revenue for the quarter was  million up  over the prior year emea operations had another terrific quarter delivering  million in license revenue on the heels of a strong q nonetheless our q services revenue was down  from prior year and in may we made the difficult decision to eliminate about  positions from the manhattan associates services business to align capacity with customer demand importantly though this action did not impair nor alter our strategic investment plans in innovation or in sales and marketing to increase market share and extend our competitive advantage in summary we delivered q total revenue of  million flat yearoveryear and  of adjusted eps up  over the prior year at competitive win rates in headtohead sales cycles against major competitors remain healthy at  plus for the quarter and were off to a very positive start in q as well we added several new large global brands to our customer portfolio closing four  million plus license deals in the quarter two with new customers and two with existing two of the large deals were here in the us and two in emea all four of the large deals were distribution management deals and two of the four deals were successful headtohead against very strong competition three of the large deals were in retail and one in automotive in q our license fee mix split roughly  to  between warehouse management and other solutions respectively the retail consumer goods and thirdparty logistics verticals were again as strong as license fee contributors making up more than half of our q license wins we are in advanced discussions with a number of customers and prospects about our new manhattan active omni offering which is extending sales cycles in a positive way enabling and driving the full evaluation of our new capabilities in technical architecture and finally as permitted by our customers our earnings press release highlights some of our q software license wins turning to services consulting revenue was down  against a record prior year comp but up sequentially by  from q  all regions improved sequentially with americas up  europe up  and apac up  and our consulting organization continues to execute well and remains focused on customer success globally we completed  systems go lives over the past  months and continue to receive high marks for our customers for the quarter we invested  million in research and development with nearly  associates dedicated to rd and our  plans continue to call for increased rd investment as previously mentioned we unveiled our manhattan active solutions at our annual customer conference in may marking the biggest launch of new capabilities in manhattans history our clients are under more pressure than ever to succeed in a digital first landscape that demands both process velocity and technological investments in new methods of omnichannel and agile supplychain solutions and our innovations focus directly on delivering against that acute need in a meaningful and competitively differentiated manner with manhattan active omni we’ve created the industrys first omnichannel operations platform that fully melds order management pointofsale client telling and store inventory and fulfillment into a single cloud native micro servicesbased application and the advantages of this new offering are certainly numerous but let me highlight just a few that we believe will be game changing for our customers first the overall solution is completely version less elastic and yet fully extensible for our customers this means that theyll have  always have access to our latest omnichannel applications with the freedom to fully extend the solution as they see fit and it will scale to the business needs season to season to that end we’re confident were bringing to market a platform for optimizing operations and service that allows our customers to innovate on top of our advantages there are no upgrade processes consuming time or resources so all of our customers focus investment can go into further advancing the platform secondly the solution is fully integrated with pointofsale order management and store inventory and fulfillment all delivered in a single application the platform delivers an integrated view of the customer inventory pricing and demand so there is zero data or process redundancy this combination application approach not only delivers a more holistic view of the customer and inventory to every customer facing associate it also enables customers to implement additional applications more quickly and costeffectively lowering our barriers to additional product sales and finally we believe manhattan active omni is an operational game changer for our customers with bricks and mortar and manhattan active store component of the suite creates a single unified experience for the store associate full access to selling service client telling fulfillment and inventory functions and now that application runs across all form factors in all operating platforms that you’re likely to find in a store literally the same code base could be applied on everything from an ipod touch to of  inch touch screen that the cash rep station that might be running windows and again all fully customizable to flex with the needs of our customers now turning to our supplychain applications we unveiled a substantial new capability called order streaming within our flagship warehouse management for open systems application order streaming is a major step forward for our warehouse operations customers because it takes in  it takes the socalled waveless concept to the next level some of our larger ecommerce shippers have been dabbling with outbound processes that stream orders to directly to flow throughout the day as opposed to batching them one or two ways throughout the day but order streaming takes that concept further to most efficiently drive more throughput in the distribution center improve speed of the distribution at early adopting customers are seeing double digits improvements in the overall facility volume and we believe there is much more that we can do in this area finally weve also made our inventory suite of applications available on a subscription basis for some of our smaller customers being able to subscribe to a fully managed and always uptodate leading solution is proving an attractive option in the early months since launch now turning to our global associates we ended q with about  employees around the globe down about  compared with q  and yearend  we finished the quarter with  people in sales and sales management with  quota carrying sales reps thats down three from last quarter and we will continue to be opportunistic and look to add talented sales professionals to the company over the balance of the year so that covers the business update dennis why don’t you provide the financial update and the up guidance and ill close with some prepared remarks in a brief summary dennis story okay thanks eddie we posted q total revenue of  million about flat with q of  consulting services revenue was down  muting solid license maintenance and hardware growth of  in each category on a geographic basis the americas total revenue declined  europe grew  and asia grew  sequentially from q total revenue grew  with operating profit and eps growing  and our consulting revenue also showed modest improvement on a sequential basis adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was  up  over prior year our gaap diluted earnings per share was  decreasing  on a charge of approximately  million in the quarter associated with the improved alignment of us services capacity with customer demand for your reference a detailed reconciliation of gaap to nongaap adjustments is included in our earnings release today license revenue for the quarter totaled  million growing  over prior year from a regional perspective americas posted license revenue of  million europe  million and asia  million as always our license performance depends heavily on the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter given the pipeline activity associated with manhattan active omni in the second half we are adjusting our perpetual license growth goal of  to  or  to   to  to  for the fullyear  our estimate change is based on our omni cloud pipeline activity factoring in the potential transition impact from onpremise software to cloudbased subscription revenue while the metrics are not material at this stage customer interest is certainly increasing and expected to continue on this manner through the remainder of  also included in our forecast is  of yearoveryear fx headwinds shifting to services q services revenue totaled  million down  over prior year and up  sequentially our services revenue is comprised of two revenue streams consulting and maintenance our  estimate for total services revenue growth including maintenance reflects a decline of  to  we are estimating q services revenue to be down about  our maintenance growth included in these estimates for quarterly and fullyear remains at about  in summary despite our strong second half  license growth and solid start to  we expect services revenue growth to decline modestly in the second half consulting revenue for the quarter totaled  million down  compared to prior year and up  sequentially from q  snapping three consecutive quarters of sequential decline americas was up sequentially  but down  over prior year europe and apac are trending positively with europe flat over prior year and up  sequentially apac was up  over prior year and up  sequentially americas continues to be the most challenged geography with growth headwinds were seeing signs of stabilization with services sales efforts building pipeline strong license performance with services attached and the momentum spread of customer engagements declining versus advancing over the past trailing  months is narrowing all said we are positive but remain cautious given the retail environment timing is also being impacted by our manhattan solutions launch regarding customer evaluations maintenance revenue for the quarter totaled  million increasing  over last year on strong collections license revenue growth cash collections and retention rates of  plus contributed to this yearoveryear growth consolidated services margins for the quarter were  which exceeded our expectations benefiting from solid productivity and capacity management we expect q  services margins will likely be in the range of  to  and our fullyear  services margins to normalize into the  to  range we expect q margins to increase as billability and utilization ramp then drop off again in q due to regular holiday seasonality turning to operating income and margins q adjusted operating income totaled  yes totaled  million with an operating margin of  up sequentially from  in q and down slightly from  in q  our operating leverage is being driven by strong license revenue performance workforce productivity expense discipline and lower incentive compensation accruals associated with revenue performance our fullyear operating income estimate range is  million to  million with an operating margin target at  to  versus the previous goal of  to  this includes five of the  million in incremental strategic investment largely tied to incremental rd resources and investment in cloud operations the lower investment is timing related and will straddle into  we expect the q operating margin range of  to  with second half operating margin in the range of  to  the second half quarterly split should be adjusted for quarterly license seasonality and lower q services revenue due to the traditional retail holiday season so that covers the operating results regarding taxes our adjusted effective income tax rate was  for q and we continue to project a fullyear effective tax rate of  for adjusted earnings per share for gaap new accounting rules related to taxes associated with vesting restricted stock will lower our  gaap effective taxes  tax rate to  diluted shares for the quarter totaled  million shares down from q  a  million shares we repurchased about  shares of common stock in the quarter totaling  million we estimate second half diluted shares to be about  million for q and q and the fullyear weighted average diluted shares to be about  million the estimate does not assume additional common stock repurchases and lastly on shares our board approved last week raising our share repurchase authority limit to a total of  million that covers the pl results turning to cash flow cash flow from operations was  million in q  compared to  million in q  with the change driven by higher income tax payments in  yeartodate operating cash flow totaled  million up  over prior year dsos were  days versus  days in q  capex was  million in the quarter and we estimate fullyear  capex to be about  million to  million our balance sheet also continues to support stability and longterm strategic flexibility with cash and investments totaling  million as of june  and zero debt compared to  million reported for q  now ill update our  guidance and then hand the call back to eddie for closing remarks while it will take time to build subscription revenue we are factoring in potential second half impact on our revenue and earnings based on positive customer interest in pipeline activity the top end of our guidance range for revenue and earnings assumes performance is weighted to our traditional onprem business with license maintenance and services and the lowend assumes the positive impact of uptick on our cloud solutions with ratable revenue recognition and potential services revenue deferral until customer go live with recognition over the remaining term of the customer contract with that backdrop we are lowering our fullyear total revenue guidance to a range of  million to  million from our previous range of  million to  million the highend of the new range accounts for our services headwinds and manhattan active omni subscription deals at the lowend of the new range we expect our fullyear total revenue percentage split to be about  first half versus second half with the q holiday season as in prior years we are modeling a sequential decline in services revenue of about  from q  to q  for adjusted diluted earnings per share we are lowering our guidance range from a  to a  to a  to a  representing a range of down  to up plus  over  adjusted eps of a  we expect our fullyear percentage eps split to be  first half versus second half for gaap diluted earnings per share we now expect to deliver  to a  representing a range of down  to up  over  gaap eps of a  finally with our move to the cloud we expect to achieve longterm financial results exceeding but would have been possible under a standalone onpremise license model our transition will have a meaningful impact on the shape of our pl and results in  and beyond so in our q call we will provide more details regarding our outlook now ill turn the call back to eddie eddie capel thanks dennis well i will close our prepared remarks with a brief conclusion as success continues to be driven by the focus we apply to delivering innovation in a rapid and everchanging market focusing on customer success and leveraging our deep domain expertise while the global and retail macroeconomic condition certainly give us reason to be cautious we’re very bullish on the market opportunity ahead of us and investing significant energy and capital into innovation and advancing the worlds leading suite of supplychain commerce solutions so as to extent our market leadership in  and beyond omnichannel retail commerce and supply chain complexity in our target markets continue to increase driven by digitalization and ecommerce which continue fueling multiyear investment cycles for customers and for manhattan associates our competitive position continues to be very strong and we continue to invest in innovation to extend our addressable market market leadership and differentiation with the worlds most talented supplychain employees the best software solutions and market dynamics that require customers to adapt and invest in supplychain innovation we believe we are well positioned for  and beyond jessie wed now be happy to take any questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of terry tillman with suntrust please go ahead mr tillman your line is open terry tillman hey good afternoon gentlemen eddie capel hi terry terry tillman thanks for all the color on the call and its good to hear about active omni seeing some strong new interest i guess eddie i have a question for you and then i’ve two followups for dennis first eddie for you in terms of active omni just maybe a little bit more narrative in terms of  and i know its still early but do you sense it all by all the capabilities or would it be more bits and pieces and i guess related to that what kind of deal sizes would you see versus your other traditional products and just how do you see it playing out in terms of deal sizes and how they consume it eddie capel lets see so i think first of all its  as i think its a modular suite of solutions with great potential for upsell in the eight months indiscernible quarters and out years i think that our prospects will buy  will not buy typically the entire suite of solutions all at once certainly it will happen from time to time but dont expect that to happen all at once in terms of the deal size i think that  the deal size will continue to be as it has been and not really change materially we will obviously see some upside from the infrastructure that  infrastructure cost that will be in control of in in the new world but i think the deal will be consistent with what we are seeing the way that our customers and prospects consume obviously will be different and expect that as dennis said to largely be ratable over the term of the deal terry tillman okay and i guess well actually just as a followup to that eddie do you see anything in terms of active omni changing kind of the mix of business of attracting net new customers versus whats been typically the balance weve seen of new versus existing eddie capel i dont think so terry sure again its early but given the response that we’ve seen in the marketplace both from existing customers and new i think the mix will be consistent terry tillman okay and dennis maybe the question its actually on the combined services line so first maintenance revenue we get calls from clients wondering with the retail exposure if you would see any kind of impact to both maintenance renewal rates collections etcetera but the firm is actually quite strong and the growth was solid in maintenance revenue are you forecasting anything in the back half of the year or any changing patterns still in terms of retailers balking at maintenance or price increases etcetera eddie capel not at all terry tillman okay that was clear and then just the second part of the services line in terms of confidence in services stabilizing i mean the rate of decline definitely improved from the first quarter you’ve mentioned something about advancers versus decliners can you maybe walk through what you mean andor the visibility or confidence in further stabilization in the second half and thanks for taking my questions dennis story yes so advance or decline is really a momentum view that we take on the services and on a trailing month basis in any  at any given time you can have anywhere from  to  customer  unique customers and active engagement so our view is that looking at from an advance or decliner point of view and the spread between advancers and decliners on dollars gives a give us  gives us a perspective of how is the business firming up or not so  and weve seen  we’ve seen that spread narrowing which is a positive sign looking forward the services teams been working very diligent  very diligently around selling services and expanding their services buying we’re seeing some nice traction on the pipeline itself its growing but unfortunately since were getting into the back half of the year some of that will we may realize in  but most of the manifest itself in  does that help terry terry tillman yes it does thanks operator your next question comes from monika garg with keybanc market capital your line is open monika garg hi thanks for taking my question first question what i’m trying to understanding if i look the license growth first half about ish whereas professional services is down  to  so what i’m trying to understand why there is disconnect between the growth of license and the declining surveys and going forward how do you think these two trend dennis story yes so monika this is dennis typically the services attached okay it all depends on when the customer drives the implementation cycle and generally start out with the design elements so theres always a lag typically on the front end from services attached and when you look at the past trailing  months license has been very strong and were seeing better services attached with respect to the last four quarters but we also have had the lead out of some larger engagements that we had signed in   multiyear engagements so basically that trailing month advancer decline or that i mentioned in what were working hard to do diligently is filled the bucket back up and narrow that spread between engagements that are going wide and generating positive roi in the new business or bringing in the door monika garg got it then as you talked about seeing interest in active omni solutions so as that business  that line ramps how do you think it could impact the service revenue for next couple of years eddie capel we will talk more its certainly days we will talk more about that in q and how its going to shape the pl keep in mind for the most of part we’ve been going to market with the product i’m going to market with the product i’m going to over exaggerate here little bit but since june and i think the feedback from prospects has been pretty exciting and i’m gauging that by the activity in the pipeline and eddie can talk about that but what we know is for the active omni implementations we will have to basically defer services revenue until go live and then we can recognize that revenue over the balance of the remaining contract term with the customer so we will have some impact initially as we transition to cloud on the services growth line in the pl and well talk more about that in q and as we go along monika garg okay and last one for me do you think youll have to invest more in sales and marketing as you ramp active omni solutions thank you eddie capel i don’t think so monika we certainly allowed as we’ve talked about before some additional strategic investment and awareness in marketing as we bring our new solutions to the segments but nothing above and beyond the investments we’ve already highlighted from a marketing perspective from a sales  quarter carrying sales rep prospective we feel pretty comfortable about where we’re we will continue to look opportunistically to add heads to our organization but nothing  not an order of magnitude to increase or anything like that monika garg thank you eddie capel certainly operator your next question comes from mark schappel with benchmark your line is open mark schappel hi good evening thanks for taking my question maybe starting with you in your prepared remarks you noted that you’re transitioned to the cloud was accelerating in the quarter and just wondering is it fair to assume that that transition took place mostly on the transportation side of your business eddie capel historically yes mark but  so that was  that’s really what i meant by the acceleration so as you know we’ve had a transportation cloud business for a number of years now but pretty much all of our other solutions order management pointofsale wm and so on down the line we’ve been delivering exclusively as a perpetual license model as we launch our active suite of solutions we certainly expect to see and are seeing more of products over and above tms being consumed on a subscription basis mark schappel so that the two new solutions your active solutions and active omni there are being offered only on a subscription basis or is that more of a hybrid model eddie capel both so to be clear our active omni solution is a true native pure play whatever adjective you want to use cloud  cloud solution the interesting thing i think about our offering is we will deliver it as a perpetual license model as well so there have been active at customer type model if you  if it that makes sense so either subscription or perpetual mark schappel great thank you and then dennis cash flow from operations was down meaningfully this quarter yearoveryear where there any onetime items that wont appear or what we appear that drove that number or and do you expect cash flow from ops to bounce back next quarter dennis story yes so mark we’ve always looked at cash flow on a yeartodate basis throughout the year the only meaningful impact in the quarter was we paid  million in income taxes which was up significantly over the last year last year was about  million of the income tax payments that’s the primary difference but if you like at yearoveryear yeartodate cash flow we generated roughly  million up  yeartodate so yes i would expect that  will have a nice cash flow profile in the back of the year as well mark schappel great thanks operator your next question comes from matt pfau with william blair your line is open matthew pfau hey guys thanks for taking my questions but first i wanted to dig in a little bit more into the guidance change for revenue i guess what changed in terms of your expectations versus when you reported your last quarter whether deals or engagements that were delayed that you were expecting to come back and now theyre going to be pushed out further or is it something in the pipeline in terms of anticipated deals that hasnt been building as expected eddie capel yes i will take that matt first off in our guidance in last quarter we didn’t factor anything for active omni so number one we werent baking any assumptions into our guidance from the beginning of the year through last quarter relative to active omni secondly the services revenue line while its improving sequentially in the back half its better than the first half it didn’t improve its not an accelerating or improving as fast as we would like so the good news is we arent seeing a meaningful work stoppage on services engagement we are just  we are seeing more of a timing on restarts some restarts matthew pfau got it and then i guess in terms of eddie some comments on the press release about how you expect some of the retail headwinds going on right now to eventually produce some nice growth opportunities for manhattan i guess what does it take to sort of put that switchgear we stop seeing some of these delayed services engagement and it starts potential actually maybe driving a bit of an investment cycle in manhattans products eddie capel yes i think what we’ve  we still got this essentially the polls in the retail industry going on whilst the landscape their portfolio in the landscape gets reconstituted and rebalanced between digital and bricks and mortar and retailers still  are frankly redesigning to some extent their networks their bricks and mortar portfolios and again the balance between digital and bnm and when we see that those strategic decisions being completed i think that the reinvestment and reinvigoration in either and or in both in supplychain transformation and in the technology enablement of the stores is what is  what will drive some nice upside for us there matthew pfau got it and then on the active omni solution and the interest youre seeing i think correct me if im wrong but theres kind of four different ways that you could combinations of how you could purchase and deploy the solution between subscription license and then onpremise or cloud so what areas you sort of been seeing these most interest in there and i guess is there a certain type of customer that fits in better with the certain type of combination eddie capel yes so a pretty good mix inside of all of those permutations almost all of them have a flavor of cloud whether public or private if you push  may i probably tell you that the larger tier  customers are running in either public or private clouds but would like to consumer the license as perpetual and then slightly smaller customers bear in mind we deal in t t or so that’s still precise of the customers but are more interested in consuming the solution on a subscription basis matthew pfau got it and then last one for me just in terms of traction with the pointofsale solution what are you seeing there and then does the active omni solution help potential accelerate adoption of that product eddie capel yes so good progress there just went live actually with one of their early adopter customers just days ago frankly so pleased with that that seems to be going well in in the early days our pipeline is pretty solid a good bit of activity in that space for sure i think that the active platform and the native cloud platform certainly has garnered a more interest and i want to be cautious using the word accelerate i don’t think its going to create a hockey stick acceleration but i do think it is going to make a solution more and more attractive to enter the marketplace because frankly it is the first and only of it s kind matthew pfau great thanks guys for taking my questions eddie capel pleasure matt operator your next question comes from brian peterson with raymond james your line is open brian peterson good evening gentlemen thanks for taking the questions so maybe a highlevel question if we look at your active solution portfolio then how should we think about the dollar opportunity of services versus some of your current products in the reduction in service capacity is that solely related to the retail spending environment or is that any reflection of what services could look like with the new product portfolio eddie capel indiscernible i will take that brian so the services  the services engagement whether it would be kind of the older if you want to call it that onpremise solution or active cloud based solutions really look very very similar clearly there are some very idiosyncratic differences between the technology deployment and so forth but the services engagement looks very very similar now if the client our client is signed up for cloud based solution at dennis pointed at the revenue recognition rules say that we cannot begin to recognize services revenue until that customer goes live in the old world we would recognize services revenue from day one on the time of material basis so there will be a lag in terms of picking up that revenue and then the balance of the services revenue is recognized over the term of the contract so that is definitely different for sure and then with regard to the your part b of the question which was the reduction in services capacity related to retail headwinds and the answer to that is yes so most exclusively a not representative as i pointed out in part a of a transition to the cloud brian peterson got it makes sense and i’m sorry for the background noise here and maybe one more for you eddie just on the back line there is a lot of news and what’s going on in retail i’m just curious is there any way to bifurcate what the sales pipeline looks like if we look at retail and nonretail thanks guys eddie capel well there is we don’t disclose that but obviously we’ve got a view of that i would tell you though the  and we talk about retail being pretty strong for us and so forth retail pipeline looks good its really the big transformational services projects that have been going for    months where we’ve seem a bit of a slow down and created the headwind in services the retail pipeline is really quite active both here in the united states and internationally brian peterson thanks indiscernible eddie capel certainly brian operator there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back to presenters eddie capel very good thank you jesse and thank you everybody for taking the time to join us this afternoon and your continued support to manhattan associates that we look forward to updating you on  particularly our active suite of
