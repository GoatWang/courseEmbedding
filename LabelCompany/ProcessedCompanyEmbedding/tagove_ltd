read live chat platform tagove helps businesses answer customer queries in real time sindhu kashyap  march  shares tagove is a live chat software that provides video chat voice calling and text chat with cobrowsing and screen sharing with the customer consumers today are not just looking for a seamless experience but expect a proactive response and a relationship with brands products or services there is a need for urgency in terms of response time that consumers look atit was something that laduram vishnoi amritpal dhangal and sawaram suthar realised when they started their software and app development companies just total tech while working at these companies they encountered several problems in terms of customer communicationthe tagove team solving the response lag timethey realised that the lead time to response needed to be shorter and there was a need for instant communication “we came across many ideas that could remove instant communication gap between customers and companies though basic chat software was present for a long time the time taken to solve small customer queries was long” says laduramthat’s when the trio felt the need for a product that integrated chat video text and voice calling with cobrowsing and screen sharing with the customer they then went on to develop live chat software tagove in the idea behind tagove is to ensure the resolution of customer queries as quickly as possible this can happen when a customer agent can talk over phone or video and if need be even take over a customer’s screen for cobrowsing so as to help him instantly rather than downloading all the remote access software the team and productafter running the trial and beta version of the software the team was able to bring on board a few clients with whom they could partner and launch the software the platform is sector agnostic and works on ecommerce saas business financial institutions or any possible marketplace“at present we are total  people including the development and the sales team we have four offices worldwide the headquarters is in san francisco the sales office is in london development marketing and support offices are in ahmedabad” says laduramspeaking of the challenges the team faced laduram says the biggest one pertained to how to manage live chat especially without downloading any thirdparty software or plugins the system provides multichannel support including text chat video calling cobrowsing and screen sharing it also has voip call facility for those who want to call the customers directly says laduram“after going through intense research work we have designed our live chat software with the latest technologies having seven years of longterm experience in software development we have learned a lot of new technologies like webrtc nodejs which ultimately helped me to set up a product company”the chat spacecurrently the startup ecosystem is witnessing the growth of chatbased customer services for instance in the financial services there are robo advisory services that are looking at chat bots especially for customer care in china one of the biggest players is wechat smartphone users spend a chunk of their time on chat applications such as whatsapp facebook  messenger hike and wechat whatsapp has one billion monthly active users messenger has  million and wechat  million the limitations with humanbased chat is that all agents cannot perform up to the level of best agentstagove however is different compared to the others who provide only basic chat features tagove offers video chat voice calling cobrowsing and screen sharing all at once it’s a fullstack customer support softwarethe team follows a licensebased business model and now claims to have over  paid customers like citibank citibank penske icici prolife insurance india amagi india hyundai aster pharmacy india and uae etc “we are growing at a high rate of  percent more paid customers every month” says laduram apart from the initial investment from family and friends tagove has received funding from  startups an earlystage venture fund and seed accelerator the team now claims to be working with artificial intelligence ai and chatbot systems where customers can get help automatically if ai can’t figure out what customers are asking then they have the video chat or voice calling optionswebsite shares calling all tech
