may exist rating scale commercial paper and shortterm debtedit the dbrs shortterm debt rating scale provides an opinion on the risk that an issuer will not meet its shortterm financial obligations in a timely manner ratings are based on quantitative and qualitative considerations relevant to the issuer and the relative ranking of claims the r and r rating categories are further denoted by the subcategories “high” “middle” and “low” r high highest credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is exceptionally high unlikely to be adversely affected by future events r middle superior credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is very high differs from r high by a relatively modest degree unlikely to be significantly vulnerable to future events r low good credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is substantial overall strength is not as favourable as higher rating categories may be vulnerable to future events but qualifying negative factors are considered manageable r high upper end of adequate credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is acceptable may be vulnerable to future events r middle adequate credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is acceptable may be vulnerable to future events or may be exposed to other factors that could reduce credit quality r low lower end of adequate credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is acceptable may be vulnerable to future events a number of challenges are present that could affect the issuer’s ability to meet such obligations r lowest end of adequate credit quality there is a capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due may be vulnerable to future events and the certainty of meeting such obligations could be impacted by a variety of developments r speculative credit quality the capacity for the payment of shortterm financial obligations as they fall due is uncertain r highly speculative credit quality there is a high level of uncertainty as to the capacity to meet shortterm financial obligations as they fall due d a financial obligation has not been met or it is clear that a financial obligation will not be met in the near future or a debt instrument has been subject to a distressed exchange a downgrade to d may not immediately follow an
