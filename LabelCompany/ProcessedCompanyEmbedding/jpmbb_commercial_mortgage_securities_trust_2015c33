interest rate environment by analyzing sensitivity to increased interest rates rating sensitivities for this transaction fitchs net cash flow ncf was  below the most recent net operating income noi for properties for which a recent noi was provided excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period unanticipated further declines in propertylevel ncf could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to jpmbb c certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in ncf in a scenario in which ncf declined a further  from fitchs ncf a downgrade of the senior aaasf certificates to bbbsf could result in a more severe scenario in which ncf declined a further  from fitchs ncf a downgrade of the senior aaasf certificates to bbbsf could result the presale report includes a detailed explanation of
