income or loss as a measure of the companys operating performance ffo affo ebitda and adjusted ebitda as calculated by the company may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the company ffo the company calculates ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit nareit defines ffo as net income loss calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property plus real estate related depreciation depletion and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management presents ffo as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that ffo is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the companys operational performance specifically in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance ffo provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs the company also believes that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare the companys operating performance with that of other reits however other equity reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as the company does and accordingly the companys ffo may not be comparable to such other reits ffo affo the company calculates affo by adjusting ffo to exclude the income and expenses that the company believes are not reflective of the sustainability of the companys ongoing operating performance including but not limited to real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs and stockbased compensation for this quarter excluded expenses include the payments related to the prudential subadvisory agreement and corresponding termination payment as well as acquisition and due diligence costs in connection with the closing of the afco merger changes in gaap accounting and reporting rules that were put in effect after the establishment of nareits definition of ffo in  result in the inclusion of a number of items in ffo that do not correlate with the sustainability of the companys operating performance  therefore in addition to ffo the company presents affo and affo per share fully diluted both of which are nongaap measures  management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the companys operational performance than ffo affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of the companys operating performance even affo however does not properly capture the timing of cash receipts especially in connection with fullyear rent payments under lease agreements entered into in connection with newly acquired farms management considers affo per share fully diluted to be a supplemental metric to gaap earnings per share affo per share fully diluted provides additional insight into how the companys operating performance could be allocated to potential shares outstanding at a specific point in time management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess the companys performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and affo per share fully diluted and accordingly the companys affo and affo per share fully diluted may not always be comparable to affo and affo per share amounts calculated by other reits affo and affo per share fully diluted should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to net income loss earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the companys liquidity nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the companys cash needs including its ability to make distributions ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a key financial measure used to evaluate the companys operating performance but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income cash flows from operating activities or net income in each case as determined in accordance with gaap the company believes that ebitda is a standard performance measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts and investors in the companys industry however while ebitda is a performance measure widely used across several industries the company does not believe that it correctly captures the companys business operating performance because it includes noncash expenses and recurring adjustments that are necessary to better understand the companys business operating performance  therefore in addition to ebitda management uses adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure the company calculates adjusted ebitda by adjusting ebitda for certain items such as stockbased compensation and real estate related acquisition and due diligence costs that the company considers necessary to understand its operating performance the company believes that adjusted ebitda provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the companys ongoing operating performance that when considered with net income and ebitda is beneficial to an investors understanding of the companys operating performance however ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the companys results as reported under gaap net operating income the company calculates net operating income as total operating revenues rental income tenant reimbursements and other revenue less property operating expenses property expenses and real estate taxes since net operating income excludes general and administrative expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization acquisitionrelated expenses other income and losses and extraordinary items it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and leasing farmland real estate providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income however net operating income should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization costs other income and losses   to view the original version on pr newswire
