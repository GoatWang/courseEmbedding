disclosures  definitions see the prospectus for a more detailed description of fund risks investing involves risk principal loss is possible the funds shares will not be listed on an exchange in the foreseeable future if at all it is not anticipated that a secondary market for the shares will develop unless the shares are listed on an exchange thus an investment in the fund is not suitable for investors who might need access to the money they invest for several years or longer the fund may decline to accept any subscription requests for any reason regardless of the order in which such subscription request was submitted to the fund in a particular subscription period if a borrower is unable to make its payments on a loan the fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal and interest under such loan as among other reasons the fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated the loan may be unsecured or undercollateralized andor it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower the marketplace lending instruments in which the fund may invest will not typically be guaranteed or insured by any thirdparty and will not typically be backed by any governmental authority prospective borrowers supply a variety of information regarding the purpose of the loan income occupation and employment status as applicable to the lending platforms as a general matter platforms do not verify the majority of this information which may be incomplete inaccurate false or misleading prospective borrowers may misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms including their intentions for the use of the loan proceeds marketplace lending instruments are generally not rated by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros such unrated instruments may be comparable in quality to securities falling into any of the ratings categories used by such nrsros accordingly certain of the funds unrated investments could constitute a highly risky and speculative investment similar to an investment in junk bonds the marketplace lending instruments in which the fund may invest may have varying degrees of credit risk and the fund will not be restricted by any borrower credit criteria or credit risk limitation there can be no assurance that payments due on underlying marketplace loans will be made at any given time the funds portfolio may be substantially illiquid and subject to increased credit and default risk the shares therefore should be purchased only by investors who could afford the loss of the entire amount of their investment the companys fees and expenses may be considered high and as a result such fees and expenses may offset the companys profits a portion of the investments executed for the company may take place in foreign markets as a result of the foregoing and other risks described in this prospectus an investment in the fund is considered to be highly speculative diversification does not ensure a profit or a guarantee against loss  the fund is classified as nondiversified which means the fund may invest a larger percentage of its assets in the securities of a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund investment in securities of a limited number of issuers exposes the fund to greater market risk and potential losses than if its assets were diversified among the securities of a greater number of issuers  duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed income investment to a change in interest rates duration is expressed
