valuemarketplacereit beatsummaryas in any investment opportunity it’s critical to dig deep into the motives of the management teamremember that arct was aggregating capital using its nontraded reit platform so essentially the investors were paying  and only around  was being invested in the real estateso now we have a new reit afin hoping to crank up yet another round of musical chairsthe stage is set for another round of financial engineering except this time the magician is not around for the final liquidity eventwow time flies just over  ½ year ago i wrote my first article on american realty capital properties arcp i cant believe how the time went by so fast and i can never forget the composition of the portfolio at the time of the ipo i explained it like this the biggest issue that i have with the ipo is that the assets are highly concentrated with just two tenants and one of the two tenants is a troubled bank with minimum lease term remaining some may recall that arcp commenced with just two tenants  home depot nysehd and citizens financial group nysecfg thats not that big of a deal though my biggest concern however was the fact that the management team led by nicholas schorsch was seeding the initial portfolio with properties that he owned solely because his predecessor company was being forced to pay off the debt coming due ive never been a fan for owning bank branches i used to travel to my bank a few times a month now i may go inside a few times a year at the time of the arcp ipo the bank branches had a weighted lease term of  years now  ½ years have burned off so the citizens bank properties should have just over two years remaining according to my calculations i summed up my frustration in an article i wrote on arcp over  years ago arcps  dividend sounds good on paper but an investor should always peel back the onion and understand the true meaning of the assets and the metrics that are driving the value creation strategies as in any investment opportunity its critical to dig deep into the motives of the management team ask yourself what is management doing for me and does managements interest align with mine now lets begin with another reit called american… american finance trust inc on april th new yorkbased american realty capital trust v said it filed an application to list its common stock on the nyse and concurrent with the listing it intends to launch a tender offer and change its name to american finance trust inc anticipated ticker is afin source snl financial subject to the approval from the exchange afin expects its common stock to begin trading on the nyse during the third quarter upon listing arcts ceo and president william kahane notified the company of his resignation and nicholas radesca notified the board of his resignation as the cfo secretary and treasurer the companys board appointed donald mackinnon as the ceo and president effective as of may  in addition the company named donald ramon as cfo secretary and treasurer he will also serve as the cfo secretary and treasurer of american realty capital advisor v inc ramon previously served as cfo of invesco mortgage capital inc nyseivr andrew winer was appointed as the companys chief investment officer effective may  ubs securities llc is acting as a financial adviser in connection with the listing rcs capital the investment banking and capital markets division of realty capital securities llc is also advising the company in connection with the listing in case you dont remember arct is a nontraded reit and the th in a vintage of illiquid funds created by schrosch with the name american the first was arct that was sold to realty income nyseo the second and third  arct there was never an arct and arct was sold to arcp also remember that arcp acquired cole a nontraded reit and in addition to arct  and  several other companies and portfolios caplease inland ge capital and fortress im fairly confident that it was schorschs intent to monetize arct by using the arcp vehicle however given the fact that schorsch is out and arcp is out of business as it relates to acquisitions the new reit  so named american finance trust  had no way to create liquidity than to create another reit… but this one is different a triple net hybrid arct said it intends to commence a tender offer to purchase up to  million of its shares of common stock subject to the listing and the filing of appropriate offering materials with the sec the tender offer would commence concurrently with or shortly following the listing in accordance with the terms of the tender offer the company will offer to repurchase shares of its common stock at a purchase price of  per share assuming that trading of the companys common stock begins during the third quarter the tender offer would also commence on the same day as the listing and will expire  business days afterwards unless the company decides to extend the offer period further the company plans to expand its investment focus from net lease real estate to include originating and acquiring first mortgages and other commercial real estate debt securities seems like a hybrid of sorts its clear to me that new afin management team is hoping to provide some unique operating model in which it can show the market that the company is truly unique not competing with arcp if you recall arcp started its pitch by telling investors that it was going to own midterm really shortterm leases primarily because the bank leases referenced above were midduration later arcp opted to modify its pitch its interesting not logical to see afin moving into a space in which it hopes to compete with the net lease reits as well as the commercial mortgage reits this reminds me of the same anchor and buoy model that arcp touted a while back  just another seemingly sucker yielding approach to financial engineering in which it blends bondlike net lease exposure with higher risk commercial paper before i rip the new venture into shreds lets take a closer look arct intends to expand its business from around  billion to around  billion by combining the existing arct assets afin hopes to aggregate debt obligations to balance the portfolio with a proforma debt  asset percentage of around  x to x debtequity once afin hits  billion in assets heres how the company will compare to the peer group its really interesting to see net lease reits and commercial mortgage reits in the same peer group these two asset classes are opposites and by combining low risk and high risk afin plans to create a business model with shareholders equity of around  billion afin management projects the dividend yield to be somewhere between  and  heres how that compares to the commercial mortgage peer group there are solid players in the commercial mortgage space today and i dont see any unique investment banking model with afin i understand the opportunity to seize market share as a result of constrained bank lending new frank dodd regulation however im not sure how a net lease reit can flip a switch and decide to go head to head with the big boys nrf bxmt and stwd in fact i believe the commercial mortgage reit model will be similar to the banking model in other words i see the opportunity for a few superregional players like nrf and bxmt and more localized players like udf and loan im not feeling the attraction for a middle market player that also owns net lease that model seems silly the net lease portfolio the more i ponder the new reit offering the more i become fixated on arcps ipo over  years ago arct has  properties that comprise of  million square feet the portfolio is  occupied and it should be since the properties were acquired over the last  years with a weighted average lease term of  years the portfolio is  investment grade now lets examine the portfolio you can now see why im reminiscing about the arcp ipo as you can see arcts top tenant is suntrust banks nysesti there are  bank branches that represent around  of arcts revenue remember that arct was aggregating capital using its nontraded reit platform so essentially the investors were paying  and only around  was being invested in the real estate  load paid to brokers etc so when arct purchased the suntrust portfolio from inland american real estate trust it was essentially overpaying by  since inland had acquired the properties using  load and then arct charged its investors another   essentially making the portfolio  more expensive because of the fees paid to brokers so now we have a new reit pendingafin hoping to crank up yet another round of musical chairs clearly theres not enough meat on the bone for another existing reit to buy the bank assets so the new reit deal may be the only way for the company to create liquidity for investors the stage is set for another round of financial engineering except this time the magician is not around for the final liquidity event does that mean that afin could become the next american financial realty trust a similar reit started by schorsch in  that later became a bomb likewise there are many similarities to american realty capital properties and american finance trust both have the name american both invest in net lease assets both were started by nicholas schorsch both paid or will pay monthly dividends arcp suspended its dividend both commenced with a legacy portfolio of shortduration bank leases whats different the magician is not around and the music is almost over by disguising afin as a commercial mortgage reit the management team is hoping to create a differentiated vehicle that can last…i dont feel the love be careful with this one the thrill of victory may not be worth the agony of defeat source arct presentation
