futures premier abingdon lp  k  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoverview the partnership through its investment in the master aims to achieve substantial capital appreciation through speculative trading directly and indirectly in us and international markets for currencies interest rates stock indices softs agricultural and energy products and precious and base metals the partnership through its investment in the master may employ futures options on futures forward and swap contracts in those markets the general partner manages all business of the partnership and the master the general partner has delegated its responsibility for the investment of the partnerships assets to the advisor the partnership has invested these assets in the master the general partner engages a team of approximately  professionals whose primary emphasis is on attempting to maintain quality control among the advisors to the funds operated or managed by the general partner a fulltime staff of due diligence professionals uses proprietary technology and onsite evaluations to identify select and monitor new and existing futures money managers the accounting and operations staff provide processing of subscriptions and redemptions and reporting to limited partners and regulatory authorities the general partner also engages staff involved in marketing and sales support in selecting the advisor for the partnershipmaster the general partner considered among other things past performance trading style volatility of markets traded and fee requirements the general partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the advisor at any time responsibilities of the general partner include • due diligence examinations of the advisor • selection appointment and termination of the advisor • negotiation of the management agreement and • monitoring the activity of the advisor in addition the general partner prepares or assists the administrator in preparing the books and records and provides or assists the administrator in providing the administrative and compliance services that are required by law or regulation from time to time in connection with the operation of the partnershipmaster   while the partnership and the master have the right to seek lower commission rates and fees from other commodity brokers at any time the general partner believes that the customer agreements and other arrangements with the commodity broker are fair reasonable and competitive the partnerships assets allocated to the advisor for trading are not invested in commodity interests directly the advisors allocation of the partnerships assets is currently invested in the master the advisor trades the masters and thereby the partnerships assets in accordance with its winton futures program a proprietary systematic trading system the investment objective of the winton futures program is to achieve longterm capital appreciation through compound growth by pursuing diversified investment strategies subject to certain investment constraints these constraints may be imposed by the advisor or may be required by regulations or rules the key investment constraint of the winton futures program as applied to the partnership through its investment in the master is that it does not invest in equities although it may gain indirect exposure to equity markets via investments in equity index futures it may invest long and short using leverage in nonequity markets that the advisor believes are sufficiently liquid and for which there is sufficient data available the winton futures program is subject to a longterm gross volatility target of  the winton futures program currently invests in over  futures markets currency forwards and related instruments the advisor generally expects the holding periods for the winton futures programs portfolio to be longterm with the average holding period across all instruments expected to be  months the winton futures program follows a disciplined investment process that is based on statistical analysis of past data the initial stage of the process involves collecting cleaning and organizing large amounts of data the winton futures program uses a wide variety of data inputs including factors that are intrinsic to markets such as price volume and open interest and those that are external to markets such as economic statistics industrial and commodity data and public company financial data the advisor conducts statistical research into the data in an attempt to quantify the probability of particular markets rising or falling conditional on a variety of quantifiable factors the advisors research is used to develop mathematical models that attempt to forecast market returns the variability or volatility associated with such returns often described as risk correlation between markets and transaction costs these forecasts are used in investment strategies that determine what positions should be held to maximize profit within a certain range of risk as a result of the advisors research the advisor expects that the investments made in accordance with this process will have an improved chance of being successful which is expected to lead to profits over the longterm the advisors investment strategies are operated as an automated computerbased system this system is modified over time as the advisor monitors its operation and undertakes further research changes to the system occur as a result of amongst other things the discovery of new relationships changes in market liquidity the availability of new data or the reinterpretation of existing data most of the advisors investment decisions are made strictly in accordance with the output of the system however the advisor may in exceptional circumstances such as the occurrence of events that fall outside the input parameters of the system make investment decisions based on other factors and take action to override the output of the system to seek to protect the interests of investors for example if there is a market crash or if trading is suspended on a market or exchange the advisor may attempt to reduce risk by decreasing leverage or liquidating or hedging positions in certain markets   the advisor does not take any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the contents of this document any representations made herein or the performance of the partnershipmaster the advisor disclaims any liability for any direct indirect consequential or other losses or damages including loss of profits incurred by limited partners or by any third party that may arise from any reliance on this document the advisor is neither responsible for nor involved in the marketing distribution or sales of shares or interests in the partnership and is not responsible for compliance with any marketing or promotion laws rules or regulations and no third party other than the advisor is authorized to make any statement about any of the advisors products or services in connection with any such marketing distribution or sales past performance by any other fund advised by the advisor is not indicative of any future performance by the partnershipmaster a liquidity the partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services its only assets are its investment in the master and cash the master does not engage in sales of goods of services the masters only assets are its equity in its trading accounts consisting of cash and cash margin net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in us treasury bills if applicable because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the partnership through its investment in the master while substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity no such illiquidity occurred during the year ended december     to minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits the master follows certain trading policies including i the master invests its assets only in commodity interests that the advisor believes are traded in sufficient volume to permit ease of taking and liquidating positions sufficient volume in this context refers to a level of liquidity that the advisor believes will permit it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market ii the advisor will not initiate additional positions in any commodity if these positions would result in aggregate positions requiring a margin of more than   of the masters net assets allocated to the advisor iii the master may occasionally accept delivery of a commodity unless such delivery is disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse the physical commodity position is fully hedged iv the master does not employ the trading technique commonly known as pyramiding in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or related commodities v the master does not utilize borrowings other than shortterm borrowings if the master takes delivery of any cash commodities vi the advisor may from time to time employ trading strategies such as spreads or straddles on behalf of the master spreads and straddles describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets vii the master will not permit the churning of its commodity trading account the term churning refers to the practice of entering and exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to profit from the trades indicating the desire to generate commission income from january   through december   the partnerships average margin to equity ratio ie the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin was approximately  the foregoing margin to equity ratio takes into account cash held in the partnerships name as well as the allocable value of the positions and cash held on behalf of the partnership in the name of the master in the normal course of business the partnership through its investment in the master is party to financial instruments with offbalancesheet risk including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments these financial instruments may include futures forwards options and swaps whose values are based upon an underlying asset index or reference rate and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates or in the case of derivative commodity instruments to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash through physical delivery or with another financial instrument these instruments may be traded on an exchange a swap execution facility or overthecounter otc exchangetraded instruments include futures and certain standardized forward option and swap contracts certain swap contracts may also be traded on a swap execution facility or otc otc contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain forward and option contracts specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted the purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option the writer or seller of an option has unlimited risk each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those relating to the underlying financial instrument including market and credit risk in general the risks associated with otc contracts are greater than those associated with exchangetraded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an otc contract market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the master due to market changes including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded the master is exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract the partnerships and the masters risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments the partnerships and the masters risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the partnership and the master to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events the partnership and the master had credit risk and concentration risk as msco andor cgm or their affiliates were the sole counterparties or brokers with respect to the partnerships and the masters assets credit risk with respect to exchangetraded instruments was reduced to the extent that through msco andor cgm the partnerships and the masters counterparty was an exchange or clearing organization the partnership and the master continue to be subject to such risks with respect to msco the general partner monitors and attempts to control the partnerships and the masters risk exposure on a daily basis through financial credit and risk management monitoring systems and accordingly believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the partnership and the master may be subject these monitoring systems generally allow the general partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with riskadjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics in addition online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures forward and option contracts by sector margin requirements gain and loss transactions and collateral positions the risk to the limited partners that have purchased redeemable units is limited to the amount of their share of the partnerships net assets and undistributed profits this limited liability is a consequence of the organization of the partnership as a limited partnership under new york law   see also item  financial statements and supplementary data for further information on financial instrument risk included in the notes to financial statements other than the risks inherent in commodity futures forwards options and swaps trading the partnership knows of no trends demands commitments events or uncertainties which will result in or which are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way the limited partnership agreement provides that the general partner may cause the partnership to cease trading operations under certain circumstances including a decrease in net asset value per redeemable unit of any class to less than  as of the close of business on any business day in addition the general partner may in its sole discretion cause the partnership to dissolve if the aggregate net assets of the partnership decline to less than  b capital resources i the partnership has made no material commitments for capital expenditures ii the partnerships capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by expenses interest income redemptions of redeemable units and distributions of profits if any gains or losses on trading cannot be predicted market movements in commodities are dependent upon fundamental and technical factors which the advisor may or may not be able to identify such as changing supply and demand relationships weather government agricultural commercial and trade programs and policies national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates partnership expenses consist of among other things clearing ongoing selling agent management and general partner fees the level of these expenses is dependent upon trading performance and the level of net assets maintained in addition the amount of interest income payable by the partnerships commodity broker is dependent upon interest rates over which neither the partnership nor the commodity broker has control no forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period a limited partner may require the partnership to redeem its redeemable units at their net asset value as of the last day of any month on three business days notice to the general partner

and legal liability attributable to operational problems such as inaccurate pricing of transactions untimely trade execution clearance andor settlement or the inability to process large volumes of

systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access mishandling or misuse computer viruses or malware cyber attacks and other events that could have a security impact on such systems if one or more of

the masters net asset value per unit as a practical expedient as calculated by the master masters fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to fair values derived from unobservable inputs level  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the fair value of exchangetraded futures option and forward contracts is determined by the various exchanges and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately  pm et on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges the fair value of nonexchangetraded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options using as input the spot prices interest rates and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately  pm et on the last business day of the reporting period us treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period the master considers prices for exchangetraded commodity futures forward swap and option contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level  the values of us treasury bills nonexchangetraded forward swap and certain option contracts for which market quotations are not readily available are priced by broker quotes or pricing services that derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs level  as of and for the years ended december   and  the master did not hold any derivative instruments that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of the general partners assumptions and internal valuation pricing models level  transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period for the years ended december   and  there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between level  and level  futures contracts the master trades futures contracts a futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or
