adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share which reflect the provision for income taxes only to the extent such taxes are currently payable in cash in addition management excludes from adjusted net income charges and credits that are unusual and infrequently occurring management believes adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are useful performance measures because they more closely measure the cash flows generated by the company’s operations and the trends in those cash flows than do gaap net income and earnings per share and because they exclude the effects of transactions that are not indicative of the company’s ongoing results of operations adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are nongaap measures as of january   the company had net deferred income tax assets of approximately  million of which approximately  million related to federal and state net operating loss carryovers the company’s federal net operating loss carryovers totaled approximately  million the company has reported cumulative pretax income of over  million since the beginning of fiscal  and the company also has generated significant taxable income during this period however because of the company’s utilization of its federal and state net operating loss carryovers and other deferred tax assets the company’s cash payments for income taxes have been relatively insignificant during this period as a result the provision for income tax expense has substantially exceeded cash payments for income taxes until such time as the company’s net operating loss carryovers are exhausted or expire gaap income tax expense is expected to continue to substantially exceed the amount of cash income taxes payable by the company in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded  million in employee termination benefits and  million related to the previously announced merger costs of this magnitude and nature are excluded from adjusted net income because including them is not representative of the ongoing performance of the company’s remaining assets the following nongaap financial information and related reconciliation of adjusted net income to gaap net income are provided to assist the reader in understanding the effects of the above facts and transactions on the company’s results of operations in addition the nongaap financial information is intended to illustrate the material difference between the company’s income tax expense and income taxes currently payable as well as reflect the ongoing performance of the business these nongaap performance measures are consistent with other measurements made by management in the operation of the business that do not consider certain employee termination benefits merger costs and income taxes except to the extent to which those taxes currently are payable for example in capital allocation decisions and incentive compensation measurements that are made on a pretax basis         three months

but exclude sales among company and franchise stores the company believes systemwide sales data are useful in assessing consumer demand for the company’s products the overall success of the krispy kreme brand and ultimately the performance of the company all of the company’s royalty revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by the company’s domestic and international franchisees and substantially all of kk supply chain’s external sales of doughnut mixes and other ingredients ultimately are determined by demand for the company’s products at franchise stores accordingly sales by the company’s franchisees have a direct effect on the company’s royalty and kk supply chain revenues and therefore on the company’s profitability the company’s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein include sales by company stores sales to franchisees by the kk supply chain segment and royalties and fees received from franchise stores based on their sales but exclude sales by franchise stores to their customers  computed on a pro forma basis assuming the average rate of exchange between the us dollar and each of the foreign currencies in which the company’s international franchisees conduct business had been the same in the comparable prior year period  company stores contribution represents company stores revenues less costs of food beverage and packaging labor and benefit costs vehicle costs occupancy and other store related costs and excludes depreciation and amortization expense marketing expenses and segment general and administration expenses company stores contribution is a nongaap financial measure and the company believes this is a useful measure to assess and evaluate the performance of its company stores segment  the change in “same store sales” represents the aggregate retail sales excluding fundraising sales during the current year period for all stores which had been open for  or more months during the current year period divided by the aggregate retail sales of such stores for the comparable weeks in the preceding year period once a store has been open for at least  consecutive months its sales are included in the computation of same stores sales for all subsequent periods in the event a store is closed temporarily for example for remodeling and has no sales during one or more weeks such store’s sales for the comparable weeks during the earlier or subsequent period are excluded from the same store sales computation  company stores consumer packaged goods  wholesale sales “average weekly number of

measure panera has been one of the most successful restaurant companies in history” shaich saidshaich said in panera’  years as a publicly traded company it has been the best performing restaurant stock of the past twenty years – up over  percent“todays transaction is a direct reflection of those efforts and delivers substantial additional value for our shareholders” shaich said“the themes we have bet on – digital wellness loyalty omnichannel new formats for growth – are shaping the restaurant industry today”olivier goudet a jab partner and chief executive said the strong panera financial performance and management team led jab to make its offer“we strongly support paneras vision for the future strategic initiatives culture of innovation and balanced company vs franchise store mix” goudet said“we are excited to invest in and work together with the companys management team and franchisees to continue to lead the industry jab said it will follow the same format with panera as it did with krispy kreme converting them into a private company retaining local management headquarters and workforcehowever much of krispy kreme’s management team prior to the sale including chief executive tony thompson have left the company most apparently left with lucrative goldenparachute compensation packagesjab holding also has a controlling interest in keurig green mountain peet’s coffee  tea caribou coffee co jacobs douwe egberts espresso house in scandinavia and einstein noah restaurant group incnick setyan an analyst with wedbush securities inc said that when krispy kreme was taken private that “it has been increasingly clear from recent management articulations of their strategy that they are investing in a longterm transformation of the business”“usually it is easier to focus on the long term as a private company”john stanton a professor of food marketing at saint josephs university in philadelphia said im not sure what direction this will gothe main issue is whether jab will allow panera to stay on the strategy that has made it successful businesses frequently buy great brands and then merge them into the companys model losing the essence of the brandthe other coffee businesses and krispy kreme might benefit from the panera supply chain knowledge stanton said but panera and krispy may not be on the same strategic plane this might be a case of just
