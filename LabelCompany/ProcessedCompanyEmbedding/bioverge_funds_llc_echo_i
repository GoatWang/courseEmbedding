defines an accredited investor as anyone who earned income that exceeded  or  together with a spouse in each of the prior two years and reasonably expects the same for the current year or has a net worth over  million either alone or together with a spouse excluding the value of the person’s primary residence please refer to the sec website for additional information here while bioverge is initially only available to accredited investors we anticipate offering investment opportunities to all investors including nonaccredited investors under regulation crowdfunding very soon we encourage all investors to sign up and complete a profile indicating your areas of interest in order to keep updated on the latest news from bioverge what is a bioverge fund a bioverge fund is a special purpose entity that is formed for the specific purpose of investing in a startup the purpose of a bioverge fund is to allow accredited investors to invest smaller amounts of capital into an individual startup thus enabling investors to build a more diversified portfolio we accomplish this by aggregating accredited investors into a bioverge fund which then makes the investment into the startup investors do not invest directly in the startup but rather invest through a bioverge fund all bioverge funds are managed by bioverge funds management llc an except reporting advisor how do i sell my investment investments in a bioverge fund are illiquid and cannot be easily sold investors earn a return when the startup achieves a liquidity event such as the sale of the company or an ipo when this occurs investors receive their prorata share of the returns generated from the bioverge fund investing in startup is risky and most startups fail meaning you should be prepared to lose all of your investment how do i earn a return the only way to realize a return is when the startup has a liquidity event such as an ipo or is acquired the bioverge fund will then distribute each investor’s pro rata share of the profits less the  carry charge by the fund what fees do you charge we utilize the carried interest business model and charge investors a  carry on successful exits we also charge an administrative fee for the cost of establishing the investment fund once the minimum threshold for establishing the fund has been reached importantly this administrative fee can only be legally used to cover our direct fund costs not taken as profit any leftover funds are returned to investors how do you select which startups to list startups must apply to be listed please refer to the learn more page for a detailed overview of our selection process what is dynamic diligence our dynamic diligence utilizes a decisionanalysis model — derived from the os fund — to help determine the riskadjusted return for novel science and technologybased investments we combine this model with input from our network of scientific and technical experts and professional investors to create a dynamic feedback loop which we term dynamic diligence all investment opportunities undergo this process prior to going live on our site what is the role of the investment committee the investment committee is tasked with answering the following questions does the third party investment sufficiently serve to validate the technology do the dynamic diligence findings provide sufficient support to justify an investment ie is the risk  reward profile attractive are the financial terms proposed by the lead investor reasonable and potentially attractive to our members ie type of offering premoney valuation valuation cap discount etc what are the key risks associated with the offering   bio key international inc bkyi bizpediaxyz  we monitor changes in companies bizpediaxyz  we monitor changes in companies bio key

next driver of microsoft corporation msft stock ai view all posts you can count on amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn to come up with … interesting … ideas like dronedelivered packages dash buttons for pushbutton ordering of products and the idea it came up with in  to stuff its alexa digital assistant in a wireless speaker — the amazon echo source amazon that echo smart speaker has taken off in a way that no one predicted and spawned competitors like alphabet inc’s nasdaqgoogl google home now amazon is cranking up the creative with the echo look a device the company describes as “a hands free camera and style assistant” and once again alexa is inside what is echo look amazon has built a wireless camera with a builtin microphone array a speaker and alexa integration like the amazon echo you can ask alexa to play music order toilet paper or control you smart home devices using skills oh it’s also a camera amazon is positioning it as something that works with your smartphone as a kind of virtual mirror the command “alexa take a picture” snaps a full length photo with background blurred amazon says this makes your “outfit pop” and blurring the background makes your photos more shareable presumably by hiding all your dirty laundry and unmade bed you can get a live look at yourself from different angles using the echo look app you can ask alexa to shoot a video so you can see yourself from every angle and you can submit photos of yourself to amazon for ai advice based on input from “fashion specialists” you can also create a personal “lookbook” in the app which appears to be a catalog remember those of you modelling all your outfits why would anyone want this people who want to be dressed according to the whims of artificial intelligence people who haven’t figured out mirrors if you live alone or don’t trust the fashion sense of the people you do live with echo look promises a second opinion on your outfit choices albeit an option from an ai owned by a company that wants to sell you new clothes with the ongoing addition of skills that integrate it with other services and devices it’s possible that the the echo look could also expand into functionality like a fitness camera capturing progress photos or a security camera so what could go wrong it goes without saying that people will use echo look in ways amazon had not intended that’s human nature put a camera in bedroom that snaps photos or shoots video on voice command with led lighting and lenses that blur the background and it seems inevitable that content shot with amazon echo is going to start showing up online of course the elephant in the room is the ongoing privacy concerns about smart speakers people have been freaked out about alexa always listening what if alexa is also always watching amazon told arstechnica uk there is a button to physically disable the camera and microphone it’s a single button however so if you turn off the camera you also shut down alexa voice command so people are going to be tempting to simply leave it on so they can continue to ask alexa the weather forecast next page     view all view all   article printed from investorplace media

model — is the problem with googl stock today source travis wise via flickr all the signs are there people are driving faster rushing for the last dollar money is being thrown at the market heedless of risk more important it is being thrown at what has worked during this recovery and those values are rising parabolically i’ve seen this movie before i saw it with oil in  with leveraged buyout companies in the late s with internet stocks in the s and with real estate during the last decade parabolic moves upward are followed by panicky moves down like a tornado that lifts a house to the sky then drops it at more than  per share investors are paying over  times earnings for googl stock even if alphabet could maintain its  growth rate indefinitely it would take  years to earn that investment back google’s power and growth rate are simply unsustainable the  billion fine being threatened by the european union would represent  of its  revenues it is regularly accused of evil intent even when it does things — like blocking annoying ads — that are unquestionably good welcome to silly season even analysts who regularly pound the table for the stock like our bret kenwell are starting to have second thoughts kenwell believes alphabet’s waymo selfdriving car unit alone could be worth  billion i find that hard to fathom in a world where general motors company nysegm is fighting to hold  billion and one in which waymo has said it doesn’t know how to massproduce motor cars even taking that out he still comes up with a price that’s “foamy” while alphabet has a lot of fingers in interesting pies it has yet to prove it can capitalize on any of them google home is trailing amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn echo badly when it comes to home automation despite a long head start the same is true with many other products and services like google shopping its virtual reality efforts and cloud services something seems to happen at googl between the time a new product is cool and when it’s accepted by the mass market either alphabet gets market share and no profits or no market share outside the key areas of search and digital advertising it doesn’t execute well against competitors what could happen to googl stock most of the trouble with alphabet stock here is as kenwell says technical it is far above its moving averages whether measured by the quarter or the year

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information

corporation and an s corporation c corporations are subject to double taxation that is one tax at the corporate level on the corporations net income and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed s corporations have only one level of taxation all of their income is allocated to the shareholders however c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield

an s corporation get started by answering a few questions about your company and we will file your paperwork with the secretary of state how do i choose a corporate name in general the name of a corporation must end with incorporated corporation or an abbreviation of one of these a name will not be accepted if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name of another corporation already formed in that state many states also restrict the use of certain terms in a corporations name like bank police or insurance legalzoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names in order of preference we will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are available please note that for government purposes the names abc inc and abc corp are identical therefore you should disregard spaces periods and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name choices if the name of your corporation will be used in connection with goods or

business office in the state of formation that provides registered agent services one of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is that any officer or director of a corporation or manager or member of an llc can act as the registered agent however there are some advantages to having another person or company act as your registered agent first this
