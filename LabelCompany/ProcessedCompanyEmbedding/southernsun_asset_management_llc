philosophy words of wisdom “most of all we need intimate knowledge of the past not that the past has any magic about it but because we cannot study the future and yet need something to set against the present to remind us that the basic assumptions have been quite different in different periods and that much which seems certain to the uneducated is merely temporary fashion a man who has lived in many places is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village the scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune from the cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age” cs lewis learning in wartime oxford university  contact southernsun telephone  fax  address  poplar avenue suite  memphis tn  team « southernsun asset

philosophy we painstakingly evaluate companies in three critical areas financial flexibility management adaptability and niche dominance financial flexibility southernsun invests in companies we believe to be financially strong and flexible it is important to us that these companies not be reliant on capital markets to execute their business plan we seek financial strength as evidenced by internally generated discretionary cash flow excess working capital organic revenue growth management adaptability at southernsun we believe there is no substitute for knowing the management of the companies in which we invest our clients’ assets it is critical that management be experienced we visit with management teams and evaluate their facilities on a regular basis were they able to maintain their focus on longterm goals while moving through current conditions in brief we look for management that is experienced forward thinking focused on measurable goals execution oriented niche dominance an equally important aspect of our investment process is that the businesses in which southernsun invests are niche dominant our portfolio companies distinguish themselves by the products or services they offer and are at a point in their life cycle when they are not readily recognized or rewarded in the marketplace the primary competition for these entities is often a division or subsidiary of a large public company or a private company portfolio monitoring once companies make it into our portfolios at southernsun our analysts conduct continuous evaluations of their financials as well as monitor the business environment in which they operate this work is performed from southernsun’s headquarters as well as in the field we visit management and their facilities on a regular basis we do not believe we can truly know what is happening at a company unless we maintain regular contact with them we also take advantage of eventdriven market anomalies and adjust our positions as

philosophy we painstakingly evaluate companies in three critical areas financial flexibility management adaptability and niche dominance more on our investment philosophy words of wisdom “most of all we need intimate knowledge of the past not that the past has any magic about it but because we cannot study the future and yet need something to set against the present to remind us that the basic assumptions have been quite different in different periods and that much which seems certain to the uneducated is merely temporary fashion a man who has lived in many places is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village the scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune from the cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age” cs lewis learning in wartime oxford university  contact southernsun telephone  fax  address  poplar avenue suite  memphis tn  yelp yelp sorry you’re not allowed to access this page
