semipro league to debut in july has changed over the past year instead of dawning as an over league for former nba players age is no longer a requirement the only résumé requirement is being on an nba

quality — getting guys who are in shape and still passionate to play basketball guys who are going to take it seriously” harrington told the post “at the end of the day we’ll put on a real good product out there at a time in the dead of summer when nothing’s going on as a supplement it should be right at the level of the dleague” but with a lot more name recognition gotham will play its twomonth season at the newly remodeled nassau coliseum as well as barclays center the nets may step into a managerial role for gotham the  teams are owned by the league for now but gotham is in the process of having fans be able to buy shares of stock in the franchise part of the player’s salary also will be stock options in an attempt to market to kids fans will be allowed to take photos with the players before and after games ticket prices will be around  “that will have a huge impact having former allstars with name recognition definitely helps this league” harrington said “we’ve rounded

league organizers believes it will fill a void “we saw an opportunity to play in established nba markets during the summer months because there is no nationwide competitive men’s basketball league for hoops fans during that time” said carl george ceo of the cbl “we’ve found that fans of basketball love to watch the sport all year round not just during the season” and who knows after the disasters
