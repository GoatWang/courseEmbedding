acuamark diagnostics technology and practices q does early detection of cancer from a blood sample help increase survival and cure rates accurate early detection of cancer can increase cure and survival rates because growth is detected before the cancer cells have expanded into more aggressive clones and before the tumor mass has grown spread out of control and metastasized throughout the bodythe ability to detect molecular markers in the blood provides hope that cancers could be eradicated earlier for instance for colorectal cancer early cancersurvival rates are higher than  stage i but when discovered too late stage iv survival rates plummet to less than depending on how completely our highly accurate screening test is adapted by the public it would allow for about a  to  reduction of colorectal cancer deaths and would save over  billion in healthcare costs per year in the us aloneq why is acuamark diagnostics starting with a test for early colon cancer the founding scientists have a deep understanding of the colon cancer field and have developed some of the initial molecular databases as well as discovered and developed diagnostic tests for some of the key colon cancer genes for an early detection test in colorectal cancer a positive test result leads to a clear actionable event ie the patient goes for a colonoscopyseveral studies have shown that colonoscopies do detect early cancers and save lives the advantage of theacuamark diagnostics blood screen is that it identifies the very individuals who would most benefit from a colonoscopy at the earliest stage in parallel to our colorectal cancer screening test we are developing a pancancer screening test which will reliably detect the majority of major cancers at the earliest stages q besides early detection of colorectal cancer will acuamark diagnostics develop tests for other cancers such as ovarian pancreatic gastric prostrate and lung cancer yes the fundamental technology will work for identifying any cancers at their early stages the acuamark diagnostics team believes that the efficiencies created by its proprietary methods are so powerful that they ultimately may enable our team to develop the eagle i and eagle iseq technology into a panoncology bloodbased test for early detection of colorectal stomach pancreatic liver esophageal breast ovarian cervical uterine bladder kidney prostate testicular lung head and neck cancers glioblastoma and other brain cancers thyroid and neuroendocrine cancers melanomas skin sarcomas leukemias and lymphomasq will acuamark diagnostics blood test for the early detection of cancer replace existing hospitalbased diagnostic procedures such as eg colonoscopies for colorectal cancer and imaging exams acuamark diagnostics technology is designed to detect cancer in its early stages from blood our blood test is an early warning signal or the equivalent of the “canary in the coal mine” the goal is to accurately identify cancer early on through a noninvasive and inexpensive screening method that is easily accessible to all during the annual checkup at your general practitioner’s practice at retail clinics etc and thereby avoid cancers being detected only at advanced or terminal stages or when symptoms are already manifestingaccurate screening tests for earlystage cancer will limit the chances that an individual undergoes advanced and expensive diagnostic procedures such as imaging unnecessarily but if the test reports “presumptive positive” then further standard diagnostic workup eg advanced diagnostics such as imaging etc would still be necessary to verify and confirm the presence and location of the cancer q i come from a family with a history of cancer is the acuamark diagnostics test right for me yes the acuamark diagnostics test is designed to find early cancer both in individuals with a family history ie inherited cancer as well as in those with no clear risk factors for instance acuamark diagnostics initial test  the colorectal cancer screening test  will be recommended on an annual basis for those atincreased risk for inherited cancer in addition any individual with a family history of specific cancers breast colon esophagus liver etc should consider being tested for inherited mutations q will the eagle i test enable detection of advanced adenomas there are many issues associated with finding small growths known as polyps and uncertainty around which might remain harmless and which may progress physicians and scientists in europe and the us offer a wide range of opinions on what is in the best interest of the patientin short acuamark diagnostics believes that what matters is a costeffective convenient test that has a high enough sensitivity and specificity and is done frequently enough to catch cancers at the earliest time and when they are most treatableq how do you differentiate from some of the other blood tests in development the eagle i fivedimensional approach lets us see further and deeper in the blood with higher accuracy higher scalability and at a lower cost our proprietary approach will allow us to identify tissue of origin anddistinguish benign lesions from early stages of an aggressive cancer in which high surveillance or even prompt treatment is desired and leads to better outcomesq how will acuamark diagnostics demonstrate the clinical utility of the acuamark diagnostics blood test we intend to conduct several clinical trials to support regulatory approval of our technology our clinical study design will be sufficiently robust to assess the clinical utility of our cancer screening blood testsfrom early on we will work closely with the relevant regulatory authorities in order to design and conduct our validation studyq how will acuamark diagnostics approach overcome false positivesmost current tests are based on one or a few markers but normal variation in the human population leads to high rates of falsepositive results – as high as  to  our eagle i assays look at many markers in multiplemolecular dimensions to provide a highly accurate and quantitative measure our ability to detect cancer at the single molecule level with internal proofreading enables an unprecedented level of accuracyq how will acuamark diagnostics approach overcome false negativesour eagle i assays are already able to detect cancer markers at the singlemolecule level as a tumor grows it sends out more cancer molecules and signals into the bloodstream our approach is estimated to identify most of the earliest stage i tumors by performing the testevery year even if an early stage i tumor is missed chances are extremely high it will be detected the following year as a late stage i or early and still curable stage ii cancerq how will i be able to access an acuamark diagnostics screening testwe anticipate that the acuamark diagnostics screening tests will require the drawing of  tubes of blood once acuamark diagnostics tests are available your primary care practitioner or retail clinic of preference will draw cancer screening blood together with samples for the other tests associated with yourannual checkup and ship them to a lab once the results are known your primary care physician will discuss them with you along with the other results of your annual checkup  address lexington ave th floornew
