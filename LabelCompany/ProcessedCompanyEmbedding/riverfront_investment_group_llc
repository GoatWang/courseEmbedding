supplementing this market of which itll is now becoming a key player the otcqb is an elite tier of the over the counter markets these are companies that have audited financials available are current in their reporting have verified management and shareholders and additional disclosure requirements to meet all in all this signifies that itll is on the ball and doing business the right way morningstar rates otcitll at an excellent  stars meaning it is of fair value the rating is determined by three factors a stocks current price morningstars estimate of the stocks fair value and the uncertainty rating of the fair value the bigger the discount the higher the star rating once again an excellent omen for savvy investorsbreaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements with such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat this is where otc itll comes into play their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space since itll is a public company we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry we’ve done some digging and have laid out  reasons why we believe itll may be the most profitable stock play of  breaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time theyre so common in fact we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations month after month for example in  alone weve already seen several major acquisitions telecom service provider gtt communications announced in june that it plans to buy network connectivity provider global capacity for  million in cash and  million shares of gtt common stock we also saw that in april windstream announced its plan to acquire cloudbased unified communications provider broadview networks in an allcash transaction worth  million and if that isnt enough in march zayo group holdings inc closed its  billion acquisition of electric lightwave the company formerly known as integra telecom all of this happened in just the last few monthsall this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether itll has what it takes to dance with the big guys well it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model big companies like verizon are making money hand over fist  why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usualitll has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive a similar situation took place in canada some years ago when a company named wind mobile came into play over a few short years wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition recently shaw bought them out for  billion as a result of all this our opinion of the itll business model is excellent  weve seen this business model work before  if you’ve missed putting this on your stock tracker take a moment and do it right now for more information about

periods that are agreed upon between us and the profiled issuer and  or third party paying us our publication of the information is known as a “campaign” this information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes hours days or even weeks apart typically the trading volume and price of a profiled issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors therefore the later an investor receives the information the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a profiled issuer late in

hold while we tell investors to purchase during the campaign intelligent cloud resources inc is a penny stock that was illiquid little to no trading volume prior to our campaign and therefore these securities are subject to wide fluctuations in trading price and volume during the campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each profile issuer will likely increase significantly

ie in its quarterly and annual reports or if it is an otc markets pink sheet quoted company it may be delinquent in its pink sheet reporting obligations which may result in otc markets posting a negative legend pertaining to the profiled issuer at wwwotcmarketscom as follows i “limited information” for companies with financial reporting problems economic distress or that are unwilling to file

increases and investors share in the appreciation however if it goes bankrupt or performs poorly investors can lose their entire initial investment ie the stock price can go to zero  bonds represent a loan made by an investor to a corporation or government  as such the investor gets a guaranteed interest rate for a specific period of time and expects to get their original investment back at the end

communication sec charges  penalty on riverfront investment group with failing to clearly disclose additional costs to investors jul   an sec investigation found that riverfront investment group disclosed to investors in forms adv that client trades were typically executed through the sponsoring broker so the wrap fee would cover the transaction costs but riverfront actually used brokers besides the wrap program sponsor to execute the majority of its wrap program trading resulting in additional costs to clients for those transactions while riverfront did disclose that some trading away from the sponsoring broker could occur the firm inaccurately described the frequency rendering its disclosures materially misleading riverfront agreed to settle the secs charges the secs national exam program has included wrap fee programs among its annual examination priorities particularly assessing whether advisers are fulfilling fiduciary and contractual obligations to clients and properly managing such aspects as disclosures conflicts of interest best execution and trading away from the sponsor the secs order against riverfront finds that the firm violated sections  and  of the investment advisers act of  and rule a without admitting or denying the findings riverfront agreed to be censured and pay a  penalty and the firm must post on its website on a quarterly basis the

our “trade away” practices july   the following disclosure is published in an effort to provide riverfront wrap fee account clients with more information regarding our trading practices specifically the use of trade away transactions as described below and certain costs relevant to these practices  it is not a comprehensive description of all riverfront trading policies and procedures  additional information and disclosures are available in our form adv part a riverfront offers asset allocation portfolios for a range of investment objectives and risk tolerances that can be bought through wrap fee programs at dually registered brokerage and investment advisory firms referred to throughout this document as “sponsor firms” riverfront has trading discretion over these asset allocation portfolios if they are purchased as separately managed accounts “smas” riverfront does not have trading discretion over portfolios purchased in unified managed accounts “umas” and model delivery programs “mdps”  the information below pertains only to sma wrap fee clients that have granted riverfront trading discretion over their accounts presently “maintenance trades” which we define as trading that results from new accounts liquidations cashsecurity addition or withdrawals tax harvesting or any other clientrequested transactions are typically processed through the client’s sponsor firm’s managedmoney desk   portfolio managementdriven model changes acrosstheboard or “atb” trades are typically aggregated and submitted via a block trade to a thirdparty brokerage firm in order to seek best execution a “trade away transaction” riverfront does not currently execute trade away transactions with its sponsor firms  we have determined that best execution on our atb trades is generally achieved through trade away transactions even though our sma clients will incur additional brokerage costs related to the trade away transactions see the table below for additional information on these costs  while the sponsor firms’ managed money desks have proven very capable we often have complicated execution strategies that require greater timing flexibility or in the case of exchangetraded products “etps” which includes both exchangetraded funds and exchangetraded notes that demand direct access to an authorized participant for a single block execution trading away has many advantages including without limitation that it leads to less price dispersion limits exposure to information leakage and high frequency traders and allows us to be more nimble in our trading thereby avoiding potential delay costs we have considered executing these atb transactions via a trade rotation among the sponsor firms however based on our trading experience and analysis we currently believe that trading away enables us to achieve best execution for our clients  riverfront’s best execution committee will continue to periodically evaluate our trade execution strategy in order to ensure that we continue to provide best execution for our clients by trading away our atb trades we believe that we can obtain better execution for our clients and eliminate price dispersion across different sponsor firms  furthermore we have been able to identify other avenues of liquidity away from our sponsor firm managed money desks  we can use a variety of algorithms to optimize each unique trading objective  logical participation strategies such as volumeweighted average price “vwap” and timeweighted average price “twap” can be managed in a single block which helps to achieve better execution than can be accomplished through a series of small transactions with sponsor firms  finally for etp securities that may appear to be illiquid we can use brokers that are able to source liquidity in an alternative manner to minimize price impact and ensure execution near the etp’s net asset value “nav”  we regard the ability to create and redeem the etp basket as a critical requirement to achieve our bestexecution requirements and thus request that etp buys and sells are consolidated into a single block execution  riverfront is a tactical manager therefore we trade   frequently in our portfolios  in volatile markets such as those we have experienced over the past several years we tend to trade even more frequently  and in fastmoving markets we believe that trade rotations can be  detrimental to a client’s portfolio performance if the trades cannot be executed in a timely manner for the reasons stated above riverfront has determined that best execution should be achieved differently for atb trades than for maintenance trades  riverfront believes that atb trades are in most cases better executed through trade away transactions while maintenance trades are usually better executed through the clients’ sponsor firms  the chart below provides the volume of wrap fee trades by market value executed via trade away transactions as well as the known associated transaction costs charged by nondesignated brokerdealers that are netted into the price of the security and passed onto wrap fee clients as a result of these trades  this information is provided for each riverfront investment strategy available to wrap fee clients we have disclosed these trading practices in our form adv part a which is provided to clients upon opening a riverfront account and at a minimum offered annually thereafter  our form adv part a and part a is also publically available at httpwwwadviserinfosecgov please contact riverfront at  andor inforiverfrontigcom if you would like a copy of our most recent form adv part a sent to you or if you have any questions regarding our trading practices    wrap fee program trade away transaction information    all percentages are approximate  for purposes of this calculation we divided a the total dollar amount of wrap fee client transactions including all stock bond and etp transactions in securities that were placed with brokerdealers other than the clients’ sponsor firms trade away transactions by b the total dollar amount of wrap fee client transactions including all stock bond and etp transactions that riverfront placed with all brokerdealers in each case during the relevant period  for example assume riverfront placed a total of  transactions for wrap fee clients during q having an aggregate dollar amount of   of that total riverfront placed  of those transactions with brokerdealers that were not the clients’ sponsor firms trade away transactions and the aggregate dollar value of those  transactions was   thus in this example the percentage dollar amount of trades in securities traded away in q would be reflected as    this number is the percentage of all trade away transactions that were executed as risk trades working orders or bond trades where there was no disclosed markupmarkdown  in these instances the undisclosed markup or markdown is netted into the price the client receives  since the executing broker does not provide data regarding the dollar amount of the markup or markdown we have listed the costs for these trades as “unknown” these types of trades include but are not limited to transactions in shares of etps in which an authorized participant or market maker is providing riverfront with a twosided market for execution in an effort to provide precise disclosure we separate those trades which have a disclosed markupmarkdown certain agency trades from those trades which have a markupmarkdown that is not disclosed to riverfront risk trades working orders and bond transactions   the average commission calculation includes all transactions in stocks and etps that were executed on an agency basis with an explicit commission expressed in terms of an average cents per share cps this calculation is disclosed to us through our trading partners via trade confirmations important disclosures as noted above the information provided is approximate and the cents per share cps information reflects the average cents per share  please note that this data was compiled to the best of our ability given system constraints and limitations  riverfront investment group llc

follow an index in selecting the fund’s portfolio securities the subadviser assembles a portfolio of eligible securities based on several core attributes such as value quality and momentum the subadviser riverfront investment group llc “riverfront” will consider multiple proprietary factors within each core attribute such as the pricetobook value of a security when determining value a company’s cash as a percentage of the company’s market capitalization when determining quality and a security’s three month relative price change when determining momentum riverfront then assigns each qualifying security a score based on its core attributes and selects the individual securities with the highest scores for investment in doing so riverfront utilizes its proprietary optimization process to maximize the percentage of highscoring securities included in the portfolio a “highscoring” security within our investment process does not guarantee a favorable performance or ensure against loss riverfront will also consider the market capitalization of the companies in which the fund may invest and the trading volume of a company’s shares in the secondary market investable securities under normal market conditions the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least  of its net assets in a portfolio of exchangetraded equity securities of publicly traded us companies the exchangetraded equity securities the fund may invest in as part of its principal investments are common stocks and common or preferred shares of real estate investment trusts
