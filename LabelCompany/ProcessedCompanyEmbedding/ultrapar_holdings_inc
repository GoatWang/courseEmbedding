this amount investments in ultragaz should amount to approximately r million a  reduction as compared to  as part of its strategy of focusing on productivity and efficiency at oxiteno investments are

diesel fuel oil and electricity natural gas is currently the principal source of energy against which we compete natural gas is currently less expensive than lpg for industrial consumers who purchase large volumes but more expensive for residential consumers in addition supply of natural gas requires significant investments in pipelines the development of alternatives sources of energy in the future may adversely affect the lpg market and consequently our business financial results and results of operations  ultragaz’s main competitors are † shv gas formed by the merger of minasgs sa and supergasbrs sa and controlled by shv energy a major multinational lpg distributor which operates through its two separate brands “minasgs” and “supergasbrs” † liquigs formerly controlled by eni group and acquired by petrobras in june  which has been operating in the brazilian lpg distribution sector for more than  years and † butano a domestic brazilian lpg distributor which has been present in the market for more than  years the following table sets forth the market share of ultragaz and its competitors market share for the year  lpg distributor    ultragaz       shv gas       liquigs       butano       others       total        includes sales volume of shell gs since its acquisition in august   proportional to shv equity stakes in the operating companies as of july  shv gas owned  of its operating subsidiaries in brazil prior to  the government specified the areas in which lpg distributors were permitted to operate and each lpg distributor was allocated a limit in its lpg sales for each brazilian geographic region in which it operated these limits impacted the growth of larger lpg distributors and limited competition among lpg distributors these restrictions were removed as part of the deregulation process resulting in a substantial increase in competition among domestic lpg distributors  oxiteno competes largely with imported products since  it has had to operate in an increasingly competitive environment due to imports from international and transnational petrochemical industries as imported products are mostly commodity chemicals competition is based principally on price importers incur additional costs when selling their products in the brazilian market due to import tariffs which generally range between  and  and additional freight charges however factors such as product quality timely delivery reliability of supply and technical service and support are also important competitive factors because it is a local producer oxiteno believes it has a particular competitive advantage over imports with regard to timely delivery and reliability of supply in the case of specialty chemicals oxiteno competes primarily with other brazilian producers which buy ethylene oxide from oxiteno and pricing is a less decisive competitive factor than with true commodity chemicals while conformity with specifications product performance and reliability of service are comparatively more important access to technology and research and development are important factors with regard to conformity to specifications and product performance especially in the development of new products to meet customers’ needs as oxiteno’s competitors have research and development resources oxiteno’s strategy involves ensuring access to technology through its own research and development activity licensing and joint ventures if appropriate opportunities become available oxiteno’s principal competitors are shell brasil ltda exxon mobil qumica ltda dow brasil sa lyondell
