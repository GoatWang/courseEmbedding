commission commission for its complaint alleges as follows summary  this action concerns the activities of the defendant donald j macphee macphee the former chief financial officer of igi inc igi igi is a diversified company located in buena new jersey that produces and markets animal health and consumer products including mareks a poultry vaccine that is used to inoculate chickens against cancer at various times between  and june  macphee at the direction of igis former president engaged in improper accounting practices related to revenue recognition the recording of sales credits and igis inventory as a result of his misconduct macphee knew or was reckless in not knowing that he caused igi to materially overstate its assets revenues and net income and caused igi to file materially false and misleading reports and financial statements with the commission for igis fiscal years ended december   and december   and for the quarters ended march  and june    by engaging in such conduct macphee violated sections b and b of the securities exchange act of  exchange act  usc §§ jb and mb and exchange act rules b and b  cfr §§ b and b and was a cause of igis violations of sections a and ba and b of the exchange act  usc §§ ma and mba and b and exchange act rules b a and a  cfr §§ b a and a jurisdiction and venue  the commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by section d of the exchange act  usc § ud to obtain a civil money penalty from defendant macphee  this court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections  and  of the exchange act  usc §§ u and aa venue lies in this court pursuant to section  of the exchange act  usc § aa  the defendant directly and indirectly has made use of the mails or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the acts practices and transactions alleged herein certain of which occurred within the district of new jersey the defendant  donald j macphee age  resides in holland pennsylvania from  through june  macphee was the chief financial officer of igi in late june  macphee alerted igis outside counsel about financial irregularities at igi and in july  he departed igi for health reasons macphee is not now and was not at the time of his misconduct a certified public accountant first claim macphee violated sections b and b of the exchange act and exchange act rules b and b  paragraphs  through  above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference a overstatement of inventory and understatement of related expenses  from  through the second quarter of  igi while macphee was chief financial officer overstated its assets and net income by not recording properly the costs associated with reductions in its inventory for large quantities of mareks that were either destroyed or defective and could not be sold  in connection with this practice macphee at the direction of the former president of igi did not record the costs of large quantities of mareks inventory that were either destroyed or were defective instead macphee upon instruction from the former president established inventory reserves the former president decided when and how much mareks would be destroyed and directed macphee who complied with the directive to reduce or increase the inventory reserve balances to achieve the former presidents desired financial results macphee knew or was reckless in not knowing that the reserves did not properly reflect the costs of destroyed or defective inventory  as a result of macphees misconduct and that of others involving igis inventory igi while macphee was the companys chief financial officer overstated its assets and net income for fiscal years  and  and for the first two quarters of fiscal year  b improper recognition of revenue  sales cutoff  igis revenue recognition policy required that sales revenue be recognized when products were shipped contrary to this policy during fiscal years  and  and the first three quarters of fiscal year  igi routinely recorded sales of its products prior to shipment in order to fraudulently increase its quarterly and annual revenues and to manipulate its earnings  at or around the end of each quarter during the period from  through the second quarter of  the former president instructed macphee among others to hold igis books open and to record outofperiod sales macphee knew or was reckless in not knowing that as part of this practice employees backdated sales invoices igis accounting department which macphee supervised routinely informed the sales staff when the extended quarter had ended and when outofperiod sales should no longer be entered into igis computerized accounting system  as a result of macphees misconduct and that of others involving igis sales cutoff practices igi while macphee was the companys chief financial officer misstated its assets revenue and net income for fiscal years  and  during each interim quarter thereof and for the first two quarters of fiscal year  c failure to process and record sales credits on a timely basis  igi while macphee was chief financial officer failed to process and record sales credits on a timely basis in fiscal years  and  and during the first two quarters of fiscal year  by delaying the processing and recording of such credits igi misstated accounts receivable sales and net income from  through  and during the first two quarters of fiscal year   igi issued sales credits to its customers for returned products for the return of liquid nitrogen containers used to ship mareks and for promotional allowances customers generally sent requests for such credits to the sales clerks who prepared credit memoranda before entering the credits into igis accounting system the sales clerks sent the credit memoranda to their managers for approval  in fiscal year  the former president routinely instructed two former managers to delay approval of large sales credits until the revenue levels were high enough to allow writeoffs of the credits without affecting expected or targeted earnings macphee knew or was reckless in not knowing that the approval of large sales credits was being delayed in fiscal year   during  the former president instructed macphee not to record valid sales credits macphees knowing or reckless failure to record sales credits caused igi to overstate materially its assets revenues and net income in fiscal year   as a result of macphees misconduct and that of others involving sales credits igi while macphee was the companys chief financial officer misstated its assets revenues and net income for fiscal years  and  during each interim quarter thereof and for the first two quarters of fiscal year   section b of the exchange act

paragraphs  through  above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference  igi while macphee was igis chief financial officer filed with the commission annual reports on form k for its fiscal years ended december   and  and quarterly reports on forms q for the quarters ended march  and june   the financial statements in all the aforementioned filings were materially false and misleading by virtue of igis fraudulently inflated assets revenue and net income macphee signed igis forms k for fiscal year  and  the interim forms q for those years and the form q for the quarter ended march   macphee left igi in late june  and did not prepare or sign igis form q for the quarter ended june    during  through  igi had securities registered with the commission pursuant to section g of the exchange act  usc § lg as a result igi was required to file quarterly annual and other reports and statements with the commission which did not contain untrue statements of material facts or omissions of material facts and was required to make and keep books records and accounts which in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and dispositions of its assets igi also was required to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap or any other criteria applicable to such statements  as a result of macphees misconduct igi maintained with respect to fiscal years  and  and for the first two quarters of fiscal year  false and misleading books and records which among other things materially overstated its assets revenues and net income during those financial reporting periods  by reason of

has many uses but it is best known as the binding constituent of concrete the most extensively used manmade construction material in the modern world although considered largely an engineering material its setting and subsequent durability properties are controlled by chemistry consequently cement chemistry research over many years has lead to a range of technologically significant products and processes cement formulations appropriate for extreme environmental conditions are used routinely in mine stabilisation oil well cementing underwater construction cold weather climates etc · durable concretes can be designed to limit degradation that previously would have arisen due to reinforcement corrosion alkali aggregate reaction and sulphate attack of significance today is the environmental impact of portland cement manufacture and focus is directed towards reducing the resulting co emissions more efficient use of portland cement through the use of supplementary cementitious materials scms and the development of alternative cements are amongst the key research strategies adopted by industry and academia in addressing this current research the cements research group within the department of chemistry at the university of aberdeen have research activity over a broad range of areas professor macphee is currently involved in several areas reactivity of glassy aluminosilicates glass reactivity is of interest across a range of technological themes in geology the weathering of igneous and metamorphic rock types is through glass reaction with its exposure environment in waste management glasses are used as primary matrices for the immobilisation of high level nuclear waste and as reactive constituents in cementitious matrices for low and intermediate level nuclear wastes in construction as with cementitious waste forms portland cements are commonly extended with glassy aluminosilicates such as coal combustion fly ash or blastfurnace slags understanding the reactivity of these materials therefore has technological importance our focus is on the use of aluminosilicate glasses as supplementary cementitious materials scms and funding from the european industryacademic network nanocem has enabled detailed dissolution rate studies including time resolved solution analysis mipoes and high resolution surface characterisation tofsims and

of photocatalysts in construction is one of the most sustainable technologies for atmospheric depollution globally concrete structures are ubiquitous in the built environment their surfaces are exposed to solar radiation at varying intensities dependent on latitude season time of day angle of exposure and local weather conditions and they represent significant surface areas which particularly in urban settings are typically exposed to the highest levels of air pollution our interests range from the fundamental processes activated in an illuminated semiconductor photocatalyst through the role of the photocatalyst surface on performance to the influence of cement chemistry on these processes we have recently completed a european project lightcat under the european union’s seventh framework programme fp which led to the development of a visible light tiobased photocatalyst with a high degree of selectivity for nitrate during the photocatalytic oxidation of atmospheric

outside of the cement chemistry theme photoresponsive materials for fuel cell and related applications the commercial uptake of low temperature fuel cells has been limited by the durability of the membrane electrode assembly mea amongst the most common of the mea failure modes is the poisoning of the platinum anode electrocatalyst by adsorbed carbon monoxide co entering the fuel cell in the fuel where hydrogen is derived from the reformation of hydrocarbons or if in a direct methanol fuel cell dmfc from fuel oxidation  co adsorption can rapidly degrade anode performance at concentrations of only a few parts per million in the fuel fuel purity therefore adds cost to the fuel cells cost of ownership through fuel and component replacement costs as well as in the fuel cell down time our research in this field grew from our studies on tungsten oxide photocatalysis for water purification and a recognition that the expected drop in a dmfc test cell electrode performance was

and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the commission or in which the commission is a party and without admitting or denying the findings contained herein except as to the commissions jurisdiction over him and over the subject matter of these proceedings which are admitted macphee consents to the entry of this order instituting public administrative proceedings pursuant to section c of the securities exchange act of  making findings and imposing a ceaseanddesist order order iii on the basis of this order and the respondents offer the commission makes the following findings a respondent donald j macphee age  from  through june  was the chief financial officer of igi inc igi a diversified company engaged in producing and marketing animal health products such as poultry vaccines veterinary pharmaceuticals cosmetics and skin care products at the direction of the former president of igi macphee engaged in improper sales cutoff practices failed to adequately record sales credits in a timely manner and engaged in improper accounting practices regarding igis inventory in late june  macphee alerted igis outside counsel about financial irregularities at igi and in july  he departed igi for health reasons macphee is not now and was not at the time of his misconduct a certified public accountant b other relevant persons and entities igi inc is located in buena new jersey igis common stock is registered with the commission pursuant to section g of the exchange act and is listed for trading on the american stock exchange the president who was also igis chief operating officer directed macphee and other former igi officers and employees to engage in fraudulent accounting practices from  through  that caused igi to overstate its assets revenues and net income igi terminated the president in november  c summary this matter involves fraudulent accounting practices and reporting internal controls and books and records violations at igi throughout   and during the first two quarters of  igis former president manipulated the companys annual and quarterly earnings by directing macphee among others to engage in improper accounting practices that caused igi to overstate its assets revenues and net income former senior management manipulated igis earnings by failing to  write off inventory that was defective or that had been destroyed  record sales revenue in the proper accounting periods and  process and record sales credits in a timely manner these accounting improprieties primarily concerned igis production and storage of mareks a poultry vaccine that is used to inoculate chickens against cancer during the relevant time period igi derived most of its revenues from the sale of poultry vaccines of which mareks was the most important and other animal health products rather than writing off the cost of large quantities of destroyed or defective vaccines the former president directed macphee to establish reserves which the former president then used to achieve his desired financial results the former president also directed macphee among others to hold open igis books at the end of the quarters so he could inflate igis quarterly revenues at the direction of the president macphee also did not record sales credits in the appropriate time periods macphees actions in part caused igi to overstate its assets revenues and net income d facts  overstatement of inventory and understatement of related expenses from  through the second quarter of  igi while macphee was chief financial officer overstated its assets and net income by not recording properly the costs associated with reductions in its inventory for large quantities of mareks that were either destroyed or were defective and could not be sold in connection
