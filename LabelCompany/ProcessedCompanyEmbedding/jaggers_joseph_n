aviation have been inspirational httpwwwquadaorghalloffamepersonneljaggershtm i served with mg jaggers when he was the commander of tcata at west fort hood our organizations mission was to test equipment for use by the us army there were a lot of politics with our testing and that of our sister unit on the east coast once we tested a shaped charge designed to help the infantryman create an instant fox hole our testing revealed that the charge could make a fox hole out of the soldier the powerstobe were not happy with that test result later we tested tac fire an artillery firing system we scored it as a no go because of radio frequency issues among other problems  it was sent back to us again and again for subsequent retesting several times but each time we failed it mg jaggers was not one to easily roll over mg jaggers was the most private of generals i had the pleasure to serve he did not like to be disturbed in his office we installed an intercom so he could maintain his privacy i could go on with this story but will leave it at that he wanted immediate access to his colt  caliber semi auto but required me to safeguard it for him i guess you might have called me his arms man i found myself on several ocassions bringing or receiving his weapon for purposes of securing it a small pistol but effective he retained this pistol when he retired he was fairly laid back for a general officer but demanded his coffee in one specific way he required it the old fashion army way brewed with egg shells and a pinch of salt you can believe that if it was not ready in that manner when he arrived each morning it was a major issue i learned to have it setup on a timer the evening before he was famous for working late hours one time he left early and i was slow to have his general officer flag brought in from the front of the building maybe an hour later i heard about it the next morning  apparently all the other senior officers would not leave at the end of the day until they saw that standard removed from the front of building another time i was embarrassed  my wife and son were waiting outside for me my son kept calling for me to come on finally gen jaggers came out of his office and told me to go home i learned the politics of seating general offiers together there was a strict protocol for seating arrangements gen jaggers relied on me to make those seating arrangements as confusing as possible sometimes so that some officers did not have to sit next to a particular other it was a real challenge at times i could tell you some stories but will not general jaggers was an extremely knowledgable and capable officer but medical problems forced him into early retirement i was allowed to leave the unit on his retirement   d patrick        photo
