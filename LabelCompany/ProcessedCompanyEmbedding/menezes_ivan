of control drinking has consequences the director of rape crisis network ireland said diageo blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them the belief that drunk girls are ‘asking for it’ is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it  this is a harmful regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner this latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning the outofcontrol campaign which started by asking women if they were ‘embarrassed’ while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape in november  diageo announced its intention of selling at auction sir edwin landseers

the birthplace of the brands founder and production hub since  in december  diageo provoked controversy over its decision to change its cardhu brand scotch whisky from a single malt to a vatted

successful after a meeting of producers diageo agreed to make changes on  february  diageo restated last fiscal years earnings under us accounting rules reducing net income by  million pounds or  million in  the cardhu brand quietly changed back to being a single malt in july  diageo announced that after nearly  years of association with the town of kilmarnock scotland they would be closing

scotlands annual awards if brewdog was to be named winner of the best bar operator award diageo was forced to issue an apology in  diageo offended survivors of rape and sexual abuse with an advertising campaign showing a young girl crying with her makeup smeared as her sister looks at her from the doorway and the caption whos following in your footsteps out of control drinking has consequences the director of rape crisis network ireland said diageo blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them the belief that drunk girls are ‘asking for it’ is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it  this is a harmful regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner this latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning the outofcontrol campaign which started by asking women if they were ‘embarrassed’ while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape in november  diageo announced its intention of selling at auction sir edwin landseers iconic  painting the
