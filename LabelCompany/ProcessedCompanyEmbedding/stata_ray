the stata center is located on the site of the former building  demolished in  building  was erected hastily during world war ii as a temporary building to house the historic radiation laboratory over the course of  years its temporary nature allowed research groups to have more space and to make more creative use of that space than was possible in more respectable buildings the building also provided permanent rooms for official institute clubs and groups including the tech model railroad club and the electronic research society professor jerome y lettvin once quipped you might regard it as the womb of the institute it is kind of messy but by god it is procreative architectural criticismedit boston globe architecture columnist robert campbell wrote a glowing appraisal of the building on april   according to campbell the stata is always going to look unfinished it also looks as if its about to collapse columns tilt at scary angles walls teeter swerve and collide in random curves and angles materials change wherever you look brick mirrorsurface steel brushed aluminum brightly colored paint corrugated metal everything looks improvised as if thrown up at the last moment thats the point the statas appearance is a metaphor for the freedom daring and creativity of the research thats supposed to occur inside it campbell stated that the cost overruns and delays in completion of the stata center are of no more importance than similar problems associated with the building of st pauls cathedral the  kaplannewsweek guide how to get into college which lists twentyfive universities its editors consider notable in some respect recognizes mit as having the hottest architecture placing most of its emphasis on the stata center though there are many who praise this building and in fact from the perspective of gehrys other work it is considered by some as one of his best there are certainly many who are less enamored of the structure mathematician and architectural theorist nikos salingaros has harshly criticized the stata center an architecture that reverses structural algorithms so as to create disorder—the same algorithms that in an infinitely more detailed application generate living form—ceases to be architecture deconstructivist buildings are the most visible symbols of actual deconstruction the randomness they embody is the antithesis of natures organized complexity this is despite effusive praise in the press for exciting new academic buildings such as the peter b lewis management building at case western reserve university in cleveland the vontz center for molecular studies at the university of cincinnati medical center and the stata center for computer information and intelligence sciences at mit all by frank gehry housing a scientific department at a university inside the symbol of its nemesis must be the ultimate irony former boston university president john silber said the building really is a disaster architecture critic robert campbell praised gehry for breaking up the monotony of a street of concrete buildings and being a building like no other building the style of the building has been likened to german expressionism of the s galleryedit stata center view from the th floor interior ground floor gates tower building  at night lawsuitedit water spray from a fire sprinkler system failure in  on october   mit sued architect frank gehry and the construction companies skanska usa building inc and ner construction management for providing deficient design services and drawings which caused leaks to spring masonry to crack mold to grow drainage to back up and falling ice and debris to block emergency exits a skanska spokesperson said that prior to construction gehry ignored warnings from skanska and a consulting company regarding flaws in his design of an outdoor amphitheater and rejected a formal request from skanska to modify the design in a  interview gehry whose firm had been paid  million for the project said construction problems were inevitable in the design of complex buildings these things are complicated he said and they involved a lot of people and you never quite know where they went wrong a building goes together with seven billion pieces of connective tissue the chances of it getting done ever without something colliding or some misstep are small i think the issues are fairly minor he added mit is after our insurance mr gehry said that value engineering—the process by which elements of a project are eliminated to cut costs—was largely responsible for the problems there are things that were left out of the design he said the client chose not to put certain devices on the roofs to save money the lawsuit was reportedly settled in  with most of the issues

grew consistently at a rate of about  percent per year then for the first time between  and  we missed our fiveyear goals — and by a country mile true enough like other semiconductor companies we were affected by the malaise in the us electronics industry and by the strong dollar but the external environment was only part of the problem something was also wrong internally and it had to be fixed but what was the problem we had the largest share of our niche market in highperformance linear integrated circuits we had the best designers and technologists in our business we had excellent relations with a highly motivated workforce we were not guilty of underinvestment nor of managing for shortterm profits the only conclusion was that there was something about the way we were managing the company that was not good enough so i set about to understand what was wrong and how to make it better in the s our plight was not uncommon in corporate america companies that for decades enjoyed world leadership in their markets were being brought to their knees of course there are many purported reasons for the loss of us competitiveness the high cost of capital an overvalued dollar a deteriorating education system overconsumption at the expense of investment government regulations misplaced emphasis on military as opposed to economic security and undisciplined government spending certainly all contributed to this decline however many who have studied the situation believe that the root of the problem is our declining rate of innovation if this is true then the challenge lies in better understanding innovation and in determining how to do more of it usually we think of innovation in terms of technologies that give rise to a new class of products or to improvements in the design and manufacture of existing products but at analog devices and many other us companies product and process innovation are not the primary bottleneck to progress the bottleneck is management innovation peter drucker points out that the rise to industrial dominance of great britain germany and the united states was based on technological innovation in engines electricity chemistry aviation agriculture optics and so forth japan is the first nation whose rise to industrial power was clearly based on management innovation not technological innovation in the traditional sense read the full

stata or the stata center though the building number is still essential in identifying rooms at mit above the fourth floor the building splits into two distinct structures the gates tower and the dreyfoos tower often called g tower and d tower respectively the building has a number of small auditoriums and classrooms used by the electrical engineering and computer science department eecs

was erected hastily during world war ii as a temporary building to house the historic radiation laboratory over the course of  years its temporary nature allowed research groups to have more space and to make more creative use of that space than was possible in more respectable buildings the building also provided permanent rooms for official institute clubs and groups including the tech model railroad club and the electronic research society professor jerome y lettvin once quipped you might regard it as the womb of the institute it is kind of messy but by god it is procreative architectural criticismedit boston globe architecture columnist robert campbell wrote a glowing appraisal of the building on april   according to campbell the stata is always going to look unfinished it also looks as if its about to collapse columns tilt at scary angles walls teeter swerve and collide in random curves and angles materials change wherever you look brick mirrorsurface steel brushed aluminum brightly colored paint corrugated metal everything looks improvised as if thrown up at the last moment thats the point the statas appearance is a metaphor for the freedom daring and creativity of the research thats supposed to occur inside it campbell stated that the cost overruns and delays in completion of the stata center are of no more importance than similar problems associated with the building of st pauls cathedral the  kaplannewsweek guide how to get into college which lists twentyfive universities its editors consider notable in some respect recognizes mit as having the hottest architecture placing most of its emphasis on the stata center though there are many who praise this building and in fact from the perspective of gehrys other work it is considered by some as one of his best there are certainly many who are less enamored of the structure mathematician and architectural theorist nikos salingaros has harshly criticized the stata center an architecture that reverses structural algorithms so as to create disorder—the same algorithms that in an infinitely more detailed application generate living form—ceases to be architecture deconstructivist buildings are the most visible symbols of actual deconstruction the randomness they embody is the antithesis of natures organized complexity this is despite effusive praise in the press for exciting new academic buildings such as the peter b lewis management building at case western reserve university in cleveland the vontz center for molecular studies at the university of cincinnati medical center and the stata center for computer information and intelligence sciences at mit all by frank gehry housing a scientific department at a university inside the symbol of its nemesis must be the ultimate irony former boston university president john silber said the building really is a disaster architecture critic robert campbell praised gehry for breaking up the monotony of a street of concrete buildings and being a building like no other building the style of the building has been likened to german expressionism of the s galleryedit stata center view from the th

skanska usa building inc and ner construction management for providing deficient design services and drawings which caused leaks to spring masonry to crack mold to grow drainage to back up and falling ice and debris to block emergency exits a skanska spokesperson said that prior to construction gehry ignored warnings from skanska and a consulting company regarding flaws in his design of an outdoor amphitheater and rejected a formal request from skanska to modify the design in a  interview gehry whose firm had been paid  million for the project said construction problems were inevitable in the design of complex buildings these things are complicated he said and they involved a lot of people and you never quite know where they went wrong a building goes together with seven billion pieces of connective tissue the chances of it getting done ever without something colliding or some misstep are small i think the issues are fairly minor he added mit is after our insurance mr gehry said that value engineering—the process by which elements of a project are eliminated to cut costs—was largely responsible for the problems there are things that were left out of the design he said the client

china opening if you ask john kerry he would love boston to still host the next uschina climate summit but boston mayor marty walsh remains less enthusiastickerry the former secretary of state and us senator reached out to walsh recently to say “i’m prepared to be helpful”last june kerry and walsh were in beijing attending the uschina summit when they announced that boston would host this year’s gathering but the election of donald trump and his subsequent pullout of the paris climate agreement put that plan on holdthe forum brings together dozens of mayors from both the united states and china to discuss how they can reduce carbon emissions the united states and china are the world’s two biggest carbon emittersa looming concern is without federal support could the city invite chinese officials and could those talks be effectivekerry in an interview said he doesn’t see a problem“whenever foreign dignitaries travel to the united states we afford them the dignity and respect of their positions    whether it is on official business or not” he saidas secretary of state kerry helped craft the paris climate accord in which  countries agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions along with a deal with iran it was one of kerry’s signature accomplishments as america’s top diplomatalong with forging stronger climate change policies walsh had touted the uschina summit as a way to show off the city to chinese leaders that could create economic opportunities in an interview on wgbh radio last week the mayor didn’t think the conference could have the same impact with the united states out of the paris agreement“we are not having a gathering or meeting for the sake of having a meeting” walsh saidstill the mayor hasn’t given up completely on a climate change forum perhaps one that would feature just us mayors — shirley leung karter biking across us most businesspeople in boston know trish karter for dancing deer baking co the company she ran for more than a decadebut karter is

head of ge’s health care business “jeff immelt is a terrific leader” kraft said in an email “for the past  years he has run one of the largest and most complicated systems as the ceo at general

impressive accomplishments during his tenure as ceo among them deciding to move ge’s headquarters to boston last year kraft helped to pitch immelt on the merits of relocating here from

creative destruction” » interview with ray stata feb    by christopher vaughan in entrepreneurship interviews kaizen ray stata is cofounder of analog devices inc based in norwood massachusetts as of  adi serves over  customers has  employees and a market capitalization of over  billion mr stata received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering from mit he served as adi’s ceo from  to  and is currently chairman of the board we met with mr stata in norwood to explore his thoughts on bootstrapping a startup leadership in innovative companies and the challenges and opportunities of globalization kaizen you were injured playing basketball in high school in pennsylvania and that led to your going to the massachusetts institute of technology stata right it was quite fortuitous that i jammed myself in a wall and injured my neck so i ended up in a hospital for several days—in traction next to me there was an elderly gentleman who had spent his career as an engineer by that time as a sophomore in high school i already was thinking about engineering as a career i didn’t know much about engineering or anything about engineering schools so i used this opportunity to quiz this guy he told me a lot about what engineers do and about the best engineering schools what came out loud and clear was “if you want to become an engineer and get an engineering education there’s really only one place to consider the massachusetts institute of technology” he said “just focus on mit and go there it’s the best” i had never heard of mit but when i returned home i started reading up on mit and set my sights on going there kaizen mit is expensive but you came from a family with limited means how did you pay for your education stata well mit has what they call a “needblind admissions policy” which promises that if you are admitted and you don’t have any money you can still go they have various means to help you through loans scholarships and also back in those days they required you to work a fair amount—cleaning rooms working in the libraries whatever you had to earn part of your keep but nonetheless you could go there without any financial resources really it’s one of the many great things about mit it turns out that i had won a fouryear nrotc naval reserve officers training core scholarship unfortunately mit didn’t have the nrotc program the other school rensselaer that i considered and was admitted did with no money it was a struggle to give up this scholarship and if it hadn’t been for that chance meeting in the hospital and the advice i received i don’t know that i would have had the perspective or courage to make that decision but fortunately i did kaizen what is the most valuable thing you learned in college about how to be successful stata i come from small town farm country in pennsylvania where in our small high school i was top of the class but you don’t know where you stand in the world at large when you live in oxford pennsylvania when i went to mit i found that everybody was like me—they had all graduated at the top of their classes so i found myself competing academically with the best and brightest from around the world i soon learned for sure that i wasn’t the brightest of those who attend mit but on the other hand i learned i was bright enough to compete and do well that gave me the selfconfidence to always set ambitious goals and believe i could achieve them kaizen your education was in electrical engineering—did anything in your formal education help prepare you for your career as an entrepreneur and business executive stata yes there were many things for one thing discipline and hard work are essential to survive and succeed at mit it is a grinding experience i learned to use my time wisely and of course problemsolving skills and analytical thinking are fundamental principles of an engineering education and for me electrical engineering was the technology base for my company analog devices being well grounded in the technology gave me a bottomup understanding of our products and how they were applied by our customers and besides that mit—only a few years before i went there—made a major shift by introducing humanities as an important component of undergraduate education for me the history of western civilization was totally captivating and fascinating it introduced me to philosophy and to the great thinkers of the ages and got me started on a lifelong process of learning more and more about our intellectual heritage and about the human side of the equation and of thinking more deeply about principles values and the purpose of life the other thing about mit is for a long time it has been a hotbed for entrepreneurship so it’s like—monkey see monkey do if you see others start companies and become successful you say “if they can do it so can i” whereas if you don’t see that up close and personal there’s a fear and a mystery about how to do it can i do it the entrepreneurial spirit at mit gives you confidence if you want to start a company just do it kaizen after receiving your bachelor’s and master’s degrees from mit in the late s you went to work for hewlettpackard mostly in sales and marketing what did you learn good or bad from your experience at hp stata i had decided early on even in high school that i wanted to start my own company someday primarily because i had an aversion to authority and i wanted to be my own boss therefore when i got out of mit i wanted to learn about business so i picked what was clearly one of the premier corporations in america at that time with great leadership i took a job in sales because i thought seeing business through the eyes of customers was the best way to get a perspective of what makes business tick now it turned out but i didn’t know it at that time that hewlettpackard was a pioneer in adopting the stakeholder model that is the purpose of business is not just about creating stockholder wealth it’s about meeting the needs of all the constituents—employees customers and stockholders—in a scenario where everybody wins hp was also one of the early companies that embraced douglas mcgregor’s ideas about the human side of enterprise—theory y versus theory x—a cultural belief about people that they’re innocent until proven guilty that they want to do a good job if given the opportunity and resources and that they are honest and ambitious that you don’t have to beat them with a stick to get them to perform hewlettpackard really embraced these principles so for me hp was my mini mba program where i learned by watching and doing the culture i established at analog devices and the way i ran the company were built on my observations and experiences at hp it was a great company kaizen did you have natural marketing and sales talent or did you have to work at it stata sales was certainly not a natural talent i’m basically an introvert and a nerd at heart sales responsibility forced me to learn how to engage with people and to hold productive conversations as opposed to “you don’t bother me i don’t bother you” which is more the instinct of a nerd i also found that the particular style by which i engage with people worked remarkably well although you would never consider me a typical salesman particularly at that time that is i had a commitment to really understand the products so that when i engaged with customers i brought value to the conversation also i have a natural predilection toward listening and understanding customers’ problems and what they are trying to accomplish based on my knowledge i was able to help them objectively understand the alternatives and what i had to offer i learned you really don’t sell technology intensive products you basically facilitate buying decisions also my way of being is to build trustful relationships through competence honesty sincerity and reliability which are all valued by customers all those things taken together worked out to where i wasn’t a bad salesman although that wasn’t my natural talent kaizen after three years at hp in  you cofounded solid state instruments with matthew lorber and bill linko whom you knew from mit stata right we met at the instrumentation labs at mit where we all worked together the instruments labs were pioneers in inertial navigation systems among other things they designed the polaris submarine missile system so we all had experience with instrumentation and control systems we shared an urge to start a business and so we said “hey let’s just do it” we didn’t have a strategy of any kind really we didn’t have any money we just had an urge we figured we’d find some way to exploit our common knowledge of instrumentation and control systems in part by doing some consulting on the side and by focusing on gyrotest instrumentation kaizen at this point you were  years old what was the most difficult thing about launching the company stata well first we didn’t have any money we survived on sweat capital with no salaries my wife didn’t know what she was getting into i quit my job just as we were getting married and she supported me but the biggest problem which i didn’t understand at the time i jumped into the pond was that we were a partnership there was no real boss we were all our own bosses so to speak and since we didn’t really have a clear strategy and direction for the company there was continuous debate about what to do and how to do it which led to dissention and the lack of alignment amongst partners so with no money it was a real struggle kaizen ssi was later acquired by kollmorgen corporation’s inland controls division what about ssi was attractive to them was it that they wanted to have you three on board did they like your products stata we ended up developing a precision rate table for testing gyros which used kollmorgen’s direct driven motors and precision tachometers this product was one reason they were interested but more importantly their goal was to build an electronic controls division to complement their motor division they saw us as a way to create a technology foundation to implement the electronic control side of their business kaizen so they offered you  each in stock and you stayed on as vicepresident of marketing stata right in   was a fair amount i continued my focus on figuring out what products to develop and how to sell them matt lorber basically drove engineering and bill linko was the division head with responsibility for operations but still there was no real boss we signed a twoyear contract and worked hard as a matter of fact we were successful in delivering what they wanted so it all worked out for us and for them and we learned a lot about starting and growing a new business so we were better prepared the next time kaizen in  you cofounded analog devices inc with mr lorber stata that’s right matt and i decided early on that we would do a good job in fulfilling our twoyear employment contract but beyond that we were going to look for an opportunity to start another company based on the dissention at solid state instruments we decided that three is a crowd so we jettisoned one of our partners and brought it down to two kaizen how did the idea for the new company arise stata matt and i spent nights and weekends talking about what to do next at the time as a company designing and manufacturing instruments you had to build products from the ground up—that is you had to design and manufacture all your circuits one of the critical circuits in instrumentation is the operational amplifier which amplifies and conditions analogbased signals operational amplifiers largely determine the performance of analog instruments and systems after a short time in business new startups emerged that offered operational amplifiers as standard products which we could buy versus design and make ourselves we analyzed the economics of specialization and the economics of scale and concluded that as a small instrument company we would be much better off to focus our resources on instrument design and to buy components like opamps so we switched from make to buy that’s when the light went off wow if we made that decision why wouldn’t a growing number of instrument companies come to the same conclusion and besides as customers for these products we had good insights into strengths and weaknesses of our wouldbe competitors and believed we could beat them so we decided to go into competition with our suppliers and design and manufacture operational amplifiers which we already knew how to do kaizen you had some capital from the sale of your first business ssi did you need to raise more stata we didn’t as a matter of fact once we decided that opamps would be our next business we hired a consultant even while working at kollmorgen to develop a line of products so that when we opened the doors we would be ready to go we helped on nights and weekends to give direction but we were careful not to actually do the engineering work ourselves to avoid any conflict with our current employer with this head start by the end of the first year analog devices was already profitable our nest egg from the sale of solid state instruments was sufficient to get us to breakeven in those days venture capital was virtually an unknown idea banks served that purpose so we worked out a deal with the first national bank of boston to fund our growth for every dollar we earned the bank would loan us a dollar which is like a onetoone debttoequity ratio unheardof these days we essentially bootstrapped the company’s growth with bank loans the implication of this approach is that you have to kill to eat—every day you’ve got to earn those profits we were growing  a year and making good money because it was a virgin market and we had superior products and better sales and marketing we went public in late ’ just four years after starting the company the primary reason for the ipo was not to raise money but to facilitate the exit of my partner from the company kaizen what was your initial division of labor with mr lorber stata matt was mr inside he did the engineering and manufacturing thing i was mr outside deciding what products we should design driving the sales and marketing processes and tending to the administrative aspects of the business kaizen there were some difficulties that led to mr lorber’s wanting to leave in  or  what happened stata we had a pretty clear strategy we knew what we wanted to do and we were being very successful at doing it the major problem was that as soon as we got to the point where the company was worth anything matt wanted to sell but i wanted to continue to build the company that was the fundamental problem and besides it was still a partnership we called it a twoheaded monster since neither accepted the other as the boss as a myriad of little problems arose along the way there was no authority to resolve them so we spent a lot of time hassling over little things it worked and we were friends but it was hard successful partnerships are rare the problem was resolved by matt selling half his stock at the ipo and leaving it is unusual for a founder to sell shares at an ipo and leave but there was a hot ipo market at that time kaizen after mr lorber left you wanted to concentrate on development and marketing so you hired a president to run the company why didn’t that work out stata neither matt nor i had a very clear idea of what the ceo of a public company was supposed to do we both felt we needed a more experienced executive we thought that the important stuff was deciding what products to make getting them designed getting them manufactured and selling them—for us that’s what business was all about my view was that the ceo was like a super clerk an administrator that took care of assigning the parking spaces and raising money you know administration that is how naïve i was so we hired what we thought was a competent executive but he was not technical and didn’t really understand our business and as we got into it surprise surprise to me he began to assert himself in areas where i had ownership and where he didn’t really have any understanding this led to conflict and again to questions about who had the authority to decide what but in this case the ceo had a clear idea about who had the authority this forced me to do some soul searching my motivation in starting a company in the first place was that as i said i have a significant aversion to authority and i don’t like being told what to do—i want the freedom to control my own destiny it’s built into my dna and personality so i realized that if i wanted to avoid the hassles with partners and now with the ceo i had better figure out what a ceo is supposed to do and learn how to do it so i went to the board of what was now a public company and convinced them i could provide better leadership than the person we had especially since his deficiencies were beginning to show even though i didn’t have any experience as the ceo of a public company the board gambled and put me in charge the first thing i did was to stand up in front of all the employees and say “for all these reasons we’re going to change leadership i don’t have a clue about how to be a president but i’m going to take the next twelve months to learn and if at the end of that twelve months you guys collectively decide or if the board decides that i’m not the person who can provide leadership i’ll step down but in the meantime while i’m learning you’ve got to help me” so everybody dug in and there was then no way i could fail over the next twelve months i learned how to be a president and that process has continued for four decades kaizen concurrently adi then shifted from assembling components to manufacturing highperformance linear integrated circuits what convinced you that that was an important move to make what data and trends were you looking at stata just two years after we started analog devices the first monolithic integrated circuit ic operation amplifiers opamps were introduced to the market the way we manufactured opamps was to manually assemble resistors transistors and capacitors on printed circuit boards it was a very laborintensive primitive approach to manufacturing with semiconductorintegratedcircuit manufacturing you automatically fabricate these components through complex materials processing techniques with little labor required while the manufacturing cost of ic’s integrated circuits was more than an order of magnitude less performance wasn’t adequate to meet the requirements of our markets but each year the performance of linear ic’s was dramatically improving as i dug into it and learned more about ic’s i concluded that while we would continue to do well for the foreseeable future eventually ic technology because of its dramatically lower cost would take over i was not sure when or exactly how but for me the hand writing was on the wall either we learned how to design and manufacture linear ic’s or we would have a shortlived history kaizen but it was hard to sell that idea inside the company why stata nearly everyone in the company and on the board disagreed we were very successful growing rapidly and making high profits it was a classical case of what clayton christensen at hbs later called the innovator’s dilemma why would you want to redirect resources to a riskier business about which you know little when your current business was so successful another argument from our engineers was that ic technology would never perform well enough to meet our customers’ needs others argued that large semiconductor companies already had a head start how would we ever catch up the financial types argued that we didn’t have the financial resources to invest in expensive manufacturing equipment and compete with the giants and finally the clinching argument was that nobody in the company knew anything about how to design or manufacture ic’s by then we were a public company the board was unanimous in saying “ray this is just too risky we can’t do it” kaizen to make it happen you set up a separate company nova devices with a can’tsayno offer to adi stata right i couldn’t accept their conclusion the greater risk would be to do nothing so i make an offer the board could not refuse that is i agree to pledge my analog devices stock to fund a group of engineers from a boston company who i knew wanted to start a linear ic company the deal was that the new company nova devices would design and manufacture the ic’s and analog would sell them if nova devices succeeded analog devices would have the option to buy at a fixed option price with no gain to me in order to avoid a conflict of interest if the company failed i would suffer the loss the board thought i was foolish but they couldn’t say no fortunately it worked since as i believed ic’s did eventually completely obsolete our early manufacturing technology kaizen but when you were making that decision there was a confidence in your own judgment about what the trends were you didn’t really think it was going to fail stata yes i believed we could do it but still there were big risks i correctly observed that we didn’t need to worry about competition from the large semiconductor companies since their strategy was to supply what we called “jelly beans” that is to accept whatever performance they could achieve from standard high volume semiconductor manufacturing processes our challenge would be to figure out how to compensate for the variances in semiconductor manufacturing processes in order to achieve performance acceptable to our customers who demanded performance and were willing to pay for it to achieve high performance from our assembled products we had to manually select resistors and then later we learned to sand blast thick film resistors to compensate for the variances of the discrete transistors we used we were able to transfer this learning to ic manufacturing by depositing thin film resistors on the surface of the ic’s and then laser trimming these much smaller device structures we would follow a market driven innovation strategy to optimize performance whereas the semiconductor industry at that time was focused on manufacturing process innovation mostly to reduce cost this lack of competition gave us time to work out more complex manufacturing techniques kaizen the idea worked and at the same time the older assembled boards were declining nova was then acquired by adi and became very profitable at what point was it really clear that you had made the right decision stata actually the assembled products business continued to grow and make good profits for many years but in a few years after nova devices had its ic fabrication facility up and running and analog devices had demonstrated success selling ic products the risks declined to a point where our directors concluded “okay let’s acquire nova devices and get serious about the ic business” still within the company the engineering community questioned if ic performance could ever catch up with assembled products it took five to seven years before the naysayers finally surrendered especially since there was a big learning curve to get the cost of ic’s to the point where profits were comparable to assembled products fortunately assembled profits continued to grow and make money to support the ic learning curve kaizen you became ceo in  was it an easy transition for you personally stata not really i remember very vividly thinking “how do i learn to become a president” fortunately in digging around i found that the american management association had an organization called the president’s association the ama reserved this program for presidents only and particularly for new presidents the program was developed and delivered by presidents who had gone through this learning experience themselves it was a oneweek course given in acapulco my wife and i hadn’t vacationed for a long while so i figured what did we have to lose although it didn’t turn out to be much of a vacation it was a marvelous learning experience my mental models got much clearer what is my job how do i go about doing it what are the important challenges in leading a company this was my mba program crammed into a week even more important i got acquainted with the most impressive instructor in the program who himself was a ceo of a modestsized company i invited him to become director of analog devices and he accepted he became my mentor and he also taught others over many years at analog devices what i learned about management and leadership in mexico by the end of the first year with the benefit of that experience and with the growing success of the company everyone at analog devices including the directors had confidence that i could do the job and so did i over the next thirty years i continued to learn as the company grew and faced new challenges kaizen you are now ceo and your job includes highlevel management earlier you mentioned learning a lot at hp and you have also said that running a company “is nothing more or less than meeting the needs of the employees for selfactualization” what selfactualization needs do you mean here stata one of the most important constituents in the hp model are employees in my view if you satisfy ambitious employees then in their own selfinterest they will be motivated to meet the needs of customers and stockholders particularly if you share the results of success the question is what are the needs of employees and how do you address them maslow’s hierarchy of needs is the best model at the bottom of the hierarchy are basic needs for survival food and shelter money to pay the bills and also a sense of security about your job is important the need for socialization through affiliation with interesting thoughtful and caring managers and coworkers ranks high along with recognition and rewards for achievement but the last step of maslow’s hierarchy selfactualization is the most important especially for ambitious professional workers people want to reach their full potential and become all that they can possibly become they value a work environment where they are not limited in terms of their growth and development potential but rather are encouraged and supported to achieve their personal goals employees’ goals are best achieved in a company with a winning strategy that builds alignment and confidence in shared goals and objectives employees want a voice in deciding how to achieve their personal goals and the goals of the company kaizen you are known for your antiauthoritarian leadership style and bright innovative people don’t like being told what to do so an authoritarian style won’t work well how then do you lead with this leadership style stata you’re right to some degree nobody wants a boss everybody wants to do their own thing they want to pursue their own purposes prior to wwii the operative assumption of american management was that employees would and were expected to sacrifice their personal goals and interests for the privilege of working for a company and earning a living that assumption began to breakdown in the ‘s with greater education achievement and job mobility and with more women in the workforce as second breadwinners management has been forced to recognize that people have legitimate purposes of their own and the onus shifted to management to help employees achieve their personal goals in order to retain the best and brightest the real challenge then is how to achieve alignment between the purpose of the whole the enterprise and the purpose of the parts employees teams divisions etc voluntarily without heavyhanded command and controls management practices have been evolving over the past  years to address this challenge for example the notion of shared vision within a culture which makes it clear that as the company achieves its purpose it is important that the people who make it successful will in the process fulfill their purposes as well it’s okay in fact desirable for employees to have their own goals and purposes the job of management is to merge the interests of the company with the interests of employees kaizen one element you emphasize here is listening skills—what goes into being a good listener stata you don’t come up with winning strategies by sitting alone in your office you have to build on the knowledge and the intelligence that exists in your company and in the environment by listening to customers and employees and learning you sense and respond to change and opportunity in contrast to companies and people who say “i already know it” how the leader or leaders approach conversations can influence the listening skills of an organization my approach although i don’t always practice what i preach is to listen first and then speak i often say that if god had intended us to speak more than listen he would have given us two mouths and one ear it’s not natural to listen and then speak human beings aren’t built that way they want to first speak and then maybe listen it takes discipline and practice to become a good listener when you encounter views that are different from your own your instinct is to shout them down and refute conflicting opinions but it is more productive to inquire whyhow others reach different conclusions what are the facts and reasoning that lead to a different opinion you have to stay open to the possibility that other views if you understand them may be better than yours or you may discover common ground that is better than your views alone or you may gain perspective to be more effective in your advocacy but it pays to listen kaizen the ceo is also the bigpicture decider and has to be decisive—at the same time you have said that you must be open to the fact that you could be wrong how do you do that stata well that’s a continuing challenge because on the one hand when you make a decision you want to display confidence and enthusiasm for your position you want to drive ahead without ambiguity but on the other hand as andy grove said in his book only the paranoid survive there has to be coexistence of confidence on the one hand but concern on the other the future is characterized by a set of assumptions not by facts as the future unfolds you have to be factdriven and continuously monitor the facts to either validate your assumptions or raise questions about inconsistencies don’t deny the facts respond to them it’s what the japanese call a “weakness orientation” an openness to the possibility of being wrong and an orientation to always be looking for a better way russell ackoff one of the great systems thinkers of our age makes the point that you never actually learn from doing things right surprisingly because you already know it your greatest source of learning comes from making mistakes but only if you admit the mistake diagnose the reasons and learn from the experience you have to establish a culture where making and admitting mistakes is acceptable this has to start at the top the leader has to lead by example “we thought we had it right but as it turns out here are the reasons we didn’t and here is what we’re going to do to correct the situation incidentally i take full responsibility” kaizen so when you have cases where there are disagreements within a company and the leader has made a decision if the leader has communicated that he’s open to facts open to change then that’s going to go down a lot easier stata after listening to differing points of view in most instances a group reaches a consensus so that everyone is happy and aligned with the conclusion but if not it is important that everyone signs up to support the conclusion with no secondguessing but after a reasonable time new facts or information may justify a reexamination you want everyone to believe that you will not deny the facts if the plans and assumptions are not holding up the resolution of differing points of view and process for reaching a consensus is itself a very important part of making decisions if you enter a conversation one group to another or one person to another with an attitude of “i already know it” then your only goal is to impose that view on others but if you enter a conversation with the point of view of “this is what i think and why tell me what you think and why” you stimulate mutual learning that may lead to more informed judgments and decisions so again listening skills and learning to balance inquiry and advocacy are key to reaching and implementing the best decisions kaizen that comes up in customer relations as well stata right as i mentioned earlier a lot of selling is not selling it’s about listening to customers learning their concerns and their needs and then making offers “i understand your issues what about this would this work for you or not” but you have to build trustful relationships before customers will openly share their concerns that will permit you to make constructive offers kaizen leadership also means handling strategic challenges for example adi had great growth until the mids— per year on average and by  adi’s stock was worth  times what it had been in  but starting in  sales suddenly went flat and you had to restrategize stata it was a crisis because after consistent growth year after year all of a sudden sales flattened and our profits dropped it was not a happy time we had initially focused on instrumentation military electronics industrial controls medical electronics areas where high performance products were required in relatively low volumes but with attractive profits that was the nature of our business but as peace broke out military sales shriveled the japanese were invading many of our customers markets the dollar was strong which impeded exports everything was going wrong not just for us but for the entire american semiconductor industry that was the bad news but for analog devices the good news was that for the first time there were new markets that in the past had no interest in the performance we could deliver—they just wanted jellybeans at the lowest possible cost—that all of a sudden needed what we had the first evidence was when sony with their compact disc players came to us as the leaders in converter products to discuss their needs for high performance digital to analog converters they needed to get costs down and we had integrated circuit converters that few others had while they would buy millions they would only pay  when we were getting  for bit digital to analog converters from instrument companies admittedly in much lower volume so we refused they went to our competitor the only other company that could achieve this performance and they said yes within a few years our competitor was cranking out these products by the millions and in fact selling them at  and making a profit that was a huge wakeup call kaizen at that point was it that you didn’t think you could do them for  or that it wasn’t worth your time to do them for  stata some of both first we all thought “why sell for  what you can get  in other markets” that’s great except the market for the  ones was tiny and not growing we had never made a million of anything so we had to come to grips with the fact that if you manufactured in very high volume you could dramatically reduce the costs and the price but to do it would require a dramatic transformation of the company kaizen so what changes did you as ceo decide the company had to make stata first we had to centralize manufacturing and learn how to manufacture in high volume with high quality previously we had a highly decentralized structure organized around technology every division had their own manufacturing facilities everybody did their own thing in their own way but to achieve the cost required we had to centralize manufacturing introduce total quality management techniques and standardize our processes which were seen as the antitheses of innovation which had always driven our success we had to accept the fact that innovation alone was not enough for continued success we also had to excel in manufacturing there was huge resistance to making these changes the people who were running the divisions said “unless i control my own manufacturing you can’t hold me responsible for profits” the engineers in the united states and ireland who were in fact competing with each other with different technologies were now being told “you’re all going to be part of the same product group you’re going to use the same fab and you’re all going to have to get along with each other” they came back and said “i don’t like those guys they have a funny accent but more important i can’t manage engineers unless they’re within walking distance of my desk let alone  miles away remember this is high technology we are talking about managing highly creative people” of course history has disproven these myths but at the time people felt deeply about their beliefs the hard part of making changes of this magnitude is unlearning the things that have made you successful and changing your beliefs about what is important and what is possible the changes required were so dramatic that we created a motto “creating the new analog” which i used in meetings with employees around the world to explain what we were doing and why it took years to pull it off but we finally succeeded kaizen you mentioned that the changes in analog were considered the antithesis to innovation how did you maintain innovation in this new centralized and standardized environment stata it’s not an eitheror world it’s innovation and manufacturing excellence either one alone would not work in addressing the new high volume growth opportunities so we had to evolve manufacturing excellence in a way that it didn’t destroy our capability to innovate that is hard to do in fact so hard that the strategic thinking of that era was that companies had to make a strategic choice either to be an innovator or a low cost producer you can’t be excellent at both ends of the spectrum it starts with a change in mindset that is to believe that you can and must be excellent at both while we standardized manufacturing processes we still looked for opportunities to differentiate and to optimize product performance not just cost but no doubt it takes greater skills to design breakthrough products when you are constrained to use standardized manufacturing processes to attract and retain the very best circuit designers we implemented a technical parallel career ladder early in the company’s history many companies have parallel ladders but they don’t work in the sense that engineers who want to make progress in their careers believe they have to become managers to achieve their goals at analog we’re saying “if you want to continue to be a great engineer for your whole career we’ll provide opportunities and rewards that are commensurate with managers if you ascend the ladder and achieve technical excellence” the highest rank of the parallel ladder is analog fellow fellows at analog do extremely well financially and they are recognized and valued not only for their technical contributions but also for their judgment and views about policy and strategy and how to make the company a great place to work to sustain an innovation culture when there are competing interests to optimize cost you have to demonstrate in big ways and small that innovation counts for example we spend  of sales on rd we hold a technical conference annually at which  engineers from around the world give papers and learn from each other it costs millions even in this disastrous year where we are scraping to save every nickel we didn’t cancel the conference this spoke volumes about the importance of innovation as i have already said how you respond to failure is critically important as an innovative company we have to take risks not every program succeeds kaizen the transformation worked—by  analog devices had  employees and sales of  million thirty years earlier the company had been two guys working out of their basement when you look back on that spectacular growth how do you feel about your role in making that happen stata i never imagined we would become a billion dollar company we just took it one step at a time solving problems and addressing the opportunities that would take us to the next step i have a deep sense of pride shared by everyone in the company that we not only continued to grow but that we emerged as the undisputed leader in high performance linear integrated circuits worldwide that’s because we continue to attract and retain great innovators in our ranks and because we figured out how to turn jellybeans into high performance ic circuits long before anybody else did for me and many others analog has been a vehicle for personal growth and development i was pushed by the company’s success to learn in order to keep up with the requirements of my job as a result i grew as did many others well beyond what anyone could have imagined possible it is very satisfying to have seen so many people develop to their full potential and become leaders in our industry kaizen you’ve also received many honors you’re a member of the american academy of arts and sciences and the national academy of engineering a recipient of the  ieee founder’s medal and of the  ace lifetime achievement award from the editorial board of ee times do those add to your sense of accomplishment stata well i certainly appreciate these honors but what’s more important is my own inner sense of selfesteem for what i accomplished having said that i can’t deny that recognition is a basic human need if we get recognition from people and organizations we respect it reinforces how we feel about ourselves kaizen looking back on your years as ceo what was the thing you consistently enjoyed the most stata it’s really creating something that in some small way will change the world by creating new market opportunities and new solutions for human needs entrepreneurship has always been the most interesting and exciting thing for me even as analog grew larger it doesn’t always work but when it does work it’s very satisfying kaizen most companies fail as they get bigger—inertia complacency bureaucracy leadership mistakes how did adi succeeded at avoiding those pitfalls stata we’ve had our share of mistakes and problems for sure but maybe one of the differences goes back to what i talked about earlier—a weakness orientation a discipline to look at the facts to not deny the facts and the willingness and ability to change and respond as we see things in the world around us changing nothing fails like success unlearning is the most difficult part somehow we’ve been able to avoid getting hung up by past success i have also mentioned some of the challenges and approaches to keeping innovation alive a big part of this is sustaining your capacity and willingness to take risk it takes constant vigilance as a larger company to assure that everything doesn’t have to be perfect and guaranteed before taking action kaizen one biggerpicture survival issue is whether the united states will remain the world’s innovation leader around the world where are the new rising centers of technological innovation china india brazil ireland stata the two that come up most often are india and china and what role they will play in the world of innovation in the future there’s no doubt that the united states has been and is still today the technology leader—we’re still way way ahead but at the same time these countries are continually learning and growing they’ve got great universities that are getting better and huge populations from which to draw talent so it is evitable that the technology gap will narrow over time but in many ways we have met the enemy and it is us it is what we do or don’t do that will make the difference the thing i worry most about is the decay of our k education system by many objective measures we are losing ground also there is a disturbing erosion of america’s spirit of selfreliance entrepreneurship and free market orientation kaizen you have made personal investments in india why india especially stata the iit’s indian institutes of technology are india’s premier technical universities but to a large extent they have not played the role that mit and stanford have played in promoting entrepreneurship and economic growth there is a group of professors at iit madras who  years ago went back to india after graduate education and work experience in america with the mission of making their university more like mit and other great research universities in america as you get older you look at opportunities to make a difference i thought if somehow i could help them achieve this important and ambitious goal that will be very rewarding that’s why i’ve done it kaizen the us’s two biggest centers of technical innovation have been california’s silicon valley and massachusetts’s route  corridor the proximity to the great universities stanford and berkeley mit and harvard have been essential here one study i saw noted that in massachusetts alone over  mit graduates have founded companies currently generating over  billion in worldwide sales stata there is lots of evidence that indicates a strong influence of research universities on economic development for the simple reason that on the one hand they produce the graduates with the skills and knowledge to fuel the development of leading edge technologies and companies and on the other hand they generate knowledge and ideas that lead to new products and markets today there are many excellent research universities in states other than in california and massachusetts so technology intensive industry is diffusing more broadly in america over time we’ll see this model also working in china india and many other countries around the globe fortunately there is plenty of opportunity for everyone at the leading edge of technology kaizen yet you worry that we are producing too few engineers why do you think this is so is that a problem at the university level or at the k level stata the biggest problem is our k education system our research universities are by far the best in the world but forty percent of students who begin engineering studies drop out due to inadequate preparation in mathematics if we don’t get that fixed there is no way america can sustain leadership in technologybased industries moreover for a lot of complicated reasons engineering as a profession is not held in high esteem in the same way as medicine law and finance sixty percent of the students who attend mit come from families where they are the first generation to attend college engineering has always been a primary career path for upward economic and social mobility in america but second and third generation college going families don’t see engineering as attractive as other careers in my opinion that is a distorted view science and engineering careers are very exciting that’s the source of entrepreneurs who start and build great companies and it doesn’t help that high school teachers and guidance counselors have no idea what engineers do so students are not encouraged or inspired to explore engineering as a career as a result not enough of our best and brightest are motivated or prepared to study engineering and you have to be motivated since engineering students generally have to work harder thus we find ourselves as a nation dependent on immigrants to staff our technical workforce especially at the graduate level sixty to seventy percent of our engineering graduate students are foreignborn as economies of developing countries improve the best and brightest will stay home to study and work that is a frightening prospect kaizen as globalization intensifies the us is increasingly outsourcing not only manufacturing but innovation and design when did that trend become noticeable stata manufacturing outsourcing for hightech companies started two or three decades ago but over the last decade high tech companies started moving design offshore analog devices has established design centers in shanghai beijing and bangalore we did it for two reasons number one to augment the longterm growth of our engineering staff in the middle of a recession it’s hard to remember but in the good times it has been a problem to hire enough engineers in america we are establishing engineering design organizations in china india and elsewhere to take advantage of the talent base which is growing rapidly in these countries in the shortterm engineering salaries are less there overtime the salary gap will decline but the talent gap will grow number two the markets for technologybased products is growing more rapidly in china india brazil wherever for example china today is the largest market for cell phones and these countries are making huge investments to build their infrastructure in communications health care energy and transportation to participate in this growth you’ve got to have engineers who can speak the language and understand the culture so in part it is longterm business development and in part it’s longterm organizational development kaizen so we need more engineers but we also need engineers with a broader range of knowledge and skills—what you call “renaissance men” engineers stata right we’re finding that it is very very challenging to be at the top of your game as an engineer first the technical knowledge required is both deep and broad often cutting across multiple disciplines and products are so complex that it often takes large teams of engineers with different specialties working across international borders that requires human skills and communication skills to encourage collaboration and manage teams with quite varied backgrounds and experiences and engineers must understand the financial implications of manufacturing and product development cost as well as customer requirements and where products should be positioned in the market with respect to competition the most successful engineers truly are “renaissance men” and not just technical specialists engineering schools are aware of these emerging requirements and they are searching for ways to enhance the human side of the equation which is often characterized as leadership skills but in general they are not happy with the results so far kaizen so your ideal college education would be rigorous engineering combined with business and liberal arts education stata the liberal arts component of education in engineering schools is extremely valuable but it doesn’t bring closure on what you need to know in the same way as the technical side when you graduate as an engineer you have a body of knowledge that prepares you to go to work the faculty thinks very carefully about how to integrate this body of knowledge into a coherent program on the liberal arts side there is a smorgasbord of literature history music economics philosophy and whatever without as much attention to how the pieces fit together and that’s okay there is value in accommodating a broad range of student interests but at least some aspects of engineering education should focus specifically on what you need to know on the human side to be a successful engineer it is hard to fit this broad education agenda into a fouryear degree so many engineering schools are concluding that it takes five years a master’s degree to prepare graduates to become professional engineers four years is still an adequate technical background for those who wish to pursue graduate programs in law medicine business or elsewhere kaizen in addition to all of the above you have served on the federal executive committee of the council on competitiveness you gave major funding for the ray and maria stata center complex at mit and you are currently mentoring and funding several entrepreneurial startups where does all of your energy come from stata well we don’t exactly know from where our motivations arise they just happen to us i can say i developed the capacity and discipline for hard work from an early age no doubt this was influenced by the fact that i was raised in farm country where people work extremely hard and are very selfreliant and i do have good health and stamina but then there is the motivation to accomplish something in life that came from sources which at least for me i don’t understand kaizen is it habitdriven or passiondriven that leads you to want to work hard stata i think it’s both on the one hand we do develop habits andor inherit habits that take on a life of their own a place like mit as i mentioned forces you to be disciplined and work hard or you don’t survive that reinforced my natural inclination maybe to the point that it became an addiction like the blackberry who knows but there is no doubt that i am a workaholic on the other hand they say that some people work to live while others live to work i find purpose satisfaction and fulfillment in my work so in that sense work is not work it is something i want to do to return to maslow’s hierarchy of needs and selfactualization through work i continue to learn and to develop in many different ways i find ways to have an impact on the world around me and i’m able to enrich the experience and lives of those i care for i can’t imagine life without work kaizen you also have a family friends and other interests but each day has only so many hours how do you approach achieving your career goals with achieving your other life goals stata that’s a continuing challenge the most important thing i did to help with that dilemma was to have married a woman who has supported and encouraged me to do what i do she took on a lot of the responsibility of raising our children and for looking after the necessities of life she’s given me degrees of freedom that i truly appreciate and honor our success has been a true partnership without that support and without good health it would not have been possible to keep up the pace of work what i’ve observed is that most of the successful people i see around the planet don’t have balanced work lives they have a passion for work that dominates their lives that’s not to say that family children grandchildren hobbies sports vacations travel are not important too but when it comes down to it most of their time is centered around their career and their work because it’s so satisfying kaizen in closing for younger people starting out what is the most important thing they should know stata well maybe i can pick a couple first one way or other you’ve got to be good at something even though that something will no doubt change over time as you enter your career strive to achieve excellence at whatever you do back to some of the things we talked about you soon find out that you don’t get very much accomplished in life on your own now there are exceptions like musicians artists and writers who can go off on their own and accomplish remarkable things but most of us find that we accomplish more by working in concert with others to leverage our combined skills and competencies i’ve found that one of the most important factors in being a leader or more generally in engaging with people is to build trustful relationships what does that mean trust is built on honesty integrity reliability sincerity competence conduct yourself so that people can depend on what you say and what you do on the fact that you’re more often right than wrong on the fact that you meet your commitments on the fact that you are straight with people and tell it how it is if people trust you and you trust them you can get a lot more out of relationships and out of life this interview was conducted for kaizen by stephen hicks to learn more about ray stata please visit wwwanalogcom   stephen r
