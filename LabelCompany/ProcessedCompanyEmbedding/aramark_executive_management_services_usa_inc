surface all that is most marketable about you we can help classify skillswhich if selectively described to employers can often make the difference each year about  percent of the clients who contract our services have settled for less in the past simply because they have been unable to communicate their most marketable assets and skills one client was earning a  base after almost  years three years later she is earning  another executive came to us at less than  and a year later landed a ceo role at more than double that amount the key in both situations was that we packaged positioned and promoted their true assets if you are like most executives you can increase your averages of maximizing your compensation by way of specifically identifying each and every marketable asset and

building systems are you experienced with c level searcha “c” level search engagement requires steadfast expertise industry comprehension and a firm that truly recognizes what makes high level transition happen” john h seraichyk circa  founder browning associates weve written the book on “c” level and senior management job hunting however rather than a lengthy dissertation the objective of this communication is to provide you with a sense of what we do it lays out our general philosophy for opening doors and creating opportunities for senior level executives we have worked with thousands of executives who have contracted our services for a myriad of career searchcrisis related scenarios whether employed or unemployed the challenges and obstacles for a high level executive seeking change are countless according to the us bureau of labor statistics less than  of the workforce population earns in excess of k annually furthermore the report reveals that less than  of all professional and executive jobs offering an annual compensation of k  are advertised the bureaus report clearly articulates that if you are a senior executive you are a minority and available career positions are extremely difficult to attain of course any worthwhile venture is never an easy one landing a new position at your level requires a steadfast action plan you need to be highly aggressive while maintaining confidentiality of your employment information imagine trying to market yourself to the masses while simultaneously having to make certain that nobody finds out its a bit of an oxymoron but for an employed executive confidentiality is paramount you need to implement a strategic search plan that will enable you to market your credentials to the appropriate individuals who can make or recommend a hiring decision browning associates will ensure you achieve that goal your  résuméto be or not to be there is a great deal of controversy surrounding executive résumés here is the reality believe it or not we do not use a résumé as a method of introduction for most of our senior level clients a résumé screams “hire me” or worse it may cause an unwanted breach of your confidentiality not so fast less is more at your level you need to step back identify the proper hiring authorities and then craft an alternative strategic method of formal introduction utilizing our network of growth companies key decision makers and client alumni we will introduce you in such a way that the potential employer is given just enough information to inspire interest while your competition is bombarding the hr department with droves of paper and electronic boilerplate résumé submissions we will promote your credentials to each and every one involved in the hiring process many times your initial credential submission will come complete with a referral from our client network this is when our employment contacts become most valuable to you eventually the hiring authorities will request your résumé when this occurs we will schedule a time for you to bring one directly to the company or schedule a phone interview for an initial review at browning associates we all agree that the résumé is to be however proper usage as illustrated above is essential senior executive search and our experience when you are a “c” suite or senior level executive you cant simply peruse the classifieds for your next career position it is imperative that you retain the necessary tools to undertake a search campaign that will result in a position that takes advantage of your complete requirements including salary location and desired industry it is not likely that youll find “c” class positions in your local classified ads or on the internet not only are these career positions in high demand but it is difficult to even get your foot in the door if you are to land one of these coveted positions you need to position a team in your corner who knows the requirements of the market and who can maximize your preparation to be a viable contender for a “c” level job opening possessing the necessary skill sets to secure a highpaying and professionally satisfying position as a “c” class executive is only the first step you must put forth a complete package to the potential employer which includes a high impact credential introduction impressive and reliable references and career accomplishments abstract that lets the employer know that your credentials most definitely merit consideration for nearly twenty years we have been in the business of assisting jobseekers especially senior executives in locating the career position that is most suitable to their needs the most desirable career positions will almost always be awarded to the most prepared applicant and browning associates will ensure you achieve maximum career search support that is swift and effective career outlook our research indicates employment of top executives—including chief executives general and operations managers and legislators—is expected to grow  percent from  to  because top executives are essential to the success of any organization their jobs are unlikely to be automated or exported to other countries some top executive jobs may be eliminated through industry consolidation as upper management is streamlined after mergers and acquisitions employment of top executives is not as sensitive to growth in business as employment in many other occupations as a business grows the number of top executives changes little relative to the total number of employees therefore top executives are not expected to experience as much employment growth as workers in the occupations they oversee projected employment growth of top executives varies by industry for example employment growth is expected to grow faster than average in professional scientific and technical services and about as fast as the average in administrative and support services however employment is projected to decline in some manufacturing industries job prospects keen competition is expected for top executive positions because the prestige and compensation attract a large number of qualified applicants because this is a large occupation numerous openings will occur each year as executives transfer to other positions start their own businesses or retire however many executives who leave their jobs transfer to other executive positions a pattern that tends to limit the number of job openings for new entrants to the occupation experienced managers whose accomplishments reflect strong leadership qualities and the ability to improve the efficiency or competitive position of an organization will have the best opportunities in an increasingly global economy experience in international economics marketing information systems and knowledge of several languages also may be beneficial how do you assist medical doctors seeking changein the preceding five years we have assisted more than two times the number of medical doctors seeking change than we had in the prior decade” john h seraichyk circa  founder executive job search the intent of this communication is to provide you with an overview and understanding of our experience and expertise assisting medical doctors seeking change for a complete explanation of exactly what we can do for you please contact us today yes the medical profession is ever changing and more and more physicians are seeking change how do we know because since  we have spoken with countless physicians medical school leaders business leaders political leaders and like you we watch the news its no secret that the future for physicians has changed even though the extreme sacrifices of hard work and high educational costs remain the majority of physicians we speak with protest their profession due to ever decreasing reimbursements tighter regulations increasing costs lack of security less respect and more and more work from the list above tighter regulation and threatened security are the latest frontrunners with regard to regulation we tell our clients not to worry about the government but do worry about payers accountability measures best practices and clinical pathways medicine has become a business focused on profit and you and your patients are the casualties add to that the “off the record” regulation of patients arriving with reams of internet reports regarding their conditions and the defensive medicine you feel forced to practice to alleviate their demand then include malpractice companies that dont just raise your rates over a claim they discontinue your coverage and in one to six months youre out of practice threatened security is of course the result of all of the above more than one physician has told us that they are one malpractice claim away from losing their practice interestingly these same practitioners had never had a claim filed against them however they all agree it only takes one to close you down payers and insurers are constantly looking for an oversight or a simple discrepancy about care to terminate you from a panel restrict your privilege or put you on the platform for a law suit furthermore many of your wonderful patients see you as a “lottery ticket“ these are people who say “i dont really have any opposition to your practice doc i know you have insurance for this type of thing” can you relate to any of this youve followed a roadmap your entire career undergrad medical school residency… maybe fellowship and then practice but now theres no roadmap you know its time for a new career direction but how do you start well design a roadmap for your new career more importantly well ridebedside” with you as we help you navigate your way to career fulfillment is it possible to make a rewarding change after all these years absolutely medicine is a wonderful education and we know how to transform your education your training and your practice into a nonclinical competence as our client you will be “treated” the way you might treat a new patient first a formal diagnosis of your career situation is prepared next we develop a career search treatment plan and finally we work closely with you to implement your plan diagnosis its sounds easy but you know all too well both the challenge and the importance of the right diagnosis its equally essential and as challenging for your career changesearch treatment developing your career search “treatment plan” is crucial to the success of your career wellness we will utilize our healthcare business entrepreneurial coaching and leadership backgrounds to develop a realworld action plan in an effort to engage your search campaign implementation implementing your searchchange campaign is where all of our intensive preliminary work joins together we will act as your careersearch agents in an effort to identify new opportunities according to the united states bureau of labor statistics less than  off all jobs are advertised the implementation phase of your search is where we begin to confidentially introduce your credentials to key decision makers in your new field of interest as identified through the diagnosis assessment our objective is to look beyond the career positions that are advertised in newspapers trade journals or the internet once your search is underway we will work closely with you throughout the entire search campaign this will ensure our commitment to you and steadfast client compliance imagine how your patient compliance would improve if you met with your patients at least once a week to converse about their plan and their success thats exactly what we will do for you many of our prospective clients often ask us what they could possibly do other than practice our clients have recently interviewed for these positions medical director vice president of clinical services healthcare consultant  medical educator entrepreneur health writer hospital ceo just to name a few according to the us bureau of labor statistics employment of physicians and surgeons is projected to grow  percent from  to  faster than the average for all occupations job growth will occur because of continued expansion of health care related industries the growing and aging population will drive overall growth in the demand for physician services as consumers continue to demand high levels of care using the latest technologies diagnostic tests and therapies demand for physicians services is highly sensitive to changes in consumer preferences health care reimbursement policies and legislation for example if changes to health coverage result in consumers facing higher outofpocket costs they may demand fewer physician services patients relying more on other health care providers—such as physician assistants nurse practitioners optometrists and nurse anesthetists—also may temper demand for physician services in addition new technologies will increase physician productivity these technologies include electronic medical records test and prescription orders billing and scheduling job prospects opportunities for individuals interested in becoming physicians and surgeons are expected to be very good in addition to job openings from employment growth numerous openings will result from the need to replace physicians and surgeons who retire over the  decade unlike their predecessors newly trained physicians face radically different choices of where and how to practice new physicians are much less likely to enter solo practice and more likely to take salaried jobs in group medical practices clinics and health networks reports of shortages in some specialties such as general or family practice internal medicine and obgyn or in rural or lowincome areas should attract new entrants encouraging schools to expand programs and hospitals to increase available residency slots however because physician training is so lengthy employment change happens gradually in the short term to meet increased demand experienced physicians may work longer hours delay retirement or take measures to increase productivity such as using more support staff to provide services opportunities should be particularly good in rural and lowincome areas as some physicians find these areas unattractive because of less control over work hours isolation from medical colleagues or other reasons your future can be changed but you have to take control to achieve permanent transformation contact us today our specialization is your key to success i have been self employed my whole life now what“imagine fore fronting an entrepreneurial venture for twenty years and suddenly your faced with the certainty of going to work for somebody else this is an awakening reality for many entrepreneurs who suddenly find themselves in search of a w or  employment engagement” john h seraichyk circa  founder what we know you would think that after running your own company most employers would be highly interested in you after all as a business owner youve done it all youve built a successful company from the ground up youve sold services andor product youve serviced customers youve managed people youve fixed everything from a broken spirit to a malfunctioning computer youve worked  hour work weeks in the early days you even did your own accounting and payroll does this sound like you with all of your experience vigor and drive to succeed you would think that any company in their right mind would hire you in a new york minute not so fast believe it or not larger and many midsize corporations will not recognize your skill sets as a value add to their company they may be intimidated by your prior successes many corporations are seeking an employee with a steadfast track record working for one of their competitors or in a similar cultural environment many vice presidents and “c” class executives working for traditional organizations have told us time and time again that an entrepreneur placed in their highly structured work environment may actually disrupt the conventional work ethic and management philosophy instilled by traditional management styles we have also been told that many hiring authorities are actually intimidated by the entrepreneurial breed set they feel that somebody who has made their whole career on making their own decisions and directing the decisions of others may be difficult to delegate to as entrepreneurs ourselves we agree that the mindset of many hiring authorities is way off base unfortunately stereotypes are difficult to remove but they can be circumvented we are experts at circumventing stereotypes this is how and why we are and have been industry leaders for nearly twenty years the purpose of this communication is to demonstrate one of the prominent realities that every transitioning business owner will face in the marketplace where do you fit “most business owners will only thrive in a work environment that will enable them to exercise their entrepreneurial spirit” john h seraichyk  we will work with you to find the kind of work environment where you can continue to strive and thrive you need a forward thinking business that will enable you to do what you are best at most entrepreneurs true talents are absolutely thwarted in a traditional  role with rigorous departmental protocols company politics corporate bureaucracy miles of red tape and so on whether you want to work for a small midsize or large corporation the opportunity is out there we are here to help you maximize your most earnest endeavors hopefully this communication has clearly demonstrated our knowledge of at least a few of the many challenges most business owners will face while conducting an employment search for a complete explanation of what challenges you may confront in the job market and what we can do to facilitate your success please contact us today to learn more why hasnt the recruiter called backread this or contact us and we will set you straight on how to make recruiters work for you if you have sent your résumé to an executive search firm or corporate recruiter and have not heard back dont fret even if your skill sets are an exact match for the job you applied for dont expect a call back if you were clever enough to obtain the name and title of the recruiter who is hiring for the position wait  hours after sending your resume and follow up by telephone to confirm receipt of your submission if you are unable to reach your contact person leave a succinct voice mail follow up with an email and wait if you do not hear back within a week call again if you are still unable to reach your contact send one more email and move on assuming you make it to a first interview adhering to what follows should result in more return phone calls positive email communication and ultimately more job offers if none of this works contact us and we will get your resume to the top of the heap whats the first step to getting a job interview getting past the recruiter recruiters are usually your first contact with a potential employer and they often decide whether your resume lands on the hiring managers desk or in a faroff filing cabinet while its important to know the basics of what recruiters do you also need to know what they dont do after all you dont want an inappropriate request to ruin your chances for an interview here are four things you shouldnt ask of a recruiter dont be overly friendly sure recruiters are usually warm friendly and helpful after all its their job to put you at ease and guide you through the hiring process but theyre professional colleagues and its crucial that you never forget it think of the recruiter as a respected coworker and treat them accordingly be friendly but not overly casual or familiar its wise to keep personal conversations jokes and physical contact to a minimum after a tough interview with a hiring manager you may be relieved to see a recruiters smiling face dont be tempted to let your guard down though youre still on even if the interview has ended a useful rule of thumb dont say or do anything in front of a recruiter that you wouldnt say or do in front of your boss or your mother dont expect career coaching the recruiters goal is not to help you get a job its to help you navigate the hiring process at one specific company recruiters arent career coaches its not appropriate to ask them to help you craft your cover letter edit your resume or plan your career path you can ask questions about the company or industry in general but try to relate your questions to the job youre being considered for and save your best most thoughtful questions for the hiring manager  thats who you need to impress most dont ask for insider information theres only one job candidate you really need to worry about you though it may be hard to resist dont ask about who youre up against for a job recruiters generally wont share information about other candidates and asking for specific details about the competition makes you look insecure in your own skills however questions about the hiring process or the position itself are fair game here are a few questions you can feel comfortable asking • are you still interviewing candidates • how large is the current pool of candidates • how would you describe the ideal candidate for the job • is there anything i can do to make myself a stronger candidate the best way to get an edge on the competition make yourself a more competitive candidate dont request special treatment although you may wish you were youre probably not the only candidate for the job and while recruiters are often happy to help their aim is not to be your advocate to the hiring manager their aim is to fill a position never ask a recruiter to put in a good word for you with the hiring manager if they think youre a strong candidate theyll probably sing your praises anyway also dont ask them to relay a message to the hiring manager for you instead of saying tell soandso it was very nice to meet him  send a thank you note taking the initiative and speaking for yourself shows the hiring manager that youre capable confident and conscientious we guarantee to work with you until you accept a new position contact us today could i possibly need help with interviewinghave you ever had what you genuinely assumed was a perfect interview but they never contacted you again well weve had hundreds of highlevel clients who strongly believed interviewing was the last thing they needed assistance with and weve seen them fail miserably when it comes to interviewing and presentation skills you must be fully prepared basically interviewing is no different from any other skill how good would you be at golf if you played only once or twice in the last year browning associates will prepare you fully for each and every interview you attend employers
