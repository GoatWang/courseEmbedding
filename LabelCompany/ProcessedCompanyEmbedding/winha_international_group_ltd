activities             during the nine months ended december   our operations yielded  in net income but only provided cash totaling  the discrepancy between net income and cash was primarily due to our prepayment of  to lease farm land over the next several years in addition our accounts receivable increased by  during the nine months ended december   due to the periodtoperiod increase in sales and the balance of advances from customers decreased by  all of this was partially offset by a  decrease in inventory due to our outsourcing of control over six of our retail stores during the nine months ended december   our operations yielded  in net income and provided cash totaling  the difference between net income and cash provided by operations was primarily caused by an increase in taxes payable of  and a decrease in inventory of  during that period during the nine months ended december   our australian subsidiary sold convertible debentures for net proceeds of  the australian

ended december   we purchased fixed assets for  and spent  to further develop our website resulting in total cash used in investing activities of   we had working capital of approximately  as of december   a decrease of approximately  compared to march   the decrease was principally the result of the investment in the fruit orchards and prepayment of the longterm leases related to the orchards our debt obligations at december   consisted of  in stockholder loans payable on demand since our cash balance far exceeds our debt obligations we believe that our capital resources will be adequate to fund the companys operations for at least the next  months transfer of cash according to prc laws and regulations in the event that we need to finance the prc operations in the future we are allowed to provide funding by means of capital contributions to shenzhen wanha andor loans to zhongshan winha the loans would be subject to applicable government registration and approval requirements we may not be able to complete the registration or obtain these government approvals on a timely basis if we fail to complete such registration or receive such approvals our ability to finance the prc operations may be negatively affected which could adversely affect liquidity and the companys ability to fund and expand its business current prc regulations permit the prc subsidiaries to pay dividends  however payment of dividends is subject to applicable regulatory requirements furthermore cash transfers from the prc subsidiaries to their parent companies outside of china are subject to prc government control of currency conversion the company receives substantially all of its revenues in rmb under the current corporate structure income is primarily derived by the prc subsidiaries under existing prc foreign exchange regulations payments of current account items including profit distributions interest payments and expenditures from traderelated transactions

account items any revenue generated in the prc may be paid to shareholders outside of the prc as profit or dividends without prior approval from safe so long as we comply with certain procedural requirements however the prc government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions if the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands the company may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to the shareholders the inability to obtain the requisite approvals for converting rmb into foreign currencies any delays in receiving such approvals or any future restrictions on currency exchanges may restrict the ability of the prc subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency denominated obligations  the company currently intends to reinvest only earnings in expanding the operations and currently has no plans to pay any dividends future reporting it should be noted that based upon the additional sale of shares by australian winha on january   the company will  no longer be consolidating australian winha and its wholly owned subsidiaries that represent the operations of the company through december   as the sale of shares reduced the companys ownership

     business   in this annual report on form k the terms company we us and our refer to winha international group limited winha international and its subsidiaries through which winha international owns a  equity interest in a single operating company zhongshan winha electronic commerce company limited zhongshan winha and zhongshan winhas several subsidiaries   overview   zhongshan winha retails specialty food products drawn from many regions across china through its chain of dedicated  stores we provide customers with access to a large variety of local food products that can otherwise only be found in the producers region our vision is to promote cultures and traditions that exist throughout china while bolstering local economies and raising awareness of the cultural heritage to date our marketing has occurred exclusively in our retail stores which were seven in number at the end of our last fiscal year on march   during the current fiscal year we expect to add several new retail stores and during the next two years we also plan to develop a multichannel marketing program which will include an online store and a mobile app in this manner we plan to become a source for specialty food products throughout china in the summer of  we expanded the scope of our brand by initiating a franchising program to date we have granted  franchises to stores that purchase food products from our suppliers and retail the products under our brand and trade dress the franchisees pay us a startup fee and monthly management fee for the right to participate in our franchise program   our corporate history and structure   winha international was incorporated in nevada on april   on august   we obtained control of zhongshan winha through a series of contracts the vie agreements executed on august   by zhongshan winha the equityholders in zhongshan winha and our subsidiary shenzhen winha the practical effect of the six vie agreements was to guarantee that any benefit or loss realized from the operations of zhongshan winha would be ultimately realized by our subsidiary shenzhen winha information technology company ltd shenzhen winha because shenzhen winha was to realize the ultimate benefit or loss from the operations of zhongshan winha zhongshan winha was considered a variable interest entity with respect to shenzhen winha under us accounting principles for that reason the balance sheet of zhongshan winha and its financial results have been consolidated with those of the company since august   on november   shenzhen winha exercised its option to purchase the registered equity of zhongshan winha for a price equivalent to us since that date therefore zhongshan winha has been a subsidiary of winha international on may   we completed a reorganization of our subsidiaries the purpose of which was to introduce an australian subsidiary into our corporate structure which will subsequently effect a public offering of its securities on the australian stock exchange winha international owns only  of the outstanding shares in the australian subsidiary therefore the result of the reorganization was that our equity interest in zhongshan winha was reduced by  that  interest was distributed to members of the companys management consultants to the companys management and suppliers to zhongshan winha    after completion of the reorganization in may  the following chart demonstrates our current corporate structure click to enlarge products   with nearly  years of history and  ethnic groups china is known for the variety of its cultures in particular its diverse locallyproduced specialty goods as china covers almost  million square kilometers of land the variation of climate and environment nourished many distinct local folk cultures and traditions that produced myriad local specialty goods   since the turn of the century as the living standard in china has drastically improved the demand for diversified consumer products has risen every year specialty goods which reflect local cultures history and tradition have become increasingly popular gifts for families and friends however due to factors such as limited business investment incomplete infrastructure in certain rural areas low brand awareness lack of sales channels and ineffective marketing the local specialty product business is still at its early stage  in addition with the goal to promote local cultures chinas state council has been actively working to stimulate domestic demand for local specialty goods our business was founded to meet the demand for local specialty goods both fresh and manufactured we rely on direct suppliers across the country to supply products to us we have established supply relationship with  direct suppliers across  provinces of china we expect that our product sourcing will expand in proportion with the expansion of our business  during the past fiscal year which ended on march   most of our best selling products were fresh produce generally delivered direct from the farm to our customer our ten best selling products during fiscal year  were product   sales revenue   mangosteen       year chenjishaodiaohuang wine        kiwi fruit        year chenjishaodiaohuang wine  gift box        american red pear        pitaya fruit        cucumis metuliferus        taiwan sweet nectarine        moon cake of zunlong yayue        superfine gold pear        as the table indicates our sales were dominated during the past fiscal year by fresh produce most of which we sold to the hotel industry however three of the four products that generated the most sales were packaged goods which shows the effect of our retail stores selling from inventory by contrast during fiscal year  all ten of the best selling products were fresh produce in the future as we increase the number of our retail stores our sales of packaged goods will increase as well   on may   we entered into a sales contract with shenzhen zhongbai supply chaim co ltd which will import and deliver to us  boxes of honeycomb honey from australia we intend to highlight this product in our marketing to introduce the chinese market to the special quality of australian honey our expectation then is that sales of honeycomb honey will represent a growing portion of our revenue in the future retail distribution   we currently have seven retail stores  we expect to add more during the current fiscal year each store holds a variety of manufactured food products in inventory and offers farmtokitchen delivery of a wide variety of fresh and manufactured food products all orders placed at a retail store are filled from our central office using our proprietary stocksellstorage software system this system enables us to find products for each store with the optimal delivery performance and best pricing while also monitoring the inventory at each store and its sales performance during fiscal year  only  of our revenue was the result of purchases of inventory located at a retail store  was the result of custom orders placed at one of our retail stores most of these orders were placed by other business establishments primarily hotels with restaurant services in our standard relationship the hotel has entered into a longterm purchase contract with our local retail store as its needs develop the hotel places orders with the local retail store by fax phone or email  the order is placed into our software system and a purchaser at our central office sends a purchase order usually with instructions for the supplier to deliver to the hotel at a designated time our customorder business has grown quickly as we offer significant advantages to our commercial customers over traditional food distribution systems · we make available a wide variety of interesting food options which allow our commercial customers to offer upscale menus to their clientele     · zhongshan winha involves itself directly in the planting decisions of our suppliers with a goal of offering the freshest possible produce on schedules that are favorable to the needs of our commercial customers     · our retail stores endeavor to facilitate ease of business for our customers allowing them to preschedule visits to our store and obtain backdoor delivery of their purchases  in april of  we expanded the marketing channels by opening our restaurant at  changyi road in wuguishan the purpose of the restaurant is less food service than food sampling potential customers are invited to visit the restaurant where our staff of chefs will prepare foods using the produce and products available at our retail stores in this manner our customers can preview both the quality of our products and creative ideas for incorporating our products into the customers menus a small retail store is located onsite at the restaurant where customers can place orders for our products however we expect the restaurant experience to yield sales throughout our system with the success of the restaurant in wuguishan we recently opened a catering business in shaxi town yunnan province our plan is to open additional restaurants during the current fiscal year  our proprietary software enables the administrative staff in our central office to monitor our stores and control inventory and cash flow efficiently although each pointofpurchase has its own bank account all are integrated online so that our finance department can monitor cash balances and crosscheck against inventory turnover franchises we initiated our franchising program in the summer of  today we have  franchisees each operating a single store under our trademark and trade dress our franchisees are geographically distributed as follows class city franchisees firsttier city shenzhen    guangzhou        secondtier city foshan    dongguan    shantou    zhuhai        thirdtier city zhongshan    zhanjiang    jiangmen    huizhou  each franchisee signs a joint cooperation agreement with zhongshan winha for a term of five years renewable on application the agreement gives the franchisee the right and obligation to use zhongshan winhas trademarks and trade name to operate its store as part of zhongshan winhas unified operating system the franchisee is required to purchase its inventory from the suppliers engaged by zhongshan winha and to otherwise comply with management policies developed by zhongshan winha for its franchisees the franchisee is required to pay to zhongshan winha an initial franchise fee and then a monthly management fee both of which are determined by the class of city in which the franchisee is located and the size of its store class franchise fee x floor space management fee monthly firsttier city  rmb  up to  m   rmb       up to  m

initiating our franchise program in the summer of  and through march   we recorded  in franchise and management fees we intend to increase the number of franchised stores during fiscal  and expect revenue from our franchise operations to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue  plans for expansion of market channels   our goal is to become the leading provider of regional food

design photography and online business administration     · mobile store  we unveiled the prototype for our mobile app at the end of august  our mobile app will be searchable on wechat a social network platform that was developed by tencent and has gained its popularity among chinabased smart phone users we worked with a thirdparty developer in creating a sophisticated interface for the mobile app and obtained a public account with wechat that so that our mobile app can be searched and friended by the public at large our mobile app will have two segments pages introducing local cultures throughout china and a virtual store that will provide exclusive deals such as free samples and special discounted items   our goal is to integrate our online presence with our physical presence we anticipate that customers will be introduced to our products at our retail stores andor restaurants then utilize our online store andor mobile app for repeat orders but we will also direct customers in the other direction by periodically sending registered users push notifications regarding featured products and sales items which will in most cases have a direct link for them to easily review and purchase but may also direct them to our local retail store    government regulation   foreign exchange regulation relating to foreign invested enterprises   under current chinese

damages or compensation the product quality law of the prc which was enacted in  and amended in  strengthens the quality control of products and protects consumers rights and interests under this law manufacturers and distributors who produce or sell defective products may be subject to confiscation of earnings from such sales revocation of business licenses and imposition of fines and in severe circumstances may be subject to criminal liability   the law of the prc on the protection of the rights and interests of consumers was promulgated on october   and became effective on january   to protect consumers rights when they purchase or use goods or services all business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods andor provide services to customers   the tort

intellectual property   trademark   during fiscal  our application for trademark protection for our companys tradename winha was approved by the chinese government   domain names   we have an internet content provider license to use the domain name  wwwwinhacom   employees   we currently have  employees all of whom are employed full time  of our employees are located in our central administrative offices the remainder staff our stores and restaurants item a       risk factors   investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk the risks below are those that we believe are the material risks that we currently face but are not the only risks facing us and our business if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion should occur our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your investment   risks related to our general business operation   we may encounter substantial competition in our business and our failure to compete effectively may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue   we are a recently organized company a number of our competitors including taobao gongtianxiacom and techancom are established and have greater resources than we do our competitive strategy is to implement our innovative business model of selling local specialty goods retail on a shopping platform that utilizes both physical stores and virtual stores however we believe that new competitors will enter the market and adopt our business model to introduce new websites mobile applications and services with competitive characteristics we expect that we will be required to continue to invest in improving our services to compete effectively in our markets our competitors could develop a more efficient business model or undertake more aggressive and costly marketing campaigns than ours which may adversely affect our marketing strategies and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   from time to time we need to identify new suppliers of local specialty products if we cannot obtain sufficient supply that meet our standards at a reasonable cost or at all our sales could be interrupted our financial performance could suffer   though each local region generally has abundant sources of specialty products we cannot assure that the specialty products will continue to be available or in the sense of quality and prices accessible to us numerous factors most of which are beyond our control can influence the prices of the supply for local specialty products these factors include to name a few general economic conditions manufacturer capacity utilization vendor backlogs and transportation delays and other uncertainties   if we experience insufficiency of the supply of local specialty products our sales could be interrupted if we do not have inventory to meet the demand which will directly lead to a decrease in our revenue and profit    we may not be able to market our website and mobile store successfully   once we establish a stable and comprehensive supply of specialty products across the country we plan to launch a marketing campaign to fully promote and advertise our website and mobile store the ecommerce industry is extremely competitive though very few if any specialize in local specialty goods there are currently many general online shopping websites both in china and worldwide that sell local products  an effective marketing plan will need to be executed in order to establish a loyal client base and to get our website and mobile application known in the marketplace if we fail to develop such an effective marketing plan and if we are unable to market our website and mobile application successfully to consumers we may not be able to sustain online business operations   we may not be able to find suitable software developers at an acceptable cost   we contract with software developers to further develop and upgrade our website and mobile store and associated backend interface due to the current demand for skilled technological developers we run the risk of not being able to find or retain suitable personnel at an acceptable price we would also need to ensure that the candidates are adequately qualified to develop a website or mobile application that is user friendly free of errors and seamless in design without these developers we may not be able to further develop and upgrade the software which is the most important aspect of our business development   food safety events involving us or our supply chain could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results   because some of our items are perishable food products food safety is a top priority and we dedicate resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe and quality food products however food safety events including instances of foodborne illness have often occurred in the chinese food industry in the past and could occur in the future as a result our stores could experience a significant increase in supply costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve our stores or those of competitors   in addition food safety events whether or not involving us could result in negative publicity for winha or for the industry or market segments in which we operate increased use of social media could create andor amplify the effects of negative publicity this negative publicity as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products we serve may reduce demand for our products and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our online mobile store and physical stores as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types a decrease in traffic to our stores website andor mobile store as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales   we may be subject to product liability claims if people or properties are harmed by the products we sell   products sold through our stores and those to be sold through our website and mobile store are manufactured by third parties some of those products may be defectively produced or manufactured as a result sales of such products through our stores website or mobile store could expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions third parties subject to such injury or damage may bring claims or legal proceedings against us as the distributor of the products we do not currently maintain any thirdparty liability insurance or product liability insurance in relation to products sold through our stores as a result any material product liability claim or litigation could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and managerial efforts in defending them and could have a negative impact on our reputation   risks related to doing business in china   uncertainties with respect to the prc legal system could adversely affect us   we conduct all of our business through our subsidiary in china our operations in china are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in china and in particular laws and regulations applicable to wholly foreignowned enterprises the prc legal system is based on statutes prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value    since  prc legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in china however china has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in china in particular because these laws and regulations are relatively new and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties in addition the prc legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all that may have a retroactive effect as a result we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation in addition any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and managements attention   under the enterprise income tax law we may be classified as a resident enterprise of china such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our nonprc stockholders   china passed a new enterprise income tax law or the eit law and its implementing rules both of which became effective on january   under the eit law an enterprise established outside of china with de facto management bodies within china is considered a resident enterprise meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes the implementing rules of the eit law define de facto management as substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations personnel accounting and properties of the enterprise   on april   the state administration of taxation of china the sat issued the notice concerning relevant issues regarding cognizance of chinese investment controlled enterprises incorporated offshore as resident enterprises pursuant to criteria of de facto management bodies or the notice further interpreting the application of the eit law and its implementation to offshore entities controlled by a chinese enterprise or group further to the notice the sat issued the administrative measures for enterprise income tax on chinesecontrolled offshore incorporated resident enterprises trial on july   or bulletin no  which took effect on september   to provide more guidance on the implementation of the notice pursuant to the notice an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a nondomestically incorporated resident enterprise if i its senior management in charge of daily operations perform their duties mainly in china ii its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in china iii its substantial assets and properties accounting books corporate stamps board and stockholder minutes are kept in china and iv at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often reside in china the bulletin no  provides clarification on the resident status determination postdetermination administration and competent tax authorities it also specifies that when provided with a copy of prc resident determination certificate from a chinesecontrolled offshoreincorporated resident enterprise the payer should not withhold  income tax when paying certain chinesesourced income such as dividends interest and royalties to the chinesecontrolled offshoreincorporated resident enterprise a resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of  on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of  when paying dividends to its nonprc stockholders however it remains unclear as to whether the notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise controlled by a chinese natural person therefore it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case   if the prc tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes a number of unfavorable prc tax consequences could follow first we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of  on our worldwide taxable income as well as prc enterprise income tax reporting obligations in our case this would mean that income such as nonchina source income would be subject to prc enterprise income tax at a rate of  currently we do not have any nonchina source income second under the eit law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our prc subsidiary would qualify as taxexempt income finally it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new resident enterprise classification could result in a situation in which a  withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our nonprc stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our nonprc stockholders from transferring our shares we are actively monitoring the possibility of resident enterprise treatment for the  tax year and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment to the extent possible   if we were treated as a resident enterprise by prc tax authorities we would be subject to taxation in both the us and china and our prc tax may not be creditable against our us tax     prc regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to prc entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our prc operating subsidiary which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business   as an offshore holding company of our prc operating subsidiary we may make loans to our prc subsidiary or we may make additional capital contributions to our prc subsidiary any loans to our prc subsidiary are subject to prc regulations for example loans by us to our subsidiary in china to finance its activities cannot exceed statutory limits which is the difference between the total investment and the registered capital of our prc subsidiary and must be registered with the state administration of foreign exchange or safe on august   safe promulgated circular  a notice regulating the conversion by a foreigninvested company of foreign currency into rmb by restricting how the converted rmb may be used circular  requires that rmb converted from the foreign currencydenominated capital of a foreigninvested company may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the prc unless such investments are otherwise provided for in the business scope the foreign currencydenominated capital shall be verified by an accounting firm before converting into rmb in addition safe strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of rmb funds converted from the foreign currencydenominated capital of a foreigninvested company to convert such capital into rmb the foreigninvested company must report the use of such rmb to the bank and the rmb must be used for the reported purposes according to circular  change of the use of such rmb without approval is prohibited in addition such rmb may not be used to repay rmb loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used violations of circular  may result in severe penalties including substantial fines as set forth in the foreign exchange administration rules in addition the safe promulgated the notice on relevant issues concerning strengthening the administration of foreign exchange business or circular  on november   which requires the government to closely examine the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings and the net proceeds to be settled in the manner described in the offering documents    we may also decide to finance our subsidiary by means of capital contributions these capital contributions must be approved by the ministry of commerce of china or mofcom or its local counterpart we may not be able to obtain these government approvals on a timely basis if at all with respect to future capital contributions by us to our prc subsidiary if we fail to receive such approvals our ability to capitalize our prc operations may be negatively affected which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business   governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment   the prc government imposes controls on the convertibility of rmb into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of china prior approval from safe is required where rmb is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of china to pay certain capital account items such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies as well as the proceeds of the liquidation of assets   we receive substantially all of our revenues in rmb under our current corporate structure our cash flow is primarily derived from dividend payments from our prc subsidiary under existing prc foreign exchange regulations payments of current account items including profit distributions interest payments and expenditures from traderelated transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from safe by complying with certain procedural requirements as profit and dividend are current account items our revenues generated in the prc may be paid to shareholders outside of the prc as profit or dividend without prior approval from safe so long as we comply with certain procedural requirements   however the prc government may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for payments of profit and dividend if the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders   our inability to obtain the requisite approvals for converting rmb into foreign currencies any delays in receiving such approvals or any future restrictions on currency exchanges may restrict the ability of our prc subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency denominated obligations    fluctuation in the value of the rmb may have a material adverse effect on the value of your investment   the value of the rmb against the us dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by among other things changes in political and economic conditions on july   the prc government changed its decadeold policy of pegging the value of the rmb to the us dollar under the new policy the rmb is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies provisions on administration of foreign exchange as amended in august  further changed chinas exchange regime to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand from  to  the exchange rate between the rmb and the us dollar remained relatively stable since september of  however the chinese government has reduced the value of the rmb three times for an aggregate reduction of almost four percent substantially all of our revenues and costs are denominated in rmb and a significant portion of our financial assets are also denominated in rmb we principally rely on dividends and other distributions paid to us by our subsidiary in china any significant revaluation of the rmb may materially and adversely affect our cash flows revenues earnings and financial position and the value of and any dividends payable on our ordinary shares in us dollars any fluctuations of the exchange rate between the rmb and the us dollar could also result in foreign currency translation losses for financial reporting purposes   prc regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by prc residents may subject our potential prc resident shareholders to penalties and limit our ability to inject capital into our prc subsidiary limit our prc subsidiarys ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise adversely affect us   the safe has promulgated several regulations including the notice on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange administration for domestic residents financing and roundtrip investment through offshore special purpose vehicles or circular  effective on november   and its implementation rules these regulations require prc residents and prc companies to register with local branches of the safe before spvs conduct any overseas financing have any change in equity interest conduct any roundtrip investments or have any other material changes in capital or equity interest in spvs an amendment to registration or filing with the local safe branch by such prc residents or prc companies is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise in the offshore special purpose company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company or any other material change involving a change in the capital of the offshore special purpose company  any prc resident shareholders holding direct or indirect interest in our company may be subject to circular  and its implementation rules failure by any such prc residents to comply with circular  and its implementation rules could subject themselves to fines or legal sanctions restrict our overseas or crossborder investment activities limit our ability to inject capital into our prc subsidiary limit our prc subsidiarys ability to distribute profits to us or affect our ownership structure which could adversely affect our business and prospects    risks related to our securities   the companys shares currently trade for less than  per share and thus are a penny stock trading in penny stocks has many restrictions and these restrictions could severely affect the price and liquidity of the companys shares   since commencing trading in august  our stock has traded below  per share our stock therefore is known as a penny stock which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock the sec has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions a penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors for transactions covered by these rules the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities in addition the brokerdealer must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase he must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser consequently the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them these disclosures require a potential purchaser to acknowledge that he understands the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that he can absorb the loss of his entire investment penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume consequently the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to   we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future   the declaration payment and amount of any future

requirements and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant there is no assurance that future dividends will be paid and if dividends are paid there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend    the lack of public company experience of our management team could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of us securities laws   our management lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by sarbanesoxley act of  our management has never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis our management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal regulatory compliance and reporting requirements including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting  any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting

           managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   events affecting consolidation we operate our business in china through zhongshan winha we expect that virtually all of our revenue will be derived from zhongshan winha on august   our subsidiary shenzhen winha entered into a set of contractual agreements with zhongshan winha and its equity owners including an exclusive business cooperation agreement exclusive option agreement loan agreement share pledge agreement power of attorney and spousal consents shenzhen winha through these arrangements assumed operational control of zhongshan winha and became the primary beneficiary of those operations as a result zhongshan winha was considered a variable interest entity with respect to shenzhen winha and as a result from august   through november   the financial statements of zhongshan winha were consolidated with our companys financial statements the control of our operations through these contractual arrangements created risks for our business if zhongshan winha and its shareholders failed to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements or if we suffered significant delay or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements or if legal remedies under prc laws that we relied on were not available or effective our business and operations could have been severely disrupted which could have materially and adversely affected our results of operations and our ability to generate revenue in the prc and could have damaged our reputation to avoid such risk on november   shenzhen winha exercised its option to purchase the registered equity of zhongshan winha from the shareholders of zhongshan winha  upon the exercise of the purchase option zhongshan winha became a wholly owned subsidiary of shenzhen winha the financial statements of zhongshan winha remain consolidated with our companys financial statements but now as a subsidiary

that quarter by the year ended march   our revenue had increased significantly to  due to the opening of new retail stores and the initiation of custommade sales our revenue continued to grow during fiscal year  as recognition of our brand developed and we introduced additional revenue streams in particular during the year ended march   we sold  franchises and recognized revenue of  consisting of upfront franchise fees and monthly administrative fees during the year ended march   we had total revenue of  representing an increase of  when compared with the year ended march   the following table

year ended march   increased dramatically to  due to the dramatic increase in revenue our gross margin increased to  as compared to the  gross margin that we realized during the fiscal year ended march   however gross profit excluding franchiserelated revenue was only  for the fiscal year ended march   the reduction reflected the increased portion of our revenue attributable to our retail stores which have lower margins than our custommade sales  we expect our gross margin to change as additional revenue streams are added although the direction will depend on the relative volume of highmargin revenue sources eg custom made sales franchising online and mobile versus lower margin sources eg retail stores operating expenses selling expenses selling expenses represent the labor cost for our marketing department and retail stores as well as expenses directly related to our marketing efforts selling expense for the fiscal year ended march   was  an increase of  over fiscal  selling expenses increased primarily due to the expanded operations of our retail stores and the addition of a restaurant in fiscal year  we expect our selling expenses to increase in proportion to the number of additional retail stores and restaurants that we open general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march   totaled  representing an increase of  from fiscal year  the increase was due to a stock compensation expense of  that we incurred when we distributed  of australian winha and indirectly  of zhongshan winha to persons who are either affiliates of the company consultants to the company or suppliers to zhongshan winha excluding the stock compensation expense general and administrative expenses increased by only  which was due to the expansion of our overall operations including the introduction of franchise operations and two restaurants as we expand our operations however particularly as we initiate our multifaceted

disclosure controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   our chief executive officer and chief financial officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in ruleae promulgated by the securities and exchange commission as of march    the evaluation revealed that there are material weaknesses in our disclosure controls specifically · we have not achieved the desired level of corporate governance with regard to identifying and measuring the risk of material misstatement because of our limited internal resources we lack key monitoring mechanisms such as independent directors and audit committee to oversee and monitor the companys risk management business strategies and financial reporting procedures     · we have not designed and implemented controls to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in our manual and computerbased business processes which could affect the companys purchasing controls the limits on the delegation of authority for expenditures and the proper review of manual journal entries     · our accounting department personnel have limited knowledge and experience in us gaap and reports with the securities and exchange commission the sec  to remediate the material weakness the management has hired an external consultant with extensive experience in us gaap and reports to the sec who is responsible for assisting the company with i the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with us gaap and ii its periodic reports with the sec   based on their evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the companys system of disclosure controls and procedures was not effective as of march     managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting   management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the securities exchange act of   we have assessed the effectiveness of those internal controls as of march   using the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso internal control – integrated framework  as a basis for our assessment because of inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate  all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations  therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation a material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the companys ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected in the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting we identified four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  these material weaknesses consisted of the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls itemized above  because of the above conditions managements assessment is that the companys internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of march      changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes that occurred during the fourth

receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the shares for the selling security holders but we will not pay any of the selling commissions brokerage fees and related expenses several major ecommerce websites such as amazon taobao and tmallcom offer products similar to what we intend to specialize in these websites vary in size the larger more established websites have key competitive advantages with existing customer bases bargaining power to negotiate product supply prices and experience in managing inventory though we are a small company at this stage we specialize in the growing niche market of selling local specialty goods we differentiate ourselves by combining the local specialty good retail with a multichannel shopping platform consisting of physical stores our online store mobile store and settop boxes for television sets we also provide inperson customer services both presales and postsales through our selfoperated physical stores which is an offering to our customers not commonly available when shopping with other ecommerce companies company description winha retails local specialty products from different regions across china through its selfoperated physical store website mobile store settop boxes for television sets and also carries on wholesale of local specialty products to a regional distributor our innovative business model utilizes a multichannel shopping platform to sell locallyproduced food beverages and arts and crafts that are wellknown across china through our comprehensive shopping platform we provide customers with access to a large variety of local products that can typically only be found in local stores or markets in specific regions we do not directly own our business operation in china we conduct retail business through our variable interest entity zhongshan winha which we control by a series of contractual arrangements  we market and sell the local specialty goods to customers through four retail channels selfoperated physical store online store mobile store settop box store and a wholesale channel a regional distributor our revenue comes from the sales of local specialty goods made through these channels at prices including gross profit margin  selfoperated physical store  we established a selfoperated storefront in december  in zhongshan city in china we plan to establish a second selfoperated storefront in the first quarter of  our selfoperated storefront retails local specialty goods to customers  online store our products are available for purchase at our online store at wwwwinhacom  our goal is to build our website into a onestop shop for local specialty products of all kinds we are working to recruit employees in areas such as graphic design photography and business administration  mobile store we unveiled the mobile store at the end of august  our mobile store is searchable on wechat a social network platform that is developed by tencent and has gained its popularity among chinabased smart phone users  settop box store customers can browse our products on a television set tv screen if they choose to install a preprogrammed settop box on their tvs a settop box turns a tv into a display device customers with a set top box preprogrammed with our product information will be able to view and select products and complete purchases on a tv screen in addition customers will be able to utilize other functions of settop boxes such as accessing internet web pages streaming videos and movies and playing games we have worked with a thirdparty developer and completed programing our store of local specialty products into settop boxes we plan to make our settop boxes available for purchase at our selfoperated stores  wholesale we utilize a regional distributor in hunan province to promote our products to local retail stores we are in the trial stage of the wholesale channel and yet to decide if we plan to engage additional regional distributors vip club program at our existing and any future selfoperated physical retail stores in guangdong province we offer prepaid cards to customers for purchase the prepaid cards are only available for purchase at our selfoperated physical stores in guangdong province not any of our online mobile and settop box stores customers can use the prepaid cards to purchase local specialty products at all of our selfoperated physical retail stores online mobile or settop box stores in connection with prepaid card sales we offer club memberships vip club memberships” to qualified vip customers the “vip club members to receive one vip club membership a customer is required to purchase at once prepaid cards in an amount of rmb  approximately us  and recruit  registered members the “registered members” to our selfoperated physical stores registered members receive special promotions and discounts as do vip club members but unlike vip club members they do not have to meet the thresholds of prepaid card purchase or member recruiting and are not entitled to profit sharing discussed below we plan to grant up to  vip club memberships at the selfoperated physical retail stores in total each individual customer can receive up to three vip club memberships in return for joining the vip club the vip club members receive in cash each quarter a total of  of the quarterly net income of all of our selfoperated physical retail stores in guangdong province on an aggregated basis if these selfoperated physical retail stores on an aggregated basis record net income under the us gaap standard for that quarter the cash award is distributed within  calendar days after each quarter end among the vip club members pro rata according to the number of their memberships if any adjustment is made to the net income amount of the selfoperated physical retail stores after the review or audit by our auditor we reflect the difference in the next immediate distribution in addition when a vip club member refers a new member to the vip club the referrer is awarded in the form of prepaid cards  of the amount that the referee spends on his or her firsttime purchase this vip club membership program is designed to improve the cash flow of our selfoperated physical retail stores at the development stage and enhance their operating performance in the long run by utilizing the vip club members as a marketing force both “net income” and “referral” awards are treated as promotional expenses to promoting selfoperated physical retail stores because the company is in a development stage it has incurred considerable expenses with very limited revenue as a result the company has historically reported a net loss and is currently operating on a going concern basis the company’s expenses at this stage are principally professional fees relating to organizing the company and its subsidiaries our selfoperated physical retail stores which are controlled and managed by zhongshan supermarket is not expected to incur substantial expenses of professional fees as the company does and rather they are only expected to incur costs of sales operating and other expenses in line with revenues generation therefore we expect that when the selfoperated physical retail storess record net income there will most likely be positive cash flow to fund the distribution to our vip club members if the selfoperated physical retail storess encounter insufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund the distribution of cash awards the shareholders of zhongshan supermarket will fund the distribution pro rata in accordance with their shareholdings however they are not under any contractual obligations to do so if any distribution due is not promptly funded we may face legal actions taken by the vip club members and the operation of our selfoperated physical retail stores may be severely disrupted  our principal executive office is located at
