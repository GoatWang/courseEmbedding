about us nanostring technologies nasdaq nstg is a publicly held provider of life science tools for translational research and molecular diagnostics the companys technology enables a wide variety of basic research translational medicine and in vitro diagnostics applications nanostrings products are based on a novel digital molecular barcoding technology invented at the institute for systems biology isb in seattle under direction of dr leroy hood the company was founded in  with an exclusive license to develop and market the technology in  nanostring launched its first commercial instrument system and began international sales operations with its first multiplexed assays for gene expression analysis in  the company launched new applications for the system to support microrna analysis and copy number variation detection and in  launched prosigna® its first in vitro diagnostic product for prognosis of early stage breast cancer organizations performing cancer research biomarker validation and screening and nextgeneration sequencing validation are rapidly adopting the ncounter® analysis system by providing simple multiplexed digital profiling of single molecules the nanostring platform represents a natural digital downstream companion to nextgeneration sequencing and enables researchers to embark on studies that were previously inconceivableleading researchers and institutions are finding that nanostrings ncounter system provides the ideal platform on which to validate their discoveries and translate them into clinically useful diagnostic assays the ncounter system is uniquely positioned to support translational research because it provides more reproducible results than methods requiring amplification and generates highquality data from the difficult sample types common in clinical research including formalinfixed paraffinembedded ffpe tissuesin addition to continuing to extend the applications for the ncounter system in the discovery target validation and routine testing segments of the genomics research market the companys goal is to become the platform of choice for diagnostic testing based on multiplexed gene signatures that can be offered in hospitals and pathology laboratories worldwide following appropriate regulatory approvals these two synergistic areas of business focus provide researchers with a seamless transition

nanostring technologies inc  company profile company profile nanostring® technologies inc nanostring technologies provides life science tools for translational research and molecular diagnostic products the companys ncounter analysis system has been employed in life sciences research since it was first introduced in  and has been cited in more than  peerreviewed publications the ncounter analysis system offers a costeffective way to easily profile the expression of hundreds of genes proteins mirnas or copy number variations simultaneously with high sensitivity and precision facilitating a wide variety of basic research and translational medicine applications including biomarker discovery and validation the companys technology is also being used in diagnostics the prosigna® breast cancer prognostic gene signature assay together with the ncounter dx analysis system is fda k cleared for use as a prognostic indicator for distant recurrence of breast cancer in addition the company is collaborating with multiple biopharmaceutical companies in the development of companion diagnostic tests for various cancer therapies helping to realize the promise of

nonparametric analyses that display differences between subsets of an experiment without making any assumptions about the underlying statistical distribution they display the range of data as well as the extents of each quartile heat maps heat maps use agglomerative clustering a bottomup form of hierarchical clustering that merges pairs of clusters as they move up the hierarchy this makes inferences about the relationships of all data sets to each other and is often used to evaluate gene expression scatter plots scatter plots compare raw normalized grouped or ratio data by plotting individual data points using cartesian coordinates and assigning one variable to each axis they can be used to identify trends in the relationship between two variables with little or no manipulation violin plots violin plots are similar to box plots in that they display the range of data however they also show the density of values along an axis much like a histogram they can be used to illustrate relative gene expression in different cell populations over time histograms histograms display the distribution of data that have been binned into discrete intervals they are used to estimate the probability distribution of a continuous variable system requirements feature specifications supported os versions windows  windows  mac os x  os x  processor pentium core  duo or athlon
