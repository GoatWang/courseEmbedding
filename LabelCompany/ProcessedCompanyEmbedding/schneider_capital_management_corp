investments contain risks and investors should consider the risks associated with investing in these types of funds value investing involves the risk that the fund investment in companies whose securities are believed to be undervalued relative to their underlying profitability will not appreciate in value as anticipated  investing in foreign securities poses additional market risks since political and economic events unique in a country or region will affect those markets and their issuers  stocks of small companies may be more volatile than and not as readily marketable as those of larger companies  investments made in small capitalization companies are subject to a higher degree of market risk because they tend to be more volatile and less liquid when compared to larger more established companies investors should read the prospectus and carefully consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the schneider fund before investing to obtain a prospectus
