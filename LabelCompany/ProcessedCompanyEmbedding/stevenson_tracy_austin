that i have experienced the same thing i worked with a player in the past i just want to tell you that it has been a great experience i wish i had that when i started to play tennis its just a great guidance someone with whom you can build a relationship that can talk to you and ask you questions and you can give advice i hope you experienced the same thing its great i have to congratulate the sanex wta tour for having this partners for success program you know i hope it continues its a great thing you guys go ahead alexandra stevenson well tracy is my mentor as you all know she actually helped me win my first  challenger in midland michigan tracy austin yeah baby alexandra stevenson she has the winning record so far this is before i got assigned to her she just helped me a lot shes a great champion i wish i could be like her someday we have a lot of history going back we both played at the jack kramer club were both from california our moms are very similar they have the same values theyre friends john austin was here with me this week at the us open its a whole family affair its just great that the sanex wta assigned me tracy shes been a wonderful mentor i know its going to keep continuing even though ive graduated shell always be there for me so thank you very much tracy austin thank you well when the wta came to me talking to me about being a mentor i thought it would be such a unique experience and such a fulfilling experience when they came to me and talked about alexandra i thought it would be a perfect fit because alexandra as she mentioned had been coming to our area in the south bay in california for many many years i always loved her game i really liked her personality her bubbly personality i thought that she had a strong desire to learn about the game of tennis the history and particularly about her game she always seemed to want to get more information to try to make her game better that was so enjoyable we actually worked together for a little bit a little bit of coaching whatever that was very pleasurable because she worked a hundred percent every single time that we worked she wanted to learn its been a very enjoyable experience watching her go from a young kid out there on the court trying to find her way has had some successes now more successes in the last year improving her game so much its really been a very fulfilling experience ive enjoyed it as she said i expect this to fully continue i feel like weve graduated in the partners for success program on the wta but i hope to continue to work with alexandra on the phone you know its fun to have somebody that youre working with youre always looking in that paper always making sure how her scores are how her results are its a great thing i came up at  you know with my mom she talks about my mom we had no idea what we were doing we had no idea which tournaments to enter how many tournaments to play theres a zillion and one questions that you would love to be able to ask somebody thats already been there somebody that you trust so i think its a terrific program im available for the next one now wta well be calling tracy austin i understand now that the wta is the first one to instill the partners for success program now the nba mens basketball is starting to do that as well its a terrific thing if you havent been there you dont have the confidence its great to have somebody to ask those questions i feel that weve been successful and i hope we continue our great relationship for all of alexandras career thank you very much end of
