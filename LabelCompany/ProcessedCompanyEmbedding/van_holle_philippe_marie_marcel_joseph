frank vandenbroucke  november  –  october  was a belgian professional road racing cyclist he was the great hope of belgian cycling in the s but a remarkable talent which appeared in his adolescence in athletics and then in cycle racing dissipated in a succession of drugs problems rows with teams suicide attempts and finally being disowned by the cycling world his former wife described him as a cocaine addict he is known to have had numerous drug and family problems and to have attempted suicidecitation needed however vdb claimed in an interview with procyclings daniel friebe three weeks before his death to have made a nearcomplete recovery from the emotional issues that plagued him throughout his career vandenbroucke told friebe i simply realise that the last year and a half have been fantastic for me nevertheless he died of a pulmonary embolism in october  contents  background  career  family problems  drug problems  impersonation  suicide attempt  death  selected victories  see also  notes  references  external links backgroundedit frank vandenbroucke was born in mouscron and grew up in ploegsteert a village in the frenchspeaking region of belgium with facilities for dutch speakers in  when he was four and cycling in the village square he was knocked over by the driver of a rally car his mother said her son didnt cry until doctors cut his cycling shorts the collision led to four operations on his right knee and repeated problems later in life vandenbroucke first tried athletics joining the entente athlétique hainaut in  he became a regional schoolboy championn  he took out a cycling licence with the club in  and won a race at brakel an unnamed acquaintance told the belgian journalist philippe van holle it must have been when i was about  or  and went out training with a friend on the belgian borders as we spun along out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel he looked about  he was still there  minutes later so we picked up speed he just sat there so we picked up the pace again it was still no problem for him i looked over my shoulder and he gave me a halfmocking halffriendly grin in the end we went as hard as we could to try to get rid of him and teach the little brat a lesson because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes but whatever we did he still hung on after about an hour we came into a village called ploegsteert at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said ok im back home now so bye by the way im frank vandenbroucke neither of us had ever met a kid like him in  when he was  vandenbroucke won the national beginners débutant road championship at halanzy he came third in the world junior road championship in athens in  careeredit vandenbroucke turned professional in  with the belgian team lotto the directeur sportif was his uncle jeanluc he won  races in the next six years including liège–bastogne–liège in  from  he made the sports pages more for doping problems failed comebacks depression marital problems and a failed suicide vandenbroucke left lotto in the middle of  to join mapei there he became a teammate of johan museeuw the manager was patrick lefevère vandenbroucke stayed there until the end of  the year in which he won gent–wevelgem two stages and the overall competition of paris–nice and two stages of the tour de wallonie in  he transferred to the french team cofidis the british magazine procycling said three years on a contract worth  million belgian francs £ was a deal beyond vdbs wildest dreams he never suspected that having all that money in his pocket would set off a terrible downward spiral he won het volk and liège–bastogne–liège before sinking into a doping controversy that was never satisfactorily explained see below  even though vdb was cleared by the courts the team suspended him while the allegations were investigated and relations with their star rider never recovered when he came back he showed well in the  vuelta before remarkably managing to finish in the front group of the world championship despite fracturing both hands en route contractually obliged to stay with cofidis vdb had a poor  season by this point people in cycling were talking more about vdbs nights out than his riding at cofidis he shared leadership with david millar his noncommunication with millar was publicised and criticised it was with cofidis vandenbroucke said in his autobiography that he met the french rider philippe gaumont it was gaumonts confessions of drugtaking in the team that led to the socalled cofidis scandal that included a raid by drugs police on millars house and the british riders suspension for two years and his disqualification from the world timetrial championship he had won gaumont vandenbroucke said in his life story suggested he take a drug trip by mixing stilnoct a sleeping aid with alcohol gaumont described vandenbroucke as a wild man of cycling it was gaumont vandenbroucke said who introduced him to bernard sainz with whom his name would be connected in alleged drugs scandals see below that year was vandenbrouckes best he won liège–bastogne–liège omloop het volk and stages in paris–nice and the vuelta a españa his win in liège–bastogne–liège was so dominant that some called him a genius of cycling because he said on television where he would attack it was however his last year of major victories in  he moved to the italian team lampre then to the belgian team domofarm frites the following year rejoining lefevère and museeuw vandenbroucke stayed with lefevère when he started the quick stepdavitamon team in  and he came second to peter van petegem in the tour of flanders vandenbroucke said he was happy with his performance that he had attacked van petegem on the last climbs because he knew van petegem would beat him in the sprint but lefevère criticised him for lack of effort and vandenbroucke left the team in  he joined the italian team fassa bortolo under giancarlo ferretti he asked not to be paid unless he won he had a largely empty season and was fired he joined mr bookmaker for  he missed so many races that the team director hilaire van der schueren demanded vandenbroucke demonstrate that he was still a racing cyclist he was sacked for not staying in touch in  he signed with mitsubishi where he was suspended when accused by belgian police of buying cocaine in wielsbeke on april  citation needed he won a stage in the french race la boucle de l’artois on a  km time trial his first win in a ucirace since  vandenbroucke said in  ive never done anything to make myself popular in fact the opposite sometimes i think its all a dream ive thrown up a marriage ive been on bad terms with my parents for a long time all of which has troubled and exhausted me he said he had disappointed sponsors managers and directeurs sportifs even though they continued to show confidence in him i had become schizophrenic he said without psychiatric help he would have followed the same path as pantani the italian rider found dead on a hotel floor after  french francs a month at cofidis he earned  at lampre in  and then half that at fasso bortolo family problemsedit vandenbroucke had a daughter cameron with his partner clotilde menu in february  but the couple never were married and soon separated the following year vandenbroucke wed sarah pinacci a former model and hostess with the italian team saecon  they lived at lebbeke near brussels vandenbroucke and pinacci had a turbulent relationship and it was said in the media that they could not live together and they could not live apart  forming what those close to them called a diabolical couple in december  they had a daughter margaux in july  vdb fired a gun into the air while arguing with his wife who later left him vandenbrouckes father jeanjacques said his son had tried to frighten his wife that he had committed suicide his father said frank was talking to sarah on the telephone they were arguing he went out into the garden and let his shotgun off into the air she was frightened that something had happened to him and called the emergency services he did it to try to make her scared it was the fifth or sixth time that she had returned to italy when they are together they fight when they are apart they cry he cant bear it when she leaves he blames himself and takes all the guilt and then there is his daughter he cant bear not being able to see her i probably shouldnt say so but since verona when he met sarah he has not been a committed rider vandenbroucke and pinacci eventually divorced and the belgian struggled to establish a more tranquil lesspublic life he resided for a time with a couple in eeklo who had taken him in after earlier rows with his wife before movingon to stay with other friends his parents who run a bar and his supporters clubn  in ploegsteert  membership dropped from  to  between  and  although  bought franky is for ever tshirts  said in  that they had heard little from their son since he left belgium for italy his wife had visited twice to present her husbands new clothing collection but not to see vandenbroucke in  he and his estranged wife and their daughter had a weekend at eurodisney in paris supporters in the frankyboys fan club at the café t parkske in oudenaarde said vandenbroucke had never been to see them although he said a couple of times that he would come but then never did the chairman of the frankyboys adelin de meulemeester said you can see him one day and hell give you a friendly hello then the next he wont even notice you ziet hij je niet staan in  he asked his agent to ask his parents to sell his house in nieuwekerke near ypresn  vandenbroucke and his uncle jeanluc did not speak for two years after vandenbroucke broke his contract in leaving lotto the team which jeanluc vandenbroucke managed drug problemsedit vandenbroucke made headlines in  for the first of many drug problems arrested by paris police but then released in  he was stopped on the e motorway in belgium in a speeding car shared with bernard sainz the socalled dr mabuse of cycling sainz was jailed in  for falsely practising medicine sainz could not produce the insurance documents the law insisted he carry and police searched the car and found drugs later identified as clenbuterol morphine and epo which is used in sport as a bloodboostern  sainz insisted they were homeopathic products after sainz said he had spent the night at vandenbrouckes house police acquired a search warrant from a court in termonde and searched vandenbrouckes house with drugs specialists there they found small quantities of more drugs which vandenbroucke claimed were for his dog vandenbroucke was handcuffed and taken to a police station two and a half thousand fans signed a petition complaining about his treatment among them was his rival peter van petegem vandenbroucke was banned by the flemish cycling federation from riding in belgium for six months the police said he was very evasive during questioning the inquiries continued and in december  vandenbroucke admitted taking growth hormones epo amphetamine morphine and steroids although he did not name his suppliers he was found guilty in  and sentenced to  hours of community service he appealed and a court in ghent fined him  euros instead the belgian press agency belga said the court considered a fine suited to the type of crime and vandenbrouckes personality vandenbroucke said he was naive but not dishonest in using sainz  who was not charged  but that he was impressed at his results he said at a news conference in ploegsteert that he had always thought sainz gave him homeopathic products but that he had doubts he said sainz had given him drops and injections he said “ he sainz said to me that they were completely legal homeopathic products i wanted to trust him  i was under the charm of dr mabuse i may be considered naive but i am not a dishonest person i want to believe that mr sainz only gave homeopathic care i trusted him bernard sainz proposed that he advise me he seemed to be a strange man but was clearly a cycling expert he impressed me greatly by showing me photographs of him administering his treatments to greats like eddy merckx lucien van impe bernard hinault laurent fignon cyril guimard and many other great sportsmen like alain prostn  he explained to me that this care was based on natural methods and alternative medicines without endangering my health nor violating the ethics of our sport ” he paid sainz  french francs for the homeopathic drops and  in fees in the first half of  sainz said i have concerned myself with him since autumn  not as has been claimed to get him doping products everybody knows perfectly starting with the policemen who have listened to me for a long time that riders dont need me for that sort of thing to the contrary if they turn to me its because theyve heard of what i have been able to do mes compétences diverses for the great stars i have cited vandenbroucke was twice stopped by police in  for driving his porsche after drinking in february  publicity for vandenbrouckes autobiography je ne suis pas dieu im not god said he admitted taking performanceenhancing drugs “ everybody did it used dope and so did i he was quoted it is the truth and it does not diminish the value of my victories ” the publisher later denied vandenbroucke had said it claiming a misunderstanding vandenbroucke did however write that he lived a life of drugtaking and sometimes didnt sleep for days he said “ to stilnoct and amphetamines i added valium sometimes i didnt sleep a second in five days i started seeing things people who didnt exist like people hiding around me in the bushes with telephoto lenses i used to hear them coming with their combatshoes they got out of their bus parked in front of the house they were coming to arrest me shit my dope i ran to the bathroom to throw my stock of amphetamines down the toilet and the syringes into the waste bin sarah didnt used to see them and tried to get me to understand but how couldnt she see them those policemen dozens of them and their flashing lights she must be crazy but was she making it up could she see them really ” in march the union cycliste internationale declared vandenbroucke persona non grata his exwife described him as a cocaine addict vandenbroucke was suspended by mitsubishijartazi and then left impersonationedit in august  vandenbroucke was caught in an italian amateur race at inverno run by an organisation not associated with the italian federation or olympic committee using a licence made out to francesco del ponten  and bearing a photo of the world champion tom boonen he described himself as swiss and living in rome giving the address of a beauty salon vandenbroucke said riding had been a weakness he said i dropped out of the race i have never crossed the line in amateur races and i have never wanted to falsify their races he rode because he needed races he said at a time when he felt strong he denied sticking boonens picture on his licence saying he would have chosen someone elses picture suicide attemptedit vandenbroucke had a reputation for accidents illnesses doping allegations lawsuits suspicion surliness and suspensions he said “ from august  to august   months that seemed like  i was depressed like never before i decided to be finished with it that day i was going to die i went to fetch the most expensive bottle of wine from my cellar a magnum château petrus  i poured it out and i drank a toast to my life id asked the advice of a doctor insulin would do it i wrote a farewell letter it knew it was clumsy lâche but for me it was the best solution theres no need for an autopsy i injected cc of actrapid please dont let them open my eyes  i was alone i put on my world champions jersey i injected myself and then i went to lie on my bed and i waited to die i was so happy no more worries at last deliverance at last it was my mother who found me later that day ” on  june  he was admitted to hospital at magenta near milan italy where he lived he was reported in grave condition his teammanager palmiro masciarelli said frank is all alone est actuellement abandonné he no longer has his wife and he lives by himself there is no longer a team at his side vandenbroucke had turned down the giro ditalia claiming problems with his knee on which he had an operation the previous winter his psychiatrist jef brouwers said  the problems with his knee have affected him badly he could no longer ride as he wanted after the operation nor could the doctors say what the problem was these last few days he has been terrible the people that i called in italy could no longer help him he had thought it through and so far as he was concerned everything was lost the situation of his knee has worn him down completely la entièrement dévoré and his private life wasnt good either with ups and downs deathedit vandenbroucke died on  october  while on holiday at saly a coastal resort  km south of dakar the capital of

procycling as having a whole range of bedrooms different garages for his bikes and his cars spacious living rooms an indoor swimming pool and backs on to the pond dug so that he could indulge his passion for fishing  the french journalist florent joyard said supporters in the bar which vandenbrouckes parents keep at ploegsteert were puzzled by what had been found one was quoted as saying clenbuterol leaves traces for a month so youd have to be really an idiot to take it its impossible and what else did they find an ampoule of eprex epo but epo stays detectable for eight days and frank

his company  del ponte is a rough translation of vandenbroucke in italian van den means of the or from the in prereform spelling there is no dutch word broucke but the pronunciation sounds like the word for bridge or bridges it also sounds like the word for trousers leading to comments that his name could also have been translated as del pantalone that was the version that vandenbroucke told reporters from gazzetta dello sport would have been the more appropriate translation broucke means trousers in dutch he said etymology broucke refers to brouc the medieval dutch word for wetlands

but a remarkable talent which appeared in his adolescence in athletics and then in cycle racing dissipated in a succession of drugs problems rows with teams suicide attempts and finally being disowned by the cycling world his former wife described him as a cocaine addict he is known to have had numerous drug and family problems and to have attempted suicidecitation needed however vdb claimed in an

the frenchspeaking region of belgium with facilities for dutch speakers in  when he was four and cycling in the village square he was knocked over by the driver of a rally car his mother said her son didnt cry until doctors cut his cycling shorts the collision led to four operations on his right knee and repeated problems later in life vandenbroucke first tried athletics joining the entente athlétique hainaut in  he became a regional schoolboy championn  he took out a cycling licence with the club in  and won a race at brakel an unnamed acquaintance told the belgian journalist philippe van holle it must have been when i was about  or  and went out training with a friend on the belgian borders as we spun along out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel he looked about  he was still there  minutes later so we picked up speed he just sat there so we picked up the pace again it was still no problem for him i looked over my shoulder and he gave me a halfmocking halffriendly grin in the end we went as hard as we could to try to get rid of him and teach the little brat a lesson because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes but whatever we did he still hung on after about an hour we came into a village called ploegsteert at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said ok im back home now so bye by the way im frank vandenbroucke neither of us had ever met a kid like him in  when he was  vandenbroucke won the national beginners débutant road championship at halanzy he came third in the world junior road championship in athens in  careeredit vandenbroucke turned professional in  with the belgian team lotto the directeur sportif was his uncle jeanluc he won  races in the next six years including liège–bastogne–liège in  from

of johan museeuw the manager was patrick lefevère vandenbroucke stayed there until the end of  the year in which he won gent–wevelgem two stages and the overall competition of paris–nice and two stages of the tour de wallonie in  he transferred to the french team cofidis the british magazine procycling said three years on a contract worth  million belgian francs £ was a deal beyond vdbs wildest dreams he never suspected that having all that money in his pocket would set off a terrible downward spiral he won het volk and liège–bastogne–liège before sinking into a doping controversy that was never satisfactorily explained see below  even though vdb was cleared by the courts the team suspended him while the allegations were investigated and relations with their star rider never recovered when he came back he showed well in the  vuelta before remarkably managing to finish in the front group of the world championship despite fracturing both hands en route contractually obliged to stay with cofidis vdb had a poor  season by this point people in cycling were talking more about vdbs nights out than his riding at cofidis he shared leadership with david millar his noncommunication with millar was publicised and criticised it was with cofidis vandenbroucke said in his autobiography that he met the french rider philippe gaumont it was gaumonts confessions of drugtaking in the team that led to the socalled cofidis scandal that included a raid by drugs police on millars house and the british riders suspension for two years and his disqualification from the world timetrial championship he had won gaumont vandenbroucke said in his life story suggested he take a drug trip by mixing stilnoct a sleeping aid with alcohol gaumont described vandenbroucke as a wild man of cycling it was gaumont vandenbroucke said who introduced him to bernard sainz with whom his name would be connected in alleged drugs scandals see below that year was vandenbrouckes best he won liège–bastogne–liège omloop het volk and stages in paris–nice and the vuelta a españa his win in liège–bastogne–liège was so dominant that some called him a genius of cycling because he said on television where he would attack it was however his last year of major victories in  he moved to the italian team lampre then to the belgian team domofarm frites the following year rejoining lefevère and museeuw vandenbroucke stayed with lefevère when he started the quick stepdavitamon team in  and he came second to peter van petegem in the tour of flanders vandenbroucke said he was happy with his performance that he had attacked van petegem on the last climbs because he knew van petegem would beat him in the sprint but lefevère criticised him for lack of effort and vandenbroucke left the team in  he joined the italian team fassa bortolo under giancarlo ferretti he asked not to be paid unless he won he had a largely empty season and was fired he joined mr bookmaker for  he missed so many races that the team director hilaire van der schueren demanded vandenbroucke demonstrate that he was still a racing cyclist he was sacked for not staying in touch in  he signed with mitsubishi where he was suspended when accused by belgian police of buying cocaine in wielsbeke on april  citation needed he won a stage in the french race la boucle de l’artois on a  km time trial his first win in a ucirace since  vandenbroucke said in  ive never done anything to make myself popular in fact the opposite sometimes i think its all a dream ive thrown up a marriage ive been on bad terms with my parents for a long time all of which has troubled and exhausted me he said he had disappointed sponsors managers and directeurs sportifs even though they continued to show confidence in him i had become schizophrenic he said without psychiatric help he would have followed the same path as pantani the italian rider found dead on a hotel floor after  french francs a month at cofidis he earned  at lampre in  and then half that at fasso bortolo family problemsedit vandenbroucke had a daughter cameron with his partner clotilde menu in february  but the couple never were married and soon separated the following year vandenbroucke wed sarah pinacci a former model and hostess with the italian team saecon  they lived at lebbeke near brussels vandenbroucke and pinacci had a turbulent relationship and it was said in the media that they could not live together and they could not live apart  forming what those close to them called a diabolical couple in december  they had a daughter margaux in july  vdb fired a gun into the air while arguing with his wife who later left him vandenbrouckes father jeanjacques said his son had tried to frighten his wife that he had committed suicide his father said frank was talking to sarah on the telephone they were arguing he went out into the garden and let his shotgun off into the air she was frightened that something had happened to him and called the emergency services he did it to try to make her scared it was the fifth or sixth time that she had returned to italy when they are together they fight when they are apart they cry he cant bear it when she leaves he blames himself and takes all the guilt and then there is his daughter he cant bear not being able to see her i probably shouldnt say so but since verona when he met sarah he has not been a committed rider vandenbroucke and pinacci eventually divorced and the belgian struggled to establish a more tranquil lesspublic life he resided for a time with a couple in eeklo who had taken him in after earlier rows with his wife before movingon to stay with other friends his parents who run a bar and his supporters clubn  in ploegsteert  membership dropped from  to  between  and  although  bought franky is for ever tshirts  said in  that they had heard little from their son since he left belgium for italy his wife had visited twice to present her husbands new clothing collection but not to see vandenbroucke in  he and his estranged wife and their daughter had a weekend at eurodisney in paris supporters in the frankyboys fan club at the café t parkske in oudenaarde said vandenbroucke had never been to see them although he said a couple of times that he would come but then never did the chairman of the frankyboys adelin de meulemeester said you can see him one day and hell give you a friendly hello then the next he wont even notice you ziet hij je niet staan in  he asked his agent to ask his parents to sell his house in nieuwekerke near ypresn  vandenbroucke and his uncle jeanluc did not speak for two years after vandenbroucke broke his contract in leaving lotto the team which jeanluc vandenbroucke managed drug problemsedit vandenbroucke made headlines in  for the first of many drug problems arrested by paris police but then released in  he was stopped on the e motorway in belgium in a speeding car shared with bernard sainz the socalled dr mabuse of cycling sainz was jailed in  for falsely practising medicine sainz could not produce the insurance documents the law insisted he carry and police searched the car and found drugs later identified as clenbuterol morphine and epo which is used in sport as a bloodboostern  sainz insisted they were homeopathic products after sainz said he had spent the night at vandenbrouckes house police acquired a search warrant from a court in termonde and searched vandenbrouckes house with drugs specialists there they found small quantities of more drugs which vandenbroucke claimed were for his dog vandenbroucke was handcuffed and taken to a police station two and a half thousand fans signed a petition complaining about his treatment among them was his rival peter van petegem vandenbroucke was banned by the flemish cycling federation from riding in belgium for six months the police said he was very evasive during questioning the inquiries continued and in december  vandenbroucke admitted taking growth hormones epo amphetamine morphine and steroids although he did not name his suppliers he was found guilty in  and sentenced to  hours of community service he appealed and a court in ghent fined him  euros instead the belgian press agency belga said the court considered a fine suited to the type of crime and vandenbrouckes personality vandenbroucke said he was naive but not dishonest in using sainz  who was not charged  but that he was impressed at his results he said at a news conference in ploegsteert that he had always thought sainz gave him homeopathic products but that he had doubts he said sainz had given him drops and injections he said “ he sainz said to me that they were completely legal homeopathic products i wanted to trust him  i was under the charm of dr mabuse i may be considered naive but i am not a dishonest person i want to believe that mr sainz only gave homeopathic care i trusted him bernard sainz proposed that he advise me he seemed to be a strange man but was clearly a cycling expert he impressed me greatly by showing me photographs of him administering his treatments to greats like eddy merckx lucien van impe bernard hinault laurent fignon cyril guimard and many other great sportsmen like alain prostn  he explained to me that this care was based on natural methods and alternative medicines without endangering my health nor violating the ethics of our sport ” he paid sainz  french francs for the homeopathic drops and  in fees in the first half of  sainz said i have concerned myself with him since autumn  not as has been claimed to get him doping products everybody knows perfectly starting with the policemen who have listened to me for a long time that riders dont need me for that sort of thing to the contrary if they turn to me its because theyve heard of what i have been able to do mes compétences diverses for the great stars i have cited vandenbroucke was twice stopped by police in  for driving his porsche after drinking in february  publicity for vandenbrouckes autobiography je ne suis pas dieu im not god said he admitted taking performanceenhancing drugs “ everybody did it used dope and so did i he was quoted it is the truth and it does not diminish the value of my victories ” the publisher later denied vandenbroucke had said it claiming a misunderstanding vandenbroucke did however write that he lived a life of drugtaking and sometimes didnt sleep for days he said “ to stilnoct and amphetamines i added valium sometimes i didnt sleep a second in five days i started seeing things people who didnt exist like people hiding around me in the bushes with telephoto lenses i used to hear them coming with their combatshoes they got out of their bus parked in front of the house they were coming to arrest me shit my dope i ran to the bathroom to throw my stock of amphetamines down the toilet and the syringes into the waste bin sarah didnt used to see them and tried to get me to understand but how couldnt she see them those policemen dozens of them and their flashing lights she must be crazy but was she making it up could she see them really ” in march the union cycliste

 he was still there  minutes later so we picked up speed he just sat there so we picked up the pace again it was still no problem for him i looked over my shoulder and he gave me a halfmocking halffriendly grin in the end we went as hard as we could to try to get rid of him and teach the little brat a lesson because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes but whatever we did he still hung on after about an hour we came into a village called ploegsteert at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said ok im back home now so bye by the way im frank vandenbroucke

was naive but not dishonest in using sainz  who was not charged  but that he was impressed at his results he said at a news conference in ploegsteert that he had always thought sainz gave him homeopathic products but that he had doubts he said sainz had given him drops and injections he said “ he sainz said to me that they were completely legal homeopathic products i wanted to trust him  i was under the charm of dr mabuse i may be considered naive but i am not a dishonest person i want to believe that mr sainz only gave homeopathic care i trusted him bernard sainz proposed that he advise me he seemed to be a strange man but was clearly a cycling expert he impressed me greatly by showing me photographs of him administering his treatments to greats like eddy merckx lucien van impe bernard hinault laurent fignon cyril guimard and many other great sportsmen like alain prostn  he explained to me that this care was based on natural methods and alternative medicines without endangering my health nor violating the ethics of our sport ” he paid sainz  french francs for the homeopathic drops and  in fees in the first half of  sainz said i have concerned myself with him since autumn  not as has been claimed to get him doping products everybody knows perfectly starting with the policemen who have listened to me for a long time that riders dont need me for that sort of thing to the contrary if they turn to me its because theyve heard of what i have been able to do mes compétences diverses for the great stars i have cited vandenbroucke was twice stopped by police in

however write that he lived a life of drugtaking and sometimes didnt sleep for days he said “ to stilnoct and amphetamines i added valium sometimes i didnt sleep a second in five days i started seeing things people who didnt exist like people hiding around me in the bushes with telephoto lenses i used to hear them coming with their combatshoes they got out of their bus parked in front of the house they were coming to arrest me shit my dope i ran to the bathroom to throw my stock of amphetamines down the toilet and the syringes into the waste bin sarah didnt used to see them and tried to get me

but a remarkable talent which appeared in his adolescence in athletics and then in cycle racing dissipated in a succession of drugs problems rows with teams suicide attempts and finally being disowned by the cycling world his former wife described him as a cocaine addict he is known to have had numerous drug and family problems and to have attempted suicidecitation needed however vdb claimed in an interview with procyclings daniel friebe three weeks before his death to have made a nearcomplete recovery from the emotional issues that plagued him throughout his career vandenbroucke told friebe i

the frenchspeaking region of belgium with facilities for dutch speakers in  when he was four and cycling in the village square he was knocked over by the driver of a rally car his mother said her son

athlétique hainaut in  he became a regional schoolboy championn  he took out a cycling licence with the club in  and won a race at brakel an unnamed acquaintance told the belgian journalist philippe van holle it must have been when i was about  or  and went out training with a friend on the belgian borders as we spun along out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel he looked about  he was still there  minutes later so we picked up speed he just sat there so we picked up the pace again it was still no problem for him i looked over my shoulder and he gave me a halfmocking halffriendly grin in the end we went as hard as we could to try to get rid of him and teach the little brat a lesson because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes but whatever we did he still hung on after about an hour we came into a village called ploegsteert at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said ok im back home now so bye by the way im frank vandenbroucke neither of us had ever met a kid like him in  when he was  vandenbroucke won the national beginners débutant road championship at halanzy he came third in the world junior road championship in athens

stages of the tour de wallonie in  he transferred to the french team cofidis the british magazine procycling said three years on a contract worth  million belgian francs £ was a deal beyond vdbs

that was never satisfactorily explained see below  even though vdb was cleared by the courts the team suspended him while the allegations were investigated and relations with their star rider never recovered when he came back he showed well in the  vuelta before remarkably managing to finish in the front group of the world championship despite fracturing both hands en route contractually obliged

noncommunication with millar was publicised and criticised it was with cofidis vandenbroucke said in his autobiography that he met the french rider philippe gaumont it was gaumonts confessions of drugtaking in the team that led to the socalled cofidis scandal that included a raid by drugs police on millars house and the british riders suspension for two years and his disqualification from the world timetrial championship he had won gaumont vandenbroucke said in his life story suggested he take a drug trip by mixing stilnoct a sleeping aid with alcohol gaumont described vandenbroucke as a

but a remarkable talent which appeared in his adolescence in athletics and then in cycle racing dissipated in a succession of drugs problems rows with teams suicide attempts and finally being disowned by the cycling world his former wife described him as a cocaine addict he is known to have had numerous drug and family problems and to have attempted suicidecitation needed however vdb claimed in an interview with procyclings daniel friebe three weeks before his death to have made a nearcomplete recovery from the emotional issues that plagued him throughout his career vandenbroucke told friebe i simply realise that the last year and a half have been fantastic for me nevertheless he died of a pulmonary embolism in october  contents  background  career  family problems  drug problems  impersonation  suicide attempt  death  selected victories  see also  notes  references  external links backgroundedit frank vandenbroucke was born in mouscron and grew up in ploegsteert a village in the frenchspeaking region of belgium with facilities for dutch speakers in  when he was four and cycling in the village square he was knocked over by the driver of a rally car his mother said her son didnt cry until doctors cut his cycling shorts the collision led to four operations on his right knee and repeated problems later in life vandenbroucke first tried athletics joining the entente athlétique hainaut in  he became a regional schoolboy championn  he took out a cycling licence with the club in  and won a race at brakel an unnamed acquaintance told the belgian journalist philippe van holle it must have been when i was about  or  and went out training with a friend on the belgian borders as we spun along out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel he looked about  he was still there  minutes later so we picked up speed he just sat there so we picked up the pace again it was still no problem for him i looked over my shoulder and he gave me a halfmocking halffriendly grin in the end we went as hard as we could to try to get rid of him and teach the little brat a lesson because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes but whatever we did he still hung on after about an hour we came into a village called ploegsteert at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said ok im back home now so bye by the way im frank vandenbroucke neither of us had ever met a kid like him in  when he was  vandenbroucke won the national beginners débutant road championship at halanzy he came third in the world junior road championship in athens in  careeredit vandenbroucke turned professional in  with the belgian team lotto the directeur sportif was his uncle jeanluc he won  races in the next six years including liège–bastogne–liège in  from  he made the sports pages more for doping problems failed comebacks depression marital problems and a failed suicide vandenbroucke left lotto in the middle of  to join mapei there he became a teammate of johan museeuw the manager was patrick lefevère vandenbroucke stayed there until the end of  the year in which he won gent–wevelgem two stages and the overall competition of paris–nice and two stages of the tour de wallonie in  he transferred to the french team cofidis the british magazine procycling said three years on a contract worth  million belgian francs £ was a deal beyond vdbs wildest dreams he never suspected that having all that money in his pocket would set off a terrible downward spiral he won het volk and liège–bastogne–liège before sinking into a doping controversy that was never satisfactorily explained see below  even though vdb was cleared by the courts the team suspended him while the allegations were investigated and relations with their star rider never recovered when he came back he showed well in the  vuelta before remarkably managing to finish in the front group of the world championship despite fracturing both hands en route contractually obliged to stay with cofidis vdb had a poor  season by this point people in cycling were talking more about vdbs nights out than his riding at cofidis he shared leadership with david millar his noncommunication with millar was publicised and criticised it was with cofidis vandenbroucke said in his autobiography that he met the french rider philippe gaumont it was gaumonts confessions of drugtaking in the team that led to the socalled cofidis scandal that included a raid by drugs police on millars house and the british riders suspension for two years and his disqualification from the world timetrial championship he had won gaumont vandenbroucke said in his life story suggested he take a drug trip by mixing stilnoct a sleeping aid with alcohol gaumont described vandenbroucke as a wild man of cycling it was gaumont vandenbroucke said who introduced him to bernard sainz with whom his name would be connected in alleged drugs scandals see below that year was vandenbrouckes best he won liège–bastogne–liège omloop het volk and stages in paris–nice and the vuelta a españa his win in liège–bastogne–liège was so dominant that some called him a genius of cycling because he said on television where he would attack it was however his last year of major victories in  he moved to the italian team lampre then to the belgian team domofarm frites the following year rejoining lefevère and museeuw vandenbroucke stayed with lefevère when he started the quick stepdavitamon team in  and he came second to peter van petegem in the tour of flanders vandenbroucke said he was happy with his performance that he had attacked van petegem on the last climbs because he knew van petegem would beat him in the sprint but lefevère criticised him for lack of effort and vandenbroucke left the team in  he joined the italian team fassa bortolo under giancarlo ferretti he asked not to be paid unless he won he had a largely empty season and was fired he joined mr bookmaker for  he missed so many races that the team director hilaire van der schueren demanded vandenbroucke demonstrate that he was still a racing cyclist he was sacked for not staying in touch in  he signed with mitsubishi where he was suspended when accused by belgian police of buying cocaine in wielsbeke on april  citation needed he won a stage in the french race la boucle de l’artois on a  km time trial his first win in a ucirace since  vandenbroucke said in  ive never done anything to make myself popular in fact the opposite sometimes i think its all a dream ive thrown up a marriage ive been on bad terms with my parents for a long time all of which has troubled and exhausted me he said he had disappointed sponsors managers and directeurs sportifs even though they continued to show confidence in him i had become schizophrenic he said without psychiatric help he would have followed the same path as pantani the italian rider found dead on a hotel floor after  french francs a month at cofidis he earned

relationship and it was said in the media that they could not live together and they could not live apart  forming what those close to them called a diabolical couple in december  they had a daughter margaux in july  vdb fired a gun into the air while arguing with his wife who later left him vandenbrouckes father jeanjacques said his son had tried to frighten his wife that he had committed suicide his father said frank was talking to sarah on the telephone they were arguing he went out into the garden and let his shotgun off into the air she was frightened that something had happened to him and called the emergency services he did it to try to make her scared it was the fifth or sixth time that she had returned to italy when they are together they fight when they are apart they cry he cant bear it when she leaves he blames himself and takes all the guilt and then there is his daughter he cant bear not being able to see her i probably shouldnt say so but since verona when he met sarah he has not been a committed rider vandenbroucke and pinacci eventually divorced and the belgian struggled to establish a more tranquil lesspublic life he resided for a time with a couple in eeklo who had

but a remarkable talent which appeared in his adolescence in athletics and then in cycle racing dissipated in a succession of drugs problems rows with teams suicide attempts and finally being disowned by the cycling world his former wife described him as a cocaine addict he is known to have had numerous drug and family problems and to have attempted suicidecitation needed however vdb claimed in an interview with procyclings daniel friebe three weeks before his death to have made a nearcomplete recovery from the emotional issues that plagued him throughout his career vandenbroucke told friebe i simply realise that the last year and a half have been fantastic for me nevertheless he died of a pulmonary embolism in october  contents  background  career  family problems  drug problems  impersonation  suicide attempt  death  selected victories  see also  notes  references  external links backgroundedit frank vandenbroucke was born in mouscron and grew up in ploegsteert a village in the frenchspeaking region of belgium with facilities for dutch speakers in  when he was four and cycling in the village square he was knocked over by the driver of a rally car his mother said her son didnt cry until doctors cut his cycling shorts the collision led to four operations on his right knee and repeated problems later in life vandenbroucke first tried athletics joining the entente athlétique hainaut in  he became a regional schoolboy championn  he took out a cycling licence with the club in  and won a race at brakel an unnamed acquaintance told the belgian journalist philippe van holle it must have been when i was about  or  and went out training with a friend on the belgian borders as we spun along out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel he looked about  he was still there  minutes later so we picked up speed he just sat there so we picked up the pace again it was still no problem for him i looked over my shoulder and he gave me a halfmocking halffriendly grin in the end we went as hard as we could to try to get rid of him and teach the little brat a lesson because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes but whatever we did he still hung on after about an hour we came into a village called ploegsteert at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said ok im back home now so bye by the way im frank vandenbroucke neither of us had ever met a kid like him in  when he was  vandenbroucke won the national beginners débutant road championship at halanzy he came third in the world junior road championship in athens in  careeredit vandenbroucke turned professional in  with the belgian team lotto the directeur sportif was his uncle jeanluc he won  races in the next six years including liège–bastogne–liège in  from  he made the sports pages more for doping problems failed comebacks depression marital problems and a failed suicide vandenbroucke left lotto in the middle of  to join mapei there he became a teammate of johan museeuw the manager was patrick lefevère vandenbroucke stayed there until the end of  the year in which he won gent–wevelgem two stages and the overall competition of paris–nice and two stages of the tour de wallonie in  he transferred to the french team cofidis the british magazine procycling said three years on a contract worth  million belgian francs £ was a deal beyond vdbs wildest dreams he never suspected that having all that money in his pocket would set off a terrible downward spiral he won het volk and liège–bastogne–liège before sinking into a doping controversy that was never satisfactorily explained see below  even though vdb was cleared by the courts the team suspended him while the allegations were investigated and relations with their star rider never recovered when he came back he showed well in the  vuelta before remarkably managing to finish in the front group of the world championship despite fracturing both hands en route contractually obliged to stay with cofidis vdb had a poor  season by this point people in cycling were talking more about vdbs nights out than his riding at cofidis he shared leadership with david millar his noncommunication with millar was publicised and criticised it was with cofidis vandenbroucke said in his autobiography that he met the french rider philippe gaumont it was gaumonts confessions of drugtaking in the team that led to the socalled cofidis scandal that included a raid by drugs police on millars house and the british riders suspension for two years and his disqualification from the world timetrial championship he had won gaumont vandenbroucke said in his life story suggested he take a drug trip by mixing stilnoct a sleeping aid with alcohol gaumont described vandenbroucke as a wild man of cycling it was gaumont vandenbroucke said who introduced him to bernard sainz with whom his name would be connected in alleged drugs scandals see below that year was vandenbrouckes best he won liège–bastogne–liège omloop het volk and stages in paris–nice and the vuelta a españa his win in liège–bastogne–liège was so dominant that some called him a genius of cycling because he said on television where he would attack it was however his last year of major victories in  he moved to the italian team lampre then to the belgian team domofarm frites the following year rejoining lefevère and museeuw vandenbroucke stayed with lefevère when he started the quick stepdavitamon team in  and he came second to peter van petegem in the tour of flanders vandenbroucke said he was happy with his performance that he had attacked van petegem on the last climbs because he knew van petegem would beat him in the sprint but lefevère criticised him for lack of effort and vandenbroucke left the team in  he joined the italian team fassa bortolo under giancarlo ferretti he asked not to be paid unless he won he had a largely empty season and was fired he joined mr bookmaker for  he missed so many races that the team director hilaire van der schueren demanded vandenbroucke demonstrate that he was still a racing cyclist he was sacked for not staying in touch in  he signed with mitsubishi where he was suspended when accused by belgian police of buying cocaine in wielsbeke on april  citation needed he won a stage in the french race la boucle de l’artois on a  km time trial his first win in a ucirace since  vandenbroucke said in  ive never done anything to make myself popular in fact the opposite sometimes i think its all a dream ive thrown up a marriage ive been on bad terms with my parents for a long time all of which has troubled and exhausted me he said he had disappointed sponsors managers and directeurs sportifs even though they continued to show confidence in him i had become schizophrenic he said without psychiatric help he would have followed the same path as pantani the italian rider found dead on a hotel floor after  french francs a month at cofidis he earned  at lampre in  and then half that at fasso bortolo family problemsedit vandenbroucke had a daughter cameron with his partner clotilde menu in february  but the couple never were married and soon separated the following year vandenbroucke wed sarah pinacci a former model and hostess with the italian team saecon  they lived at lebbeke near brussels vandenbroucke and pinacci had a turbulent relationship and it was said in the media that they could not live together and they could not live apart  forming what those close to them called a diabolical couple in december  they had a daughter margaux in july  vdb fired a gun into the air while arguing with his wife who later left him vandenbrouckes father jeanjacques said his son had tried to frighten his wife that he had committed suicide his father said frank was talking to sarah on the telephone they were arguing he went out into the garden and let his shotgun off into the air she was frightened that something had happened to him and called the emergency services he did it to try to make her scared it was the fifth or sixth time that she had returned to italy when they are together they fight when they are apart they cry he cant bear it when she leaves he blames himself and takes all the guilt and then there is his daughter he cant bear not being able to see her i probably shouldnt say so but since verona when he met sarah he has not been a committed rider vandenbroucke and pinacci eventually divorced and the belgian struggled to establish a more tranquil lesspublic life he resided for a time with a couple in eeklo who had taken him in after earlier rows with his wife before movingon to stay with other friends his parents who run a bar and his supporters clubn  in ploegsteert  membership dropped from  to  between  and  although  bought franky is for ever tshirts  said in  that they had heard little from their son since he left belgium for italy his wife had visited twice to present her husbands new clothing collection but not to see vandenbroucke in  he and his estranged wife and their daughter had a weekend at eurodisney in paris supporters in the frankyboys fan club at the café t parkske in oudenaarde said vandenbroucke had never been to see them although he said a couple of times that he would come but then never did the chairman of the frankyboys adelin de meulemeester said you can see him one day and hell give you a friendly hello then the next he wont even notice you ziet hij je niet staan in  he asked his agent to ask his parents to sell his house in nieuwekerke near ypresn  vandenbroucke and his uncle jeanluc did not speak for two years after vandenbroucke broke his contract in leaving lotto the team which jeanluc vandenbroucke managed drug problemsedit vandenbroucke made headlines in  for the first of many drug problems arrested by paris police but then released in  he was stopped on the e motorway in belgium in a speeding car shared with bernard sainz the socalled dr mabuse of cycling sainz was jailed in  for falsely practising medicine sainz could not produce the insurance documents the law insisted he carry and police searched the car and found drugs later identified as clenbuterol morphine and epo which is used in sport as a bloodboostern  sainz insisted they were homeopathic products after sainz said he had spent the night at vandenbrouckes house police acquired a search warrant from a court in termonde and searched vandenbrouckes house with drugs specialists there they found small quantities of more drugs which vandenbroucke claimed were for his dog vandenbroucke was handcuffed and taken to a police station two and a half thousand fans signed a petition complaining about his treatment among them was his rival peter van petegem vandenbroucke was banned by the flemish cycling federation from riding in belgium for six months the police said he was very evasive during questioning the inquiries continued and in december  vandenbroucke admitted taking growth hormones epo amphetamine morphine and steroids although he did not name his suppliers he was found guilty in  and sentenced to  hours of community service he appealed and a court in ghent fined him  euros instead the belgian press agency belga said the court considered a fine suited to the type of crime and vandenbrouckes personality vandenbroucke said he was naive but not dishonest in using sainz  who was not charged  but that he was impressed at his results he said at a news conference in ploegsteert that he had always thought sainz gave him homeopathic products but that he had doubts he said sainz had given him drops and injections he said “ he sainz said to me that they were completely legal homeopathic products i wanted to trust him  i was under the charm of dr mabuse i may be considered naive but i am not a dishonest person i want to believe that mr sainz only gave homeopathic care i trusted him bernard sainz proposed that he advise me he seemed to be a strange man but was clearly a cycling expert he impressed me greatly by showing me photographs of him administering his treatments to greats like eddy merckx lucien van impe bernard hinault laurent fignon cyril guimard and many other great sportsmen like alain prostn  he explained to me that this care was based on natural methods and alternative medicines without endangering my health nor violating the ethics of our sport ” he paid sainz  french francs for the homeopathic drops and  in fees in the first half of  sainz said i have concerned myself with him since autumn  not as has been claimed to get him doping products everybody knows perfectly starting with the policemen who have listened to me for a long time that riders dont need me for that sort of thing to the contrary if they turn to me its because theyve heard of what i have been able to do mes compétences diverses for the great stars i have cited vandenbroucke was twice stopped by police in  for driving his porsche after drinking in february  publicity for vandenbrouckes autobiography je ne suis pas dieu im not god said he admitted taking performanceenhancing drugs “ everybody did it used dope and so did i he was quoted it is the truth and it does not diminish the value of my victories ” the publisher later denied vandenbroucke had said it claiming a misunderstanding vandenbroucke did however write that he lived a life of drugtaking and sometimes didnt sleep for days he said “ to stilnoct and amphetamines i added valium sometimes i didnt sleep a second in five days i started seeing things people who didnt exist like people hiding around me in the bushes with telephoto lenses i used to hear them coming with their combatshoes they got out of their bus parked in front of the house they were coming to arrest me shit my dope i ran to the bathroom to throw my stock of amphetamines down the toilet and the syringes into the waste bin sarah didnt used to see them and tried to get me to understand but how couldnt she see them those policemen dozens of them and their flashing lights she must be crazy but was she making it up could she see them really ” in march the union cycliste

letter it knew it was clumsy lâche but for me it was the best solution theres no need for an autopsy i injected cc of actrapid please dont let them open my eyes  i was alone i put on my world champions jersey i injected myself and then i went to lie on my bed and i waited to die i was so happy no more worries at last deliverance at last it was my mother who found me later that day ” on
