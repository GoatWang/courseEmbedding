widespread use of synthetic plastics has increased concerns over their adverse environmental impacts and dramatic fluctuations in the cost and availability of petrochemical sources for plastic production creates the need for renewable environmentallyfriendly plastics derived from agricultural sources blow molded products are used widely in packaging and are a major component of the plastics manufacturing industry that are suitable for replacement by biobased materials this project will demonstrate the use of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas a family of bioplastics made by the biological conversion of agricultural feedstocks in commercialscale blow molding manufacturing operations advances in pha formulation and processing technology developed in phase  of the project demonstrated the feasibility of blow molding phas at the labscale in this program pha formulations will be improved with the necessary melt strength and crystallization behavior for blow molding operations using existing equipment at current production fficiencies while providing the key physical properties needed in the blow molded part once satisfactory formulations are developed pilot blow molding trials will be conducted to confirm proper rheological behavior of the pha formulations and physical properties of the molded part metabolix will then demonstrate blow molding on commercial scale equipment

pha resin formulations with processing properties suitable for largescale blow molding operations demonstrate blow molding at commercial scale map the physical properties of the blow molded product and optimize blow molding cycle times to that of commercial production specifications metabolix will use a combination of high molecular weight biobased phas in conjunction with reactive extrusion processes to create blends of branched and linear phas with the required rheological properties and melt strength for blow molding operations on commercial scale equipment these formulations will be further improved in conjunction with blow molding process optimization to achieve commercial line speeds and meet full enduse container physical properties success in this project will open up a large segment of the current thermoplastics market to biobased pha products project methods the following tasks are critical to the successful development of pha resin formulations suitable for blow molding and the production of blow molded products from biobased pha polymers  synthesis and molecular characterization of branched phas  production and characterization of blends of linear and branched phas of varying molecular weights and compositions  conduct labscale blow molding measure and map physical properties of item  conduct commercialscale blow molding measure and map physical properties of item  optimize formulation to meet commercial scale blow molding times results obtained from phase  of the program will form the basis for moving forward with task  and  to develop formulations that have the desired elastic and viscous properties at the preferred processing conditions for phas labscale blow molding operations similar to that conducted in the phase  project will be conducted to demonstrate improved melt strength and required rheological behavior needed for larger scale blow molding operations physical properties of the blow molded object will be measured and mapped as a basis for comparison with a standard pet blow molded object once a formulations is identified that has the required combination of melt strength and physical properties blow molding operations will be conducted on commercialscale blow molding equipment metabolix has worked with several plastics converters with commercial blow molding equipment available for testing these formulations once commercial scale objects have been blow molded the physical properties will be measured and mapped then compared with pet blow molded items to ensure equivalent product characteristics the final task will be to optimize the blow molding formulation to increase blow molding production to that obtained by commercial resins the work proposed in this project will use pha polymer produced by metabolixs microbial fermentation process this material estimated to be approximately  lbs will be provided by the metabolixadm commercial production facility scheduled to begin operation in late progress  to outputsoutputs  bottle wall thickness and weight measurements showed that branched p control sample consistently gave maximum wall thickness and bottle weight while p the minimum all the rest of samples with various weight blending ratios resulted in wall thickness and bottle weight sat between results of these two control samples  under the same mold temperature and blowinjection pressure the differences of wall thickness and weight were narrowed down as extrusion barrel temperature profile was lowered due to reduce melt flow rate  statistical analysis of various blends of pp and pf showed a consistent trend that increasing the nonbranched low melt strength p content reduces bottle wall thickness and weight similar trend was observed with pp blends but to a lesser extent  drop water bottle impact test showed that p has the best impact strength due to its low glass transition temperature lower shear melt viscosity and high melt strength due to branching the negative effect of using standalone p compound for blow molding is the resulted lower bottle rigidity which can be improved through the blending with p or f  the processing window of nonbranched p is inherently narrow due to low melt strength and high melt viscosity and can only produce good quality bottles with uniform wall thickness under higher processing temperature at a loading level of  p helps to improve melt flow and increases impact strength of blow molded p bottles under optimal processing conditions this approach of blending branched and nonbranched pha compounds enables us to control melt rheology of the blended compounds to strike a balance between bottle rigidity and impact strength in the finished bottle products participants nothing significant to report during this reporting period target audiences not relevant to this project project modifications metabolix requested and received a six month no cost extension to map out the process property performance window of the post fabrication annealing step this study will determine best annealing conditions for improved properties and a commercially viable annealing system will be set up to demonstrate performance in addition a processing guide to assist converters with blow mold operations using our pha formulation will be developedimpactswith the assistance from csu and uml in providing extrusion blow molding equipments man power and technical support to conduct detailed experimentation and testing on different pha compounds we were able to successfully produce extrusion blow molded bottle samples with good

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
