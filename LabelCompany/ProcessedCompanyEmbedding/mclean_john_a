cd music product description better angels album for sale by john mclean was released sep   on the origin label guitarist john mcleans better angels is certainly difficult to classify better angels songs some pieces such as ready for the war come across as modern pop others are closer to the music of the pat metheny group while a few tunes are modernized swing standards including one of the strangest versions of airmail special one will ever hear better angels album for sale while there are some individual spots the emphasis during most of the selections is on the haunting ensemble sound which features mcleans regular group plus guest violinist karl montzka and occasionally the mostly wordless voice of grazyna auguscik better angels cd music the intriguing results are worth several
