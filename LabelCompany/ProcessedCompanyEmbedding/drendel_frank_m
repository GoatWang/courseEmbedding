average student at paxton high school going to college and earning a degree wasn’t that important luckily paxton mustangs football coach pat zukowski saw something in the young man zukowski persuaded drendel a standout on the football field to continue his playing days and studies at northern illinois university “he insisted that if nothing else go up and make the team” drendel recalled zukowski’s insistence would change drendel’s life it was while drendel was at niu in dekalb in the mid0s that he found a job in the cable industry which was just in its infancy at the time it was that job — although just a parttime gig to get him through school — that would end up planting the seeds to drendel’s acclaimed career as the chief executive of a fortune  company “only in america it’s just absolutely only in america can a farm boy from paxton illinois come up and build a business that’s a fortune  company” said drendel one of three people who will be inducted into the paxtonbuckleyloda hall of fame’s first induction class this week “life is a series of good luck and i had a bunch of it” drendel a  paxton high school graduate founded commscope in  after graduating from niu he launched the company after acquiring a struggling cable product line called commscope from his thenemployer superior continental drendel started working in the cable television industry between his freshman and sophomore years in dekalb “i went through the rest of college working every summer and every day parttime doing installs” drendel said after entering the national guard during the vietnam war drendel moved to hickory nc and continued working in the cable television industry in  he started running superior continental — which he called a “very small” wire and cable company — and later got the chance to buy the commscope product line “i had  my wife and i were living in a trailer” drendel said “i had a chance to buy it and i raised a million and a half dollars locally and bought it in ” drendel turned commscope into an international success under drendel’s leadership commscope has grown to a  billion global leader in infrastructure solutions for communications networks and has positioned itself as an industry leader in wireless business enterprise and cable televisionresidential broadband “we were about 0 million in sales at the time i bought it this year we’ll do about  billion” drendel said “there were less than half a million cable tv subscribers when i bought it  there are  billion subscribers today and you have to go with our equipment that’s how much market share we have every cell tower you see we have  percent of the world’s market for those antennas we supply probably  percent of all the coaxial cable fiberoptic cable for cable tv we operate in 0 countries “when i think about my days growing up in paxton the town had about  people when i was in school it’s amazing to think about the fact that today i have  employees three times the size of the town i grew up in” drendel has only returned a handful of times to his hometown of paxton in the past five decades when the yearold drendel returns to the paxton area on thursday morning he’ll be flying into willard airport in savoy on his own private jet later thursday he plans to have brunch with lifelong friend carl hudson jr of paxton before giving a presentation to students at pbl high school his message to the students will be clear “every time you don’t think there’s an opportunity there is an opportunity” to think drendel’s career could have been an opportunity missed if not for his former high school football coach’s insistence to pursue going to niu “without a doubt i would never have had this career if he had not so fortunately put me up there” drendel said drendel hasn’t forgotten his roots he remembers his days as an allconference selection and team captain on the mustangs football team he remembers how he finally got on the field during his junior year when two starters got injured he remembers how he set school records for most tackles per game his junior and senior years then went on to play center linebacker and outside linebacker at niu he thinks about how he lived on west center street just blocks from where the new high school would be built shortly after he graduated he still remembers the downtown he still remembers “shooting the u” with his classmates on weekends drendel never dreamed he would be where he is today or that he would be honored for his achievements by his hometown “it was a total surprise” drendel said drendel plans to be in paxton for thursday’s homecoming parade and friday’s homecoming game before departing late friday night or saturday morning login or register to post comments categories news peoplelocation local
