technologies are paying off  our belief that new communication access methods including mobile wireless broadband cable and other connectivity the traditional cordless telephony market using fixedline

for our traditional cordless telephony products and expect that price erosion and the decrease in the average selling prices of such products to continue and  our belief that our available cash and

report as dsp group we us our or company overview the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide investors with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations the discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto business overview dsp group is a leading global provider of wireless chipset solutions for converged communications delivering system solutions that combine semiconductors and software with reference designs we provide a broad portfolio of wireless chipsets integrating dect wifi pstn and voip technologies with stateoftheart application processors we also enable converged voice audio and data connectivity across diverse consumer products  from cordless and voip phones to home gateways and connected multimedia screens in addition our mobile segment products consist of products targeted at mobile iot and wearable device markets that incorporate our hdclear technology as well as other third party advanced voice processing always on and sensor hub functionalities a majority of our revenues is derived from products targeted for digital cordless telephony such revenues currently represent approximately  of our total revenues for the first quarter of  our revenues were  million for the first three months of  a  increase compared to the corresponding period of  the increase for the first quarter of  was primarily as a result of an increase in sales of our voip and cordless telephony products partially offset by decreased sales of our hdclear products revenues from our new products accounted for  of our total revenues for the first three months of  as compared to  of our total revenues for the first three months of  revenues derived from the sale of cordless telephony products represented  of our total revenues for the first quarter of  as compared to  of our total revenues for the first quarter of  sales of our home gateway products represented  of our total revenues for both first quarters of  and  sales of our voip products represented  of our total revenues for the first quarter  as compared to  of our total revenues for the first quarter of  revenues from our hdclear products represented  of our total revenues for the first quarter of  as compared to  of our total revenues for the first quarter of  we expect that revenues from some of our new products will continue to increase in  and expect such revenues to represent a higher percentage of  total revenues as compared to  our gross margin increased to  of our total revenues for the first quarter of  from  for the first quarter of  primary due to i an improvement in direct contribution and production yield of certain of our products and ii a change in the mix of products sold and mix of customers we anticipated that our gross margin on an annual basis will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as our product mix shifts in favor of new products which generally have higher gross margins our operating loss was  million for the first quarter of  as compared to an operating loss of  million for the first quarter of  the increase in our operating loss is attributed to an increase in total operating expenses for the first three months of  as compared to the corresponding period of  this was partially offset by an increase in total revenues and gross margin for the first three months of  as compared to the corresponding period of  our operating expenses increased by  to  million for the first quarter of  as compared to  million for the first quarter of  mainly as a result of an increase in equitybased compensation expenses for the first quarter of  as compared for the first quarter of  notwithstanding our success in increasing our gross margin as a percentage of our total revenues we expect that our financial condition will continue to be challenged by the expected decline of the cordless telephony market with the rapid deployment of new communication access methods including mobile wireless broadband cable and other connectivity the traditional cordless telephony market using fixedline telephony will continue to decline which will continue to reduce our revenues derived from and unit sales of cordless telephony products furthermore our business also may be significantly affected by the outcome of the competition between cellular phone operators and fixedline operators for the provision of residential communication a significant majority of our revenues are currently generated from sales of chipsets used in cordless phones that are based on fixedline telephony if we are unable to continue to develop new technologies to address alternative connectivity methods our business could be materially adversely affected we see evidence that our past research and development investments in new technologies are paying off we achieved a number of design wins for our new products and a number of such new products have begun mass shipments aggregate revenues derived from our new products were  and  of our total revenues for the first quarter of  and  respectively notwithstanding the loss of a design win for a flagship mobile phone based on a strong pipeline of design wins our current mix of new products and anticipated commercialization schedules of customers incorporating our new products we anticipate annual revenues generated from our new products in the voip home gateway and homeautomation domains will increase in  as compared to  however despite our successes thus far we can provide no assurances about our continued success in introducing new products and penetrating new markets as well as our predictions regarding market trends furthermore although our new products targeted for mobile devices home control  automation and enterprise voip solutions are gradually being introduced into the market market adoption of such products is at early stages and may require us to increase our research and development spending to capitalize on opportunities in those markets moreover although we have achieved a number of design wins with toptier oems for new products revenue generated from the commercialization of new products is a measured process as there is generally a long lead time from a design win to commercialization from initial product design win to volume production many factors could impact the timing andor amount of sales actually realized from the design win in addition to general price sensitivity and price erosion in the markets we operate the introduction of new products may accelerate price erosion of older products as a result we expect the market to remain price sensitive for our traditional cordless telephony products and expect that price erosion and the decrease in the average selling prices of such products to continue in addition our continued success and growth in new markets that we have recently gained market share which markets are highly competitive is highly dependent on our ability to be designed into future flagship products of toptier oems furthermore various other factors including increases in the cost of raw materials and commodities and our suppliers passing such increases onto us increases in silicon wafer costs and increases in production assembly and testing costs and shortage of capacity to fulfill our fabrication assembly and testing needs all may decrease our gross profit and harm our ability to grow our revenues in future periods as of march   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of  million and marketable securities and short term deposits of  million totaling  million results of operations total revenues the

      percentage of total revenues   the increase in revenues for the first quarter of  as compared to the same period in  was primarily as a result of increased sales of our cordless telephony voip

quarter of  as compared to the first quarter of  sales to our customers in taiwan increased for the first quarter of  as compared to the same period of  representing an increase of  in absolute dollars the increase in our sales to taiwan for the comparable periods resulted mainly from an increase in sales through our distributor ascend technology inc ascend technology sales to our customers in korea decreased for the first quarter of  as compared to the same period of  representing a decrease of  in absolute dollars resulted mainly from a decrease in demand from our tier one mobile customer as our products are generally incorporated into consumer electronics products sold by our oem customers our revenues are affected by seasonal buying patterns of consumer electronics products sold by our oem customers that incorporate our products as well as inventory correction cycles within the market significant customers the japanese and hong kong markets and the oems that operate in those markets are among the largest suppliers of residential wireless products with significant market share in the us market the loss of any of our significant customers or distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the following table represents our total revenues as a percentage of our total revenues from our significant

digital cordless telephony products represented  and  of our total revenues for the three months ended march   and  respectively we believe that sales of digital cordless telephony products will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenues for the remainder of  we believe that the rapid deployment of new communication access methods as well as the lack of growth in fixedline telephony will reduce our total revenues derived from and unit sales of cordless telephony products for the short and long term revenues from our home gateway products represented  of our total

the comparable periods was primarily due to i an improvement in direct contribution and production yield of certain of our products and ii a change in the mix of products sold and mix of customers as gross profit reflects the sale of chips and chipsets that have different margins changes in the mix of products sold have impacted and will continue to impact our gross profit in future periods our gross profit may decrease in the future due to a variety of factors including the continued decline in the average selling prices of our products changes in the mix of products sold our failure to achieve cost reductions rollout of new products in any given period our success in introducing new engineering processes to reduce manufacturing costs increases in the cost of raw materials such as gold oil and silicon wafers and increases in production assembly and testing costs moreover our suppliers may pass the increase in the cost of raw materials and commodities onto us which would further reduce the gross margins of our products there are no guarantees that our ongoing efforts in cost reduction and yield improvements will keep pace with the anticipated continuing decline in average selling prices of our products cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs of wafer manufacturing and fabrication assembly and testing of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs and compensation and associated expenses related to manufacturing and testing support inventory obsolesce and logistics personnel research and development expenses net our research and development expenses net increased to  million for the first quarter of  from  million for the first quarter of  the increase for the first quarter of  was mainly due to i a decrease in funding received from
