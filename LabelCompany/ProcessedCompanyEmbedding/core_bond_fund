widget loading  commentary as of june   quarter in review the jpmorgan core bond fund i class shares outperformed the benchmark the bloomberg barclays us aggregate index for the quarter ended june   results from the portfolio management team’s bottomup security selection process were on full display in the second quarter as they were able to add value in nearly every broad sector through security selection outperformance was especially high in abs and investmentgrade corporate bonds an underweight to us treasuries and an overweight to spread products including nonagency mortgages abs commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs and corporate bonds helped as spreads narrowed the funds duration and yield curve positioning were both headwinds in the previous quarter the fund was underweight in interest rate duration as intermediate and long rates fell in addition the fund was underweight in the bestperforming year portion of the curve the portfolio management team overweighted mbs and abs which underperformed other broad investmentgrade sectors on an absolute basis this was partially offset by positive security selection in these sectors looking ahead the portfolio management team continues to focus on providing clients with a highquality “true core” fixed income portfolio our process seeks high correlation with our benchmark and has historically delivered negative correlations to risky assets we continue to position the portfolio for the possibility of higher interest rates our lower duration underweight to the most volatile year portion of the curve and higher spread and carry versus the fund’s benchmark are all characteristics that could help us outperform the bloomberg barclays us aggregate index as rates rise fees and minimums fees

investments in derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments many derivatives create leverage which could lead to greater volatility and losses that significantly exceed the original investment the value of investments in mortgagerelated and assetbacked securities will be influenced by the factors affecting the housing market and the assets underlying such securities the securities may decline in value face valuation difficulties become more volatile andor become illiquid they are also subject to prepayment risk which occurs when mortgage holders refinance or otherwise repay their loans sooner than expected creating an early return of principal to holders of the loans the fund could experience a loss and its liquidity may be negatively impacted when selling securities to meet redemption requests by shareholders the risk of loss increases if the redemption requests are unusually large or frequent or occur in times of overall market turmoil or declining prices similarly large purchases of fund shares may adversely affect the funds performance to the extent that the

is no guarantee of future results diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no

global bond markets    the global bond markets are changing the global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities we believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixedincome landscape interest rates may challenge investors opportunities exist across the globe across the spectrum divergence in global growth lower liquidity may mean higher volatility can your portfolio keep up we believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns  overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their longterm investments
