of large and complex applications with working knowledge of geographic based problems vehicle routing problem solutions genetic algorithms and network traversal algorithms transportation costing for private fleets truckload carriers and less than truckload carriers i am currently looking for an opportunity in software development in the boston area primarily using the microsoft web development stack c javascript jquery sql server mvc and entity framework i would be especially interested in a position where i could put my geospatial mapping and transportation background to productive use welcome to my professional career web page about ron dombrowski business process review what i do best is to ask people about their business needs and strive to understand what they are trying to accomplish within the constraints of their business environment i have found that many businesses still use outdated practices simply because no one ever asks why they do something the way that they do at some point an organization will encounter a problem and come up with a solution this solution then becomes part of the group memory and becomes the basis for future decision this continues even when the original problem no longer applies and when everyone involved in solving the original problem has moved on the process becomes a preconcieved notion that is rarely if ever challenged by asking why questions critical thinking can be used to develop better ways to solve the new problems at hand i have also found that different stakeholders in the same organization may have very different views on what their business does and how they actually execute on a regular basis to analyze a situation i usually ask a question and if the answer does not make sense to me ask it again and maybe ask a question expecting an opposite answer this usually clarifies an issue but if i still dont think that the answers so far make sense i will ask the question again later in the middle of something else just to make sure that that there is an unwavering belief in the answer given when different stakeholders give different answers this usually leads to a meeting where the truth of how something works is finally disclosed business analyst critical thinking leads to analyzing and documenting processes once this has been done then the other skills of designing and developing a solution can be implemented i dont think that i have ever interviewed too many people when doing business analysis but at times i have interviewed too few the views of every stakeholder need to be considered i have often found that the views found in a corporate office are not the views of someone working in a field office or actually fulfilling an order the experience gained in doing many interviews and producing many design documents helps me to discover the real issues to be documented and addressed designer and developer i like to do at least a little bit of the actual development myself by understanding what the developers are doing it helps to appreciate the ramifications of the ongoing change to the design i work with software it is never finished until it is no longer used and has been withdrawn from circulation until then some stakeholder can request some change my basic rule is to design something that can be easilly changed because it will be vehicle routing problem solver many transportation problems are related problems commonly called vehicle routing problems vrp or the multiple traveling salesman problem mtsp both of these refer to problems where trips must be planned for one or more vehicles that must travel to one or more locations and must travel the shortest distance subject to objective maximum weight per vehicle for example and subjective time windows for example limits at information software rotec and intergis i designed applications that found practical solutions for long haul motor freight local pickup and delivery and service delivery applications after leaving intergis i wrote a new solver using a genetic algorithm this is part of a new application that has not yet been released the algorithm was designed to produce solutions that are either the most cost efficient or are very acceptable to field operations staff at a slightly higher cost the algorithm will also consider the multiple delivery modes private fleet less than truckload carriers truckload carriers and other courier services and will provide a solution using mixed mode at the lowest cost a simplified version of the algorithm was implemented at trade area systems to be used in a function that schedules groups of marketing representatives visiting selected stores although not seen in most vehicle routing applications i have developed algorithms to determine the most cost effective shipping on any given day using round trip private fleet vehicles ltl carriers and one way truckload carriers genetic algorithm designer in my earlier applications i used both the kopt and insertions algorithms to achieve good results in a reasonable amount of time but these algorithms were not suited for modern computer systems after i learned that genetic algorithms could be used to create geographic territories and could create lowest cost work assignments i took the time to figure out how the algorithms worked and how they could be implemented to use modern computer equipment with multiple processors to the fullest from this research i have developed high speed techniques that i used to solve various scheduling problems network traversal algorithm designer although we all use the get directions button on web pages and rarely think about the underlying technology there is a lot of work needed under the covers to get those directions starting in 9 i obtained map data built road network files and wrote code to find the best routes and get those directions when looking at transportation problems however there is more to the problem than just finding the best route between any two points in many cases the distance from one point to a large number other points is needed i wrote several algorithms that do this in not much more than the time needed to find the best route to only one other point most recently i wrote a road network traversal server application chauffeur for trade area systems this was a completly new design that uses bit memory space to cover a large area and provides routes in a timely fashion it also draws polygons around all intersections that are within a given time or distance from an origin location over the years i have worked with maps publc domain and us geological survey processed manually on digitizing tables dime files tiger files and most recently navteq files in every case i needed to write software that processed a specific file format to convert it to a binary file that could be used by the network traversal software in all i designed and developed four road network traversal products for dos  bit windows  bit windows and  bit windows all of them could route from one place to another or from one place to many other places contact email ronrondombrowskicom voice 0 9 other considerations us passport holder willing to relocate worldwide willing to travel extensively worldwide willing to work for extended periods away from primary domicile the man behind the lan in 97 i was working for datapoint a long gone and little remembered computer manufacturer i had an idea on how to get more users onto a computer and went to lunch with the head engineer i told him that we needed to hook two computers to a single disk he said he would think about and i never heard anything more later datapoint introduced the first computer network allowing hundreds of computers to share disks i never connected these two events until early in 03 when i found a history of computer networking on the internet and saw that the head engineer who invented this networking technology gave me the credit for getting him started who knew that a chance conversation over lunch would turn into an idea that would revolutionize computing read all about it getting the news out in 9 i was working for whalen computer services and developed a newspaper circulation application that was used to record delivery start stops and payments it was used mostly by smaller regional newspapers including several owned by gannett when gannett was getting ready to start publication of usa today they needed an application to keep track of the number of papers distributed to each sales location and decided that the whalen application is just what they needed so on the first day of publication every bundle of usa today was delivered with a bundle wrapper produced by the software i desinged and wrote paperless government in 99 when i was working for information software i developed the prophesy commercial mileage manager product that was used to determine the shortest route bewteen any two points in the united states this product was used by trucking companies to determine what to charge to haul freight at that time distance data had to be filed with the interstate commerce commission that regulated interstate trucking they were willing however to consider and electronic filing so i delivered a pc with our product to washington dc receiving the first accepted tariff filing pc by filing this tariff information software broke rand mcnallys virtual monopoly on providing this type of data but some want it in print in 99 the prophesy prodriver collection of distances between cities was published as the professional drivers mileage guide it was a spiral bound book that was small enough to be carried in a truck so a driver could quickly determine how far he had to go or how many miles he would have to drive for a load being offered to him award winning software i rotecs loadplanner was the first windows vehicle routing and scheduling app the maps were done by forcing the mapinfo application to display them inside the loadplanner app we won the mapinfo developer of the year award for figuring out how to do this award winning software ii at intergis i designed and led
