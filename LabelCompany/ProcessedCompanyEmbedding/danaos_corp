relations dimitris vastarouchas deputy coo iraklis prokopakis senior vpcootreasurer show more danaos corporation  about danaos  strategy nyse dac    volume  minimum  minute delay july   a a menu a a dr john coustaspresident  ceo dear shareholders the efficacy of our business strategy was evident in  a year that saw overcapacity tough competition and the beginning of new alliances after the chinese authorities rejected the p alliance among maersk line cma cgm and msc which would have allowed the carriers to effectively control the industry  danaos corporation remained protected from market volatility with our strong charter coverage and efficient costeffective operations additionally we continued to deleverage and improve our balance sheet and to tactically upgrade our fleet significantly this year our legacy interest rate swaps began to expire these have been negatively impacting our profitability for several years with no imminent dramatic increase in interest rates and with an international deflationary outlook our financial performance will continue to improve as the interest rate swaps expire  we have also managed to keep our expenses among the lowest in the industry and have also benefited from the strong dollar as our euro denominated costs improve significantly in  danaos completed an extensive newbuilding program in which we received delivery of  modern vessels with aggregate capacity of  teu from hyundai samho heavy industries each of these vessels was backed by a longterm time charter to a major liner company we are managing our fleet very conservatively and have invested in some smaller much younger vessels to replace vessels built prior to  that we sold for scrap following our  deliveries we decided to retire some older tonnage and sold  vessels all built prior to  and we replaced them with  newer mostly post  built vessels in sizes ranging between  –  teu  these vessels operate in niche markets where we expect to see good demand  supply dynamics  now that all the “old guard” went for scraping we are left with a very modern fleet to which we have applied state of the art technology to optimize performance  we are actively engaged in research on the optimization of the fuel consumption on our existing fleet as well as several other exciting technological innovations that will allow us to maintain our competitive edge in the containership market the container charter market saw a significant increase in panamax rates during the first quarter of  due to increased demand resulting from port congestion in the us west coast and the continued shrinkage of the world panamax fleet the delay in the opening of the new panama canal will further help to absorb panamax tonnage in the short term while delays caused by port congestion in the us west coast have resulted in increased demand in the asia to us east coast all water service these factors have positively affected teu mile demand in the industry additionally niche markets have begun to show signs of strength  in particular demand in north south markets was relatively healthy and there was growth in intraasia markets driven by new production in lower cost asian countries that created a trade multiplier with china we believe that “containerization” will continue to grow as a multiple to world gdp over the long term  in addition we have seen more and more heavy cargoes such as steel products bagged cement and grain shipped in containers the increasing carrying capacity of containerships has encouraged shippers to “containerize” more heavy cargoes in order to reduce shipping costs danaos corporation’s strategy has always been to secure longterm commitments from top tier charterers we seek to obtain charters of greater than  years for our panamax vessels and greater than  years for postpanamax vessels this allows danaos to limit its downside revenue risk and maintain good cash flow visibility as of the date of this writing our diverse portfolio of customers includes  out of the  major liner companies we have forged these strong relationships over decades by providing outstanding customer service always pursuing operational excellence and developing leadingedge expertise in the technology that serves the industry we have also remained committed to rigorous operational standards and a steadfast commitment to the safety of our crews and environmental protection the current market dynamic presents danaos with an opportunity to consolidate our business and concentrate on what we are best at operating our vessels safely and efficiently  part of our ability to manage our business has always been our significant understanding of ship technology  for the past two decades we have put a great deal of emphasis on the technology aspects of our business and have taken part in various research and development projects that have made us more efficient and have benefited our industry i strongly believe that technology will continue to be a competitive advantage for years to come last year was undeniably challenging for the containership market but as a company we have come through stronger and have already begun to reap the benefits in the firming charter market in   having prospered through multiple growth cycles of the shipping industry we believe we are very well positioned to continue our growth plan as market conditions present compelling opportunities respectfully dr john coustas president  ceo connect corporate co danaos shipping co ltd  akti kondyli   piraeus greece
