advertisement momentive performance materials inc pbn products october   reprints no comments momentive performance materials inc recently launched a new product line of pyrolytic boron nitride pbn crucibles heaters and coatings for the enhancement of the production of copper indium gallium selinide cigs solar cells compared to other ceramic materials pbn potentially provides a higher level of chemical and thermal stability and a lower total cost of ownership due to the relatively low wetting of pbn by most molten metals it typically withstands the high temperature and high volume throughput demands of cigs solar cell manufacturing with minimal deterioration “we’re confident that our new pyrolytic boron nitride products will deliver exceptional performance and longevity for cigs solar cell manufacturers” said john mariner heater systems product manager momentive quartz and ceramics “with these new products we’ve built upon the capabilities of materials long used in the demanding semiconductor manufacturing environment” pbn is an anistropic hightemperature ceramic that exhibits a unique combination of high electrical resistance and good thermal conductivity this nontoxic nonporous compound is exceptionally pure by virtue of the synthesis process hightemperaturelowpress chemical vapor deposition it can be deposited or easily machined into a wide variety of shapes including crucibles boats tubes bottles and machined plate products as a coating on graphite it may help protect heaters and evaporation sources from the corrosive effect of molten metals pbn’s directional thermal conductivity provides excellent “heat spreading” capability for improved temperature uniformity the combination of high strength good thermal conductivity and a low coefficient of thermal expansion makes the materials extremely resistant to thermal shock for additional information call   or   or visit wwwmomentivecom linksmomentive performance materials inc did you enjoy this
