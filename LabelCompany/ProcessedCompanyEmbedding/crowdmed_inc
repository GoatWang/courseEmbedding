otherwise baffled medical professionals    view all press the traditional medical system doesnt always work  billion are wasted every year on unresolved medical cases a patient with uncommon symptoms must go from specialist to specialist—whose diagnoses may differ from one to another—before they can even begin treatment we are eliminating those unnecessary steps by giving patients access to thousands of experts right from their computer  of families suffer from an unresolved medical issue after seeing  physicians  of physicians believe their cases were resolved when they actually were not  of cases eventually cost more than k to resolve we bring the experts to the patients our medical detectives discuss collaborate and help diagnose illnesses our  medical detectives review the patients symptoms and formulate consensus diagnostic and solution suggestions the patient can take their final report to their preferred physician and start getting treated as soon as possible they can spend their time healing instead of searching for answers patients anonymously fill out an online questionnaire or use our concierge service upload medical records imaging and diagnostic test

start crowdmed after watching my little sister suffer for three miserable years with undiagnosed medical condition as she bounced from doctor to doctor i witnessed how illequipped our medical system is to help people with complex illnesses thanks to a perfect storm of overspecialization lack of care coordination redundant testing overmedication misaligned incentives and more since launching our site in  i’ve read thousands of crowdmed patient stories eerily similar to my sister’s and was shocked to learn than  out of  american families have experienced an unresolved medical issue after seeing multiple physicians this is why crowdmed must exist the problem is that outside of a few expensive interdisciplinary hospitals medicine remains an individual sport crowdmed is making it a team sport harnessing the collective intelligence of a global medical community rather than requiring a patient to see one doctor at a time after resolving  realworld medical mysteries to date with dramatic validated improvements in cost time and clinical outcomes we’ve proven that our approach works much better while our company is proud to be backed by some of the top venture capital firms in

improving education championing common sense immigration reform and fostering innovative solutions to social issues more investors more investors details expand all what is crowdmed crowdmed is a website for harnessing the medical wisdom of crowds online the media has called us a crowdsourced doctor house if a patient has a medical condition that is difficult to diagnose or difficult to resolve they post their case on our site we then have a community of thousands of medical experts—medical detectives—from all over the world who collaborate on our platform to solve the patients case can you tell us how does the platform work from the patient’s perspective patients register for an account on crowdmedcom which only takes a couple minutes they then complete our patient questionnaire where we ask them questions about their symptoms their medical history what medications theyre taking and all the details we need to understand their medical condition in order to collect all the clues that our medical detectives might need the patient can also upload medical records their diagnostic test results any other types of medical information that might be useful all of this is done completely anonymously once the patient has submitted their information they then select one of our three service packages the service packages vary in terms of which types of medical detectives may participate in the case and also what level of cash reward is associated with their case that cash reward of course helps attract our best and brightest detectives from there the medical detectives may ask questions via chat may ask for additional test results or any type of detail on the patients symptoms they may ask the patient if certain diagnoses or treatments have been already attempted they are trying to understand a patients case and gather all information they might need the patient will also start receiving diagnostic and solution suggestions from our community they could even watch as the community debates why they think a certain diagnosis or solution is likely correct all this happens with full transparency in front of the patient at the end of the process when the patient feels theyve had enough information they take their case down which is when their subscription fees stop accruing they get a pdf format that summarizes all of the findings of their crowdmed case which they have been instructed to share with their treating physician what kind of patients come to you our patients come with a wide variety of different types of ailments the one thing that all of our patients have in common is theyve all seen at least a couple of physicians yet theyre still seeking answers they dont have a diagnosis they think is the correct cause so they dont have the correct treatment plan while we do accept cases from a wide variety of different types the two most common categories we see are either autoimmune or neurological the reason for that is probably because these conditions are often very difficult to diagnose how do patients find you were getting so much organic traffic that were not actually spending any money right on marketing we get tens of thousands of organic website visitors every month the way these patients find us first of all is by searching online if you go to google right now and type in “difficult medical case” were the first result even if you type in something as broad as “online medical diagnosis” were in the first few results the second way is through media crowdmed has enjoyed a lot of press since every since our very early days and we have been featured on dozens of tv programs just about every print publication you can think of radio programs npr you name it the third way which is equally important is through word of mouth they hear about us through other patients and sometimes even their physician how does the platform work from the medical detective’s perspective a detective signs up for an account free of charge we ask them a few questions about their medical background and check their license number and medical credentials once weve verified their credentials they get additional influence and privileges on our site if theyre not a licensed medical professional they can still sign up for the site but they have more limited privileges for example anything they say has to be individually approved by the case moderator whos always a licensed physician before the patient even sees it at any given point in time we typically have  or  active cases on the site which medical detectives can browse through we’ve created tools to make it easy for the detectives to find the cases that match their unique expertise for example if youre a neurologist you search for only neurological cases once you have found a case that interests you you can view the full case history you see all of the information submitted by the patient including their responses to our patient questionnaire and any medical details or information that theyve uploaded you can see the history of that case all the questions that have been asked to the patient by other detectives and how the patient has answered them you can see all the discussion threads around particular diagnostic or solution suggestions then you can start participating in the case right away you can ask real questions to the patient you can start participating in the discussion threads you can make new diagnostic or solution suggestions to supplement those that have already been formally made in that case finally you can allocate points to what you think is the most probably correct diagnostic or solution idea you can win points and cash by making smart allocations finally once the case has closed on our site within  days the patient comes back and tells us what was the best answer they received and how was their experience and who was the most helpful detectives the detectives receive that feedback they also learn how much points and cash they won in that case based on their performance what are the motivations of a medical detective its really a mix between financial and nonfinancial incentives on the financial side our top detectives make tens of thousands of dollars solving cases on our site there is substantial money to be made by a high performing detective based on performance none of our incentives or cash rewards are based on participation  its all based on performance the average cash reward on a given crowdmed case is about  that money goes to the detective or detectives who performed best on that casewhen we survey the detectives they often say financial incentives are not their top motivation they mention things like intellectual challenge and how crowdmed provides interesting cases not often seen in clinical practice medical detectives also mention the learning aspect how they really get to learn from their peers across different specialties and different geographies they also mention altruism they say that crowdmed allows them to help patients very directly and without the headaches of clinical practice worrying about liability and dealing with insurance companies weve found engagement among the detectives to be pretty high if theyre good weve created an almost tournament structure where anybody can sign up but only the strongest survive our average detective participates in  or more cases over the course of their time on the site what does the market look like for you we did a survey of n american households to understand how many patients need our service—and the results seemed surprisingly high even to us what we found is that one out of three households in the us has a family member who had an unresolved medical condition even after seeing two or more physicians thats how we define our target population anyone with an unresolved medical condition after seeing two or more physicians we also found that half these families say that the condition remains unresolved to date which means that roughly one out of six families should have an immediate need for what we do were therefore estimate that if there are about  people per household conservatively maybe  or so of the general population currently has an unresolved medical condition after seeing multiple physicians were also estimating that if we work with a health plan in any given year we would actually engage maybe about  of that so were estimating about a  overall adoption rate with any given population any given year why would health plans want to partner with crowdmed our patients have a x preference for crowdmed over the traditional medical system which is not surprising given that its so much more efficient for them and we have a high success rate thats something that also interests health plans not only do they want to reduce their costs but they care about having a differentiated offering in a highly competitive environment and frankly a highly commoditized market the health plans primarily view us as an roi mechanism but they also care about the fact that we can improve the engagement of their members and perhaps improve member loyalty how fast are you growing how are you measuring growth weve had over  medical detectives register on our site weve had over  patients register on our site weve had over half a million unique visitors to the site weve had to date over  cases that have been submitted on crowdmed of those weve had about  that have been activated on the site and eventually resolved on the site with about a  success rate which is very high given the degree of difficulty of these cases and the fact that our average patient has already seen more than half a dozen physicians what’s been your largest challenge so far in terms of barriers to growth our biggest barrier is our pricing its not inexpensive to submit a crowdmed case patients pay about  or  on average which you could look at as a small amount given the importance of ones health but  or  is a lot to pay out of pocket for something that your health insurance wont reimburse for our price point and the fact that its an out of pocket expense really has been a barrier to growth we cant really reduce that price because we need to have enough financial incentives built into our pricing to motivate our detectives a big portion of what patients pay us is passed along to detectives as their cash reward how will you overcome that price barrier challenge our plan to overcome that barrier is to partner with health plans and make crowdmed something health plan cover instead of having the patient pay for it out of pocket which would then change from something costing several hundred dollars to something thats free for them we have much higher conversion rates when a patient doesnt have to pay it’s also good for the health plan we found that for every  paid for a crowdmed case that patients overall medical costs go down by about  in the first year its a substantial roi for a health plan sponsoring a crowdmed case its a real winwin scenario health plans will end up paying similar to what our patients pay today  to  per case which for them is less costly than one mri how would the relationship between crowdmed and health plans benefit each other many health plans have hundreds of thousands to millions of members thats a great population for crowdmed to be able to tap intotheres an academic paper that was published this year in the journal of medical internet research the jmir this paper was written by some academic researchers at the nyu school of medicine who analyzed actual medical claims for crowdmed patients submitted to their health plan they looked at what patients cost their health plan the  months prior to crowdmed versus through  to  months post crowdmed and they found we reduced the patients costs by about  on average which equates to about x roi in the first year they also found our patients had been sick for many years and seen many physicians and if we could intervene earlier in their diagnostic odyssey we can increase that roi from x to probably much more thats our big value to health plans to start mining their claims data and really pinpoint those patients who are likely to need crowdmed before theyve gone too far down that path what are the next steps for crowdmed to grow we’ve decided to shift our business model from a bc to a bb model because the willingnesstopay issue we found amongst patients was proving a tough bottleneck so we started reaching out to health plans earlier this year im pleased to say weve had a very warm reception when we talked to the chief medical officer of a health plan they say yes this is a known problem for us we realize that we have this small subset of patients that are driving up a lot of costs for us but we realize there hasn’t been a solution for these patients other than bouncing from doctor to doctor its an expensive problem and one that health plans know know about and are eager to solve theres really no other solution out there what’s your progress been with health plans weve already had three health plans agree to a paid crowdmed pilot these are major health plans among them is one of the top  largest health plans in the country another is a large blue cross blue shield plan collectively the blue cross blue shield family of plans insures about one out of three americans so the growth potential with them is enormous we even have one of the largest health plans in australia doing a pilot with usif those pilots go well we can eventually gain access to all of their members all of these health plans have over a half million members the largest health plan were working with has over  million members were estimating about  million in revenue per year per  covered patient lives within their population what are your risks and disadvantages we know theres a need out there we know crowdmed provides value we know that health plans are interested the biggest hurdle we have to overcome is execution can we hire the right salespeople to go from  pilots to  or  pilots will those pilots convert into fullscale engagements theres every reason to think they should but it takes time well have to also make sure that these pilots go as well as they should and mirror our historical success ratesone huge disadvantage in working with health plans is theyre slow moving health plans are very bureaucratic organizations for us its just a matter of an month sales cycle to actually get a health plan working with us at scale we have to be ready to weather that storm this is why we want to raise money right now so weve got the resources to make it to the other end of that process how will your model evolve as you scale weve always had a surplus of medical detectives relative to patient demand because patient demand is constrained by this willingnesstopay issue and because detectives genuinely enjoy solving cases on our site and find our incentive structure quite motivating we havent had a shortage of medical detectives in years we could handle a several times increase in our patient volume without adding a single new detective that being said if these pilots convert into full scale engagements then we would have a detective shortage to combat that weve already figured out the best scalable channels for us to recruit more detectives what works well for us are facebook and google ads we have done some testing in the past to find that we can scalably recruit detectives for a cost of about  per detective if we had to rely solely on say active practicing physicians recruiting costs might be a lot higher because we have such a diverse audience and because we can work with everything from physicians to med students to nurses to alternative medical providers that actually reduces our recruitment cost per detective quite dramatically how do you make money how is that distributed to medical detectives for every dollar paid to us by a patient crowdmed ends up receiving more than half as gross margin one advantage of our business model is were essentially a saas company were providing a software product and our detectives are doing all the work from our perspective as a company the process is  automated from when a patient first visits our site all the way until they get their final report in fact if we had  times as many cases tomorrow it would barely increase our workload at all its fairly high margin and highly scalable business modelour biggest cost is the cash that we pass along to the detectives as their incentive however because detectives only get paid on our site based on performance if the patient says that none of the detectives were helpful and none of their diagnostic solutions worked the detectives don’t get paid anything at all tell us about the team the founding team is me axel setyanto whos our lead developer and jessica greenwalt who is our lead designer jessica is actually not fulltime with the company right now but shes still a cofounder and still helps us out that was our core founding team which was fantastic for building a product getting it to market after launch weve hired more people on the marketing side the partnership side and also on the ux side theres now over half a dozen of us at the company including customer support and a medical advisor weve got all the
