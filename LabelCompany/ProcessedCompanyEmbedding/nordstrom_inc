strategy for beating everyone else in retail ashley lutz oct    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print nordstrom is one of the best investments in retail reuters nordstrom is outperforming every other retail company   the companys shares have gained  in five years the company is wellpositioned to continue that success in the future according to a recent report by deutsche bank  the department store has focused on a few aspects of the business to stand out  heres how nordstrom is beating retailers from macys to tj maxx   great customer service  throughout their history they have consistently provided some of the best service in the industry said robin lewis ceo of the robin report and coauthor with michael dart of the new rules of retail – competing in the world’s toughest marketplace  nordstrom is choosy about hiring nice capable people according to forbes  customers love the return policy nordstrom will take back any merchandise people bring back no questions asked  the topnotch customer service is a big part of nordstroms longterm success lewis said  the companys share price over the past five years yahoo finance  the outlet business  nordstrom rack is a huge cash machine for the company edward hertzman founder and publisher of retail publication sourcing journal told business insider  there is only a  overlap between nordstrom rack customers and the highend department store meaning that plenty of people are still paying fullprice too the outlets have given them exposure to a completely different customer who is all about value hertzman said  nordstrom has opened more than  rack locations since  and has plans to build dozens more  a shopper checks a shoe as she walks down an aisle in a nordstrom rack in chicago associated press  reaching young customers nordstrom has solved one of the biggest problems facing retailers reaching millennial customers lewis said  the outlet business gives nordstrom exposure to young customers who are seeking a deal and otherwise wouldnt be shopping there he said the company believes that the younger customer will migrate into the fullline stores as they grow older while lewis believes there is a risk of the outlet business diluting the brands image he says that brands like nordstrom that offer a variety of brands are less atrisk than name brands like michael kors  they have a breadth of brands so having outlets might not tarnish the nameplate he said  nordstroms omnichannel strategy helps it resonate with young customers nordstrom  emphasizing omnichannel  nordstrom is determined to be the worlds top omnichannel retailer this company is at the forefront of ecommerce and omnichannel retail lewis said  nordstrom recently made it possible to instantly buy the items featured on instagram  workers also merchandise stores using input from its pinterest page items that are popular on the social media site are featured more prominently on the sales floor  nordstrom has also aggressively invested in ecommerce investing in mens brands bonobos and trunk club and its own flashsale site hautelook nordstrom has spent more than a billion dollars investing in this aspect of the
