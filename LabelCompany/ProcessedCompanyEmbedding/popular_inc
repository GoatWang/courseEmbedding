ii was released in  just  months after the very first apple computer the apple i unlike that apple i which was assembled in jobss parents garage the apple ii signalled the apple cofounders early drive some years later he was reported as saying my dream for the apple ii was to sell the first real packed computer the apple ii duly became the fastestselling personal computer of its time fetching m in sales in  the first macintosh facebook twitter pinterest the macintosh k was released in january  with all the showbiz of a car launch and what a launch it was no technology company would have dared dream about flaunting a personal computer in a multimilliondollar superbowl slot but apple did the macintosh j was different thought – it wasnt especially for business or bespectacled engineers it was comparatively easy to use the imac three years after his return to apple in  jobs urged the world to think different but no one anticipated the imac the computer that kickstarted apples fortunes and propelled the company to where it is today as the guardian review from  may  noted nobody who attended last weeks product launch expected to find the most radical macintosh since the original hit the streets  years ago … there isnt even a floppy drive the ipod facebook twitter pinterest unveiled a decade ago this month the ipod is the one device that transformed apple from a computer company into a massmarket electronics giant – and would later spark a revolution in digital music though many who bought it had to hack their computers to store music on it the firstgeneration ipod was a stylish mp player boasting a hour battery life and space for  songs listening to music will never be the same again said jobs at its launch in october  the ipod nano steve jobs discontinued the ipod mini at the height of its popularity in september  his indefatigable drive for design and efficiency saw it replaced with the much smaller nano apple reinvented the nano in september  with its sixth iteration at g the new nano was g lighter than its predecessor and half the height the iphone facebook twitter pinterest less than half a decade after the ipod apple was already the biggest name in digital music after months of rumour and anticipation jobs in january  unveiled what would quickly become apples killer product the phone was a hit with techies and nontechies alike a typically fervent stephen fry reviewed the iphone four months after its launch beauty charm delight excitement ooh aah wow let me at it he wrote in the guardian with the fifth incarnation unveiled earlier this week the excitement has not yet dissipated itunes until jobs unveiled itunes in january  no one had been able to convince music label executives that people might pay for songs online announced at the back end of a minute keynote to launch the new macintosh itunes was an unexciting allinone digital music program that brought together mp playback internet radio and cd writing this week apple began letting people access their digital music across any of their devices wirelessly it is the beginning of apples cloud revolution the ipad apples socalled jesus tablet was everything that everyone didnt need on its launch in january  less than a year later apple had invented a new market and intentionally spawned hundreds of poorman copycats dubbed the oversized iphone with a in screen apples leanback device would be the saviour of the media industry research group gartner last month forecast that tablet computers will see an explosion in sales over the next four years selling  as many units as pcs by  – and apples ipad will still have almost half the market by then ios app store apple announced a new milestone for its app store in july this year bn downloads of more than  apps since it launched in july  the app store has become the cornerstone to the iphones success with the worlds media giants all scrambling for a prominent place on the smartphone of choice – and spawning a new market for
