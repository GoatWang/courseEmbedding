deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment based on consideration of these items management has determined that enough uncertainty

mass market tourist souvenirs  corporate gifts souvenirs and insignia  individually designed laser engraved glass products for personal use as an element of interior design or memento success of our business plan will depend on the flow of tourists business climate and economic progress of bulgaria and the region a downturn of tourism particularly and of the corporate sector in general can adversely affect our intended business   we will distribute our laser engraved glass products in bulgaria and neighboring countries we plan to use various distribution channels for various types of customers we plan to distribute massmarket souvenirs via supermarkets of large retail chains tourist shops and kiosks corporate clients and individual clients will be covered by our web page and

director anatoliy kanev will market our product and negotiate with potential customers and wholesale buyers we intend to develop and maintain a database of potential corporate clients who may be interested in our products we will follow up with these clients periodically and offer them free samples presentations and special discounts from time to time we plan to attend trade shows in our industry to exhibit our products with a view to find new customers   three main categories of our clients are   · tourists coming to spend their vacations to bulgaria and neighboring countries first of all we rely on the tourism potential of bulgaria in   mln tourists visited bulgaria tourists from greece romania and turkey comprise  of all persons attending the country tourism sector in bulgaria constituted  of gdp having provided for  workplaces in  during three summer months of  the average amount of tourists in bulgaria reached  mln persons per month  of whom came from the european union which in turn suggests serious potential solvent demand for our products in the recent years the average annual increment of tourists in bulgaria has comprised  when marketing our products to this segment of the market we plan to cooperate with both local retailers of tourist products tourist shops kiosks tents etc and larger wholesalers tourist agencies retail chains etc · individual customers will address us in order to get laser engravings on glass based on their individual preferences or designs or designs developed by us   · corporate clients representing large medium and smallscale businesses various associations etc this is a rather substantial segment of the market which grows and regularly generates demand for various corporate gifts souvenirs items that promote brand awareness etc   competition   we know that there are a number of obstacles to entering the market of laser engravings on glass objects and the competition is rather high there are several companies smartarts and laser d that offer similar services and products and we will have to compete with them we see the main competitive advantage of our competitors in the established customer base and marketing outlets but review of products of our competitors shows that our products are more exclusive our assortment of products is wider delivery times are faster quality is better approaches to business are more flexible and very importantly our equipment is more modern and efficient than that of the competitors which gives us good chances for occupying a considerable market niche attracting new customers will be also supported by a clientoriented approach of unicobe corp accentuating practical mutually beneficial cooperation with all the clients   one of our biggest competitive advantages is that our engraving machine is modern and efficient this means that we are able to produce more products at the same period of time using fewer resources such as electricity accompanying raw materials and consumables for the machine the modern machine that is at our disposal also provides a wider range of creative possibilities at creating laserengraved products therefore allowing for another serious competitive advantage faster delivery time by unicobe corp first of all means the way we see our interaction with individual clients one of the business operations of unicobe corp is the selling of glass products manufactured according to the unique designs submitted by individual clients dedicated to special occasions events memorable moments etc   some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows  number of competitors increase other companies may follow our business model of distributing laser engraved glass billets which will reduce our competitive edge  price our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell our product at a loss         substitute products competitors may substitute laser engraved glass billets with similar products from plastic   marketing   the sales strategy will be based on communicating that owning a product by unicobe corp either a massmarket souvenir or a highend customsmade model is a source of pride and appreciation memorable products by unicobe corp attracts attention as a piece of interior design always staying in sight be it an individual customer or large corporate client or a tourist our products may also be considered as a longterm investment since the life cycle of our products is rather lengthy and the design stays uptodate almost infinitely especially given the fact that we plan to affix every product including those distributed via retail points with a business card with information about unicobe corp information about the product and contact details and in order to enhance the feeling of uniqueness of our products we may also indicate a unique reference number on the business card to accompany each unicobe corp product   we plan to distribute our products via several distribution channels simultaneously as regards to the tourism segment we plan to cooperate with retailers kiosks tourist souvenir shops etc and wholesalers supermarkets large retail chains tourism agencies   individual and corporate clients will be brought in first of all thanks to our prospective webpage advertising in crowded areas and online promotion of our company in case of large corporate clients we also plan to focus on personal contacts with pr departments of large companies presentations of our products distribution of promotional leaflets free samples and other measures to facilitate brand awareness of unicobe corp   among others we also intend to use such marketing strategies as web advertisements direct mailing and phone calls to acquire potential customers we plan to develop a website to market and display our products as of the date of this filing we have already purchased a website wwwunicobecorpcom and plan to develop it to accomplish this we plan to contract an independent web designing company our website will describe our product in detail show our contact information and include some general information and pictures of our laser engraved products available designs etc we intend to attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics such as registering with top search engines using selected key words and metatags and utilizing link and banner exchange options we intend to promote our website by displaying it on our promotion materials   we also plan to attend some trade shows and souvenir exhibitions to show our products with a view to find new customers we will intend to continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures if we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed   description of property   the company has signed a rental agreement with elica valentinova for a oneyear term with the opportunity of expansion the monthly rental fee is    insurance   we do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future because we do not have any insurance if we are made a party of a products liability action we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation if that occurs a judgment

more customers to buy our product mr kanev has agreed to commit more time as required because mr kanev will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted which could result in a lack of revenues   there is no assurance that our company will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued working capital requirements   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon public offering and achieving a profitable level of operations the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments   due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses in their report on our audited financial statements our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business   limited operating history need for additional capital   there is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our

processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure          we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december   based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december   using the criteria established in “internal control  integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso     a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december   the company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses as described below         we do not have an audit committee – while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee it is the management’s view that such a committee including a financial expert member is an utmost important entity level control over the company’s financial statements currently the board of directors acts in the capacity of the audit committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities         we did not maintain appropriate cash controls – as of december   the company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for cash including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions and did not require dual signatures on the company’s bank accounts alternatively the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the company had limited transactions in its bank accounts         we did not implement appropriate information technology controls – as at december   the company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the company’s data or offsite storage of data in the event of theft misplacement or loss due to unmitigated factors   accordingly the company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls   as a result of the material weaknesses described above management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by coso
