on september   a trade catalog and price lists from this early period can be found at the smithsonian institution in march  a feldon represented microsemiconductor corp in the advisory panel of suppliers at the ieee session on components for miniaturized electronic assemblies according to the missiles and rockets magazine in  molecular packaging of integrated circuits has been suggested by microsemiconductor corp this would involve the same process the company uses for diodes it supplies to the improved minuteman program microsemiconductor is cited in  as supplier of miniature silicon diodes that are ideal to use as beam profile detectors or to measure depthdose distribution of small collimated beams by university of californias ernest o lawrence radiation laboratory in  two of the companys engineers esresnond and mw stillwell published a production engineering measures study on high voltage oscillators as of  microsemiconductors address was still  plaza court culver city ca  on august   standard resources corporation from copiague new york a closeend management investment company filed at the us securities and exchange commission a request to merge with microsemiconductor this request disclosed that the major shareholders of microsemiconductor as of may   were arthur feldon  steve manning  and thomas c hall  at the end of the proposed merger the company would retain the name microsemiconductor at the time jm kaplans jemkap inc owned  of the outstanding common shares of standard which would make him the owner of  of the surviving company standard resources and microsemiconductor merged in november   to  the philip frey jr yearsedit according to the orange county business journal in  the new york operation was spun off and philip frey jr was brought on from teledyne incs semiconductor division in hawthorne to head microsemiconductor at the time the company had annual sales of about  almost entirely to defense industry customers in  the company moved from culver city to santa ana california microsemi still was almost exclusively a defense business in  but by then sales were close to  million that same year the company did a  million convertible bond offering the proceeds of which were used to acquire about a dozen companies most of them struggling bargain buys when the acquisitions began straining profitability frey didnt waste a lot of time admitting his mistake in  microsemi began selling them off sales which hit a thenhigh of  million in  fell to  million by  but theyve grown almost every year since and are expected by analysts to exceed  million for the fiscal year just ended  on july   jemkap inc acquired  of microsemiconductor class a stock and microsemisemiconductor acquired the siemens components group in scottsdale arizona microsemiconductor renamed itself to microsemi in february  on march   microsemi at the time a supplier of highperformance semiconductor diodes in a variety of military industrial and commercial products issued  million shares of common stock up until this time jacob m kaplan of new york owned or controlled  of the company shares and was  yearsold microsemi raised  million in the

are the development manufacturing and high reliability testing of semiconductors to meet stringent aerospace satellite medical and security standards in july  microsemi acquired unitrodes semiconductor products division in february  microsemis stock crashed  because of a cash crunch microsemi has been restructuring for several years as defense budget cuts have slowed its sales in  the company said it planned to sell or close  subsidiaries not related to its core business of manufacturing computer chips for use in electronics equipment ranging from military weapons to heart pacemakers the company sold four subsidiaries shut down one combined two and retained three the company took  million in writeoffs during the past three years in connection with the restructuring in

in st flannan’s school in ennis microsemi works closely with the industrial development authority ida ireland which is responsible for attracting and developing overseas investment in ireland support from ida ireland was a key factor in the company’s decision to invest in the region between  and  microsemi acquired timing companies the timing business of maxim integrated products symmetricom in addition to zarlink in november  jim peterson promoted paul pickle to coo and president retaining the ceo position and accumulating the position of chairman of the board in  microsemi established a

microsemiconductor corp in the advisory panel of suppliers at the ieee session on components for miniaturized electronic assemblies according to the missiles and rockets magazine in  molecular packaging of integrated circuits has been suggested by microsemiconductor corp this would involve the same process the company uses for diodes it supplies to the improved minuteman program microsemiconductor is cited in  as supplier of miniature silicon diodes that are ideal to use as beam profile detectors or to measure depthdose distribution of small collimated beams by university of

microsemiconductor corp in the advisory panel of suppliers at the ieee session on components for miniaturized electronic assemblies according to the missiles and rockets magazine in  molecular packaging of integrated circuits has been suggested by microsemiconductor corp this would involve the same process the company uses for diodes it supplies to the improved minuteman program microsemiconductor is cited in  as supplier of miniature silicon diodes that are ideal to use as beam profile detectors or to measure depthdose distribution of small collimated beams by university of

firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
