total           helpfulness newest rating helpfulness mike averill great service and support i have been using the ultimate version for over a year due to a communication issue between google and filethis my subscription was downgraded to the basic plan a few months ago before i realized it it only took customer support a few hours to get me back to the ultimate plan and they comped me for the

button and exit the app dont know if these issues exist in the pro version but im not willing to find out ashley smith the computer based program is ok but with the app youre not able to view the bill

august   excellent idea well worth not spending a few days at the end of the year full review justin pied piper april   great app good stuff on this app very up to date only thing i noticed was the connections are limited i know this is a lot of work to get it all going but it could use more businesses i have several things theres no hookup for for example gamefly just for one also if you cant do it connection wise it would help if there was a manual input of a recurring fee just to keep track i may be off base though good stuff though keep it going full review filethis inc april   hey justin thanks for the nice review you can actually forward emails and documents to your filethis account use your personal filethis email address under settings and we are also adding more connections  chris olonzo february   great service buggy app filethis is a fantastic service if they could work out the many bugs in the app id give it  stars as it stands you can work around the bugs by simply using the web app really guys the android app sucks one of the buggiest apps ive ever used shame full review filethis inc february   hey chris thanks for the feedback we would love to get your feedback on certain issues would you mind contacting us at supportfilethiscom best regards filethis angela wiggins april   no help button i like the idea but seems to focus more on selling the upgrade before helping you learn how to use it spent more time looking for help than actually using the app why would i buy it if i havent had the opportunity to successfully try it out i got stuck in a cycle when adding an account they kept asking me for answer to a security question that was not my question so i didnt have an answer full review filethis inc april   hi angela here is a link to the help website httphelpfilethiscom best regards filethis mike hardin august   great service just downloaded the app so my review is really for the service not the app im not sure how helpful the app will be since im sending my documents to evernote my biggest complaint with the service is that if you use a credit union or local bank you are going to be pretty much out of luck connecting im not sure why if mint can do it why cant filethis full review daniel weeks february   its alright for now i like the idea behind it but there are a few issues i hope gets fixed the app is pretty sluggish even on a nexus  absolutely no thought given to the material design guidelines and an outrageous subscription rate full review filethis inc february   hey daniel thanks for the feedback we are improving filethis constantly stay tuned the filethis team tyler hilliard august   could use a much cleaner uiux dont expect everything to be available or quickly added they have not added one of the dozen services i have suggested in over six months support is rude have been no design improvements in the time i have used it support is technically available as they have responded but shuts down any sort of suggestions and denies any bugs so pretty useless uses flash full review filethis inc september   hi tyler thanks for your feedback new updates are in the making and will be released later this

extra for the extra connections but for the past month i am having trouble looking past their many hiccups to the point that it has become unreliable as part of the service you are able to send via email any file you want to add to the account i have been having intermittent problems with this they finally fixed it and that lasted a whopping  days now i am back to having problems and there is no prompt response from the developers to address the situation when a fix did get made i only got the new files i emailed me the old ones i sent got lost that is a major problem for me today i was attempting to move files from one account to another and they simply disappeared their search function is appalling if i search for credit cards  chase i will get all my credit cards all that has a  relevant dates and all of the chase tagged items i should only be getting the items that meet all  criteria i want to love this service it is a true time saver but they still have ways to go before it becomes reliable they need to be proactive in fixing their numerous problems i would also like to have a field to add notescomments to the files excellent service worth paying for       by bindigok i love this service connects to almost all of my banks credit cards utilities insurance etc accounts and pulls the pdfs into my evernote i pay extra for more connections and its worth it i have needed easy access to statements so many times before this service it was a pain to find them on individual websites or the website no longer had older statements i can trust that all of my statements are archived in my own system i login from time to time to make sure all connections are working sometimes a bank or company will update their security settings and filethis will have to reconnect but its so easy great concept product       by aliiien i gave up on mint and mint bills after intuit essentially kept messing with them so much that theyre below par for me filethis does something ive been dying for a service to do and thats download all of the paperwork from accounts automatically this is a giant time saver and extremely useful to have as an easytoaccess backup the builtin bill pay calendar i love although i second another reviewers desire for an ical implementation the biggest downside right now is the limited companies that are available to sign in to and again per another user its be awesome to see health insurance companies be a part of this that being said its not entirely on filethis for that shortcoming customers also bought finoverafinanceview in itunes my account

service that collects online statements and makes them available to you in one place via cloud storage or locally on your computer the filethis fetch app works well with many online financial institutions such as banks and moneylenders as well as merchants and service companies whether you want to stay on top of personal finance or manage small business expenses filethis fetch might suit your needs after the installation you will be required to create a filethis account the free service allows up to six free connections statements with a paid premium option of month for  connections to create a connection just press the  icon and search for the companybankretailer that you would like to access the app currently supports more than  institutions with more on the way from popular banks such as bank of america and chase to online merchants like amazon and even utility companies like att your account info is needed plus a verification process must be passed email phone number check to start a connection the final step is to create a destination to deposit all of your digital statements you can choose from a variety of cloud services like dropbox google drive or evernote filethis fetch will then gather as many statements as it can find and converts it neatly into a pdf accessible from your destination of choice after this initial setup filethis fetch becomes mostly handsoff and will automatically fetch your documents the app performed well during our test and only had a minor hiccup when it came to amazon but that was quickly remedied by the development team syncing is almost instantaneous and filethis fetch was able to pull even the oldest statements we had available from amazon the interface is a little bland but mostly created to be functional you wont see any distracting design elements here we also hope that future updates will allow multiple destinations instead of just one the core functionality of the mobile works well with its desktop counterpart filethis fetch may be ideal for small business owners keeping track of expenses or students managing loans or just about anyone trying to stay on top of their finances   read more  explore
