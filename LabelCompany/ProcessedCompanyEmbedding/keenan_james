lp  tooledit main article tool band after moving to los angeles keenan met adam jones who had heard him singing on a demo in college impressed with keenans vocals jones suggested that they form a band although reluctant at first keenan agreed and in  tool was formed fronted by keenan the eventual lineup included guitarist jones his neighbor drummer danny carey and bassist paul damour who would later be replaced by justin chancellor keenan performing as a part of tool at s roskilde festival tool signed to zoo entertainment in november  and released the opiate ep the following year to support this release the band toured with fishbone and rage against the machine shortly thereafter tool released their  debut album undertow in the united states it was certified gold after just eight months and platinum less than a year later in  the band released their single prison sex with a corresponding music video created and directed by jones the video was deemed too graphic and offensive and was withdrawn by mtv after a few airings due to a symbolic dealing with the sensitive subject of child abuse in october  the band released their second studio album ænima the album was certified gold in ten weeks achieved double platinum in ten months and won the grammy award for best metal performance in  after the release of the album tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label volcano records formerly zoo records over contract violations following this legal battle which resulted in a new threerecord deal the members of tool decided to take some time off during the hiatus keenan went under the alias gaylord c while collaborating with tim alexander of primus and mike bordin of faith no more on choked a track on the  drumming compilation flyin traps the band members were outspokenly critical of peertopeer file sharing networks due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales during an interview with ny rock in  keenan stated i think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed the ones who get hurt by mps are not so much companies or the business but the artists people who are trying to write songs five years after the release of ænima tool announced a new album systema encéphale with a song track list in january  a month later the band revealed that the new album was actually titled lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse the album was released in may  to positive reviews known for his dark intelligent compelling and unexpected lyrical twists keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album in which he doesnt cross the line from darkness to ugliness  as often as he has in the past in an interview with ny rock keenan explained everything we release with tool is inspired by our music it doesnt matter if it is a video or if its lyrics the lyrics for schism are nothing more than my interpretation of the music the album became a worldwide success reaching no  on the us billboard  albums chart in its debut week and tool received their second grammy award for the best metal performance of  for schism in  keenan recorded a song called fallen with thirty seconds to mars that was released on the bands selftitled debut album keenan performing with tool december   in mannheim fifteen years after the bands formation tool had acquired what dan epstein of revolver described as a devoted cult following and in may  the band released  days an album in which keenan sang about more personal issues in contrast to previous attempts to inspire change his mother who inspired the song jimmy on ænima also served as the inspiration for jambi and the twopart song wings for marie and  days wings for marie pt  which deals with her  death after  years or around  days of suffering the album sold  copies in its opening week in the us and was no  on the billboard  charts however  days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor lateralus had been following  days tool has one album remaining to fulfill the obligation of its record contract though there is little information available on plans for this album the band is steadily working towards its fifth studio release tool has worked around keenan and his side projects since  starting with the creation of a perfect circle which has led to several years between projects regarding the future of tool keenan stated in a  interview with spin well make music together until one of us is dead on march   a summer tour was announced on tools website and in a march  press release tool was confirmed as a headliner for the second annual mile high music festival in commerce city colorado with widespread panic and the fray tool also headlined lollapalooza  in chicago illinois on december   tools webmaster posted on the band website something that might be encouraging to some tool enthusiasts is that while riding with danny to chili johns yesterday i heard a lot of new tool music sans maynard this was the most new material that ive heard so far although a few of the riffs and arrangements were familiar so what did i think dare i say that it sounded like tool some of it reminiscent to earlier tool stuff with other parts pushing the envelope and i assume that it will sound even more like tool once the vocal melodies etc have been added to answer your next question i cannot say how far along in the writing process the band is if i had to guess i would say more than half way and keep in mind that in the past at least the writing went faster once the first few more complex songs were finished a perfect circleedit they keep going are you working on another tool album im like a mother on a table im like giving birth to a baby and youre asking me if im going to have another baby not right now probably dont really feel like having sex right now im having a fucking baby im out here busting my ass were working hard on this this is our new child were nurturing it developing it and showing it to the world —maynard james keenan main article a perfect circle during tools postænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues keenan began working with billy howerdel tools guitar tech through the ænima tour on a different project the supergroup they formed a perfect circle began performing in  and released its first album mer de noms in  they released a successful followup in  titled thirteenth step a reference to twelvestep programs many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery both albums were eventually certified platinum their subsequent  album emotive was primarily composed of covers except for the singles counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums—a song inspired by pet that was originally released on thirteenth step—and passive keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he tested the waters and was subsequently crucified for it because of the content it was certified gold the month after its release that same year they released the dvd and cd set entitled amotion which was certified platinum within a month of its release howerdel reported in a may  interview with mtv that the supergroups work was concluded for the time being after more than two years since the bands last release keenan was asked about the status of a perfect circle during an interview with revolver he stated the real problem with running tool and a perfect circle at the same time was they both operate the same way theyre both live touring bands with a label still working under the old contract mentality so i thought it was time to let a perfect circle go for now and let billy explore himself its tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech for tool to being in a band with a pretentious famous singer and having to live in that shadow it was important for billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own and then well get back and do some a perfect circle stuff — maynard james keenan revolver december  a perfect circle performing at lollapalloza chile in  when asked in an interview for spin that same month about the possibility of another a perfect circle album keenan stated maybe someday a song on a soundtrack but an album no a year later on december   blabbermouthnet reported that keenan had announced on the pulse of radio that he and howerdel have been writing new music for a perfect circle keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume fullscale touring or even to write and record a new album instead they will focus on one or two songs at a time which will most likely be released via the internet however in november  the band returned from a nearly   ⁄year hiatus with a show tour in the western us touring resumed in may  with a north american tour across the us and canada that wrapped up at the end of august the band performed only once in  with a december  show in las vegas followed by a fiveshow australian tour and a threeshow south american tour in early  pusciferedit main article puscifer in  keenan surfaced under the name puscifer for the song rev  on the underworld film soundtrack puscifer was once advertised as a side project with danny lohner who had formerly performed live with nine inch nails but has since been formed as a manifestation of keenans creative subconscious—meaning that keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work keenan has stated that it is a premiere improvisational hardcore band and his catchall stream of consciousness anything goes etc project when comparing the project to tool in an interview with rolling stone keenan described it as his attempt to make music to inspire people  this is definitely not thinking mans music but grooveoriented music that makes you feel good in a later interview with artistdirect keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles he wanted the complexity to be in the music stating thats the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good in  puscifer contributed the song the undertaker renholder mix to the soundtrack of underworld evolution where renholder a moniker for danny lohner created by the members of a perfect circle is the reversal of re d lohner keenan financed and released the first studio album v is for vagina in october  created in a tour bus in several hotel rooms and in various studios around the country while keenan toured with tool the album is a radical departure from keenans contributions in tool and a perfect circle tim alexander best known as the drummer for rock band primus was a guest musician on the album he called puscifer trancy and hypnotic and a total  from tool the album was criticized as unfocused and lacking in the passion and intelligence present in keenans previous work puscifer is also a clothing line with merchandise available for purchase on the bands website on september   keenan updated the puscifercom blog revealing that the first ever puscifer store would be opening hopefully by october  in jerome arizona occupying a small space above a tattoo parlor the store opened on october   in addition to the merchandise available on the bands online store keenan has also made available locally roasted coffee art and limited edition collectibles on february –  keenan debuted puscifer at the pearl concert theater in palms casino resort in paradise nevada with a cabaretstyle show so abstract it is not easily described in an interview with the los angeles times keenan stated we didnt really have any clue what to call it so we just kind of called it cabaret keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment having fronted a similar show in los angeles before achieving fame with tool—went on to add that you just cant really describe it you just have to see it then it makes sense featuring an everchanging lineup of artists including milla jovovich and primus drummer tim alexander the show was originally said to have a longterm residency at the pearl however keenan later revealed that it was to be only a twoshow performance puscifer performing in  puscifer continued to perform with a revolving lineup throughout  at venues around the southwest however in a november  interview keenan stated efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the southwestern united states have been thwarted we are compelled beyond all reason to bring the noise eastward and share our special sauce although authorities suggest you be prepared for any and all possibilities we simply suggest you arrive happy and hungry on october   keenan released puscifers second album conditions of my parole the album received generally favorable reviews on metacritic a positive review from allmusics gregory heaney who described it as a fine piece of cold weather headphone music keenan followed with the february   release of donkey punch the night this ep includes covers of bohemian rhapsody by queen and balls to the wall by accept it received mostly mixed reviews resulting in a metacritic rating of  writing and performance styleedit a primary purpose of keenans lyrics for tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level to encourage them to look within themselves for selfidentity understanding and reflection tool does not include lyrics with any releases as keenan believes most people dont get it and it is not a priority of the band that people do however after each release keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semiofficial fansite with the exception of lateralus which was published on the official tool website despite maynards aversion to promoting the lyrical content of tools work to its audience lyrical arrangements are often given special attention such as in the lyrics to lateralus wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the fibonacci numbers and jambi in which the metrical foot iamb is used keenans lyrics on ænima and lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from evolution and jungian psychology in fortysix   and transcendence in lateralus in live performances with tool keenan has often been known to be situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage without a spotlight facing the backdrop rather than the audience breckinridge haggerty the bands live video director says that the dark spaces on stage are mostly for maynard he explains a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when hes trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience he needs a bit of personal space and he feels more comfortable in the shadows an exception which surprised even devout tool fans occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug keenan during the bands performance of pushit after dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss keenan continuing to sing wrapped himself around the mans back into a rear naked choke he held the man without actually constricting his neck allowing him to raise his fist in celebration keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back where he stayed for an uncomfortably long period of time his appearance with tool has included the mohawk hairstyle wigs kabuki masks bras tights and his entire body in blue paint this is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting a perfect circle describing keenans contribution to tool and a perfect circle the new york times wrote that both groups rely on mr keenans ability to dignify emotions like lust anger and disgust the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity he ranked no  in hit paraders  list of heavy metals alltime top  vocalists and his unique style of singing has often been considered influential to artists such as pete loeffler of chevelle and jared leto of thirty seconds to mars comedy and actingedit keenan is featured in several segments of mr show most notably in the ronnie dobbs sketch presented in the first season in one scene he is seen being arrested with dobbs later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the thenfictitious band puscifer when asked about the arrest of dobbs keenan replies guilty yeah im

a famous life magazine portrait he also appeared as satan in the  film bikini bandits and its  sequel bikini bandits  golden rod when asked in an interview which role was more difficult keenan responded oh manson hes a real person people know what he looks like how he talked with satan theres so much gray area in the mids responding to requests for tool to perform in benefit shows keenan created free frances bean teeshirts to represent his own platform frances mother courtney love had previously referred to keenan as a media whore to which he responded isnt that great i have the distinction of being called a media whore by courtney love he said that after watching the tornado that is her mother he thought oh my god how is frances bean gonna survive this insanity although it was started as a simple joke the tshirts were soon in high demand and keenan was giving them away on april   the official tool website announced as an april fools day prank that maynard has found jesus and would be abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently kurt loder of mtv contacted keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation when loder asked again keenans response was simply heh heh on april  the official site revealed that it was a hoax during an interview keenan later stated it was april fools if you fall for that on april fools day theres nothing i can do for you he has been part of other april fools pranks related to tool including one in which he was said to be in critical condition after a tour bus

in michigan keenan considers this the best move he ever made maynard graduated in the class of  at mason county central high school in scottville where he was a member of the wrestling team his father

opiate ep the following year to support this release the band toured with fishbone and rage against the machine shortly thereafter tool released their  debut album undertow in the united states it was certified gold after just eight months and platinum less than a year later in  the band released their single prison sex with a corresponding music video created and directed by jones the video was deemed too graphic and offensive and was withdrawn by mtv after a few airings due to a symbolic dealing with the sensitive subject of child abuse in october  the band released their second studio album ænima the album was certified gold in ten weeks achieved double platinum in ten months and won the grammy award for best metal performance in  after the release of the album tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label volcano records formerly zoo records over contract violations following this legal battle which resulted in a new threerecord deal the members of tool decided to take some time off during the hiatus keenan went under the alias gaylord c while collaborating with tim alexander of primus and mike bordin of faith no more on choked a track on the  drumming compilation flyin traps the band members were outspokenly critical of peertopeer file sharing networks due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales during an interview with ny rock in  keenan stated i think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed the ones who get hurt by mps are not so much companies or the business but the artists people who are trying to write songs five years after the release of ænima tool announced a new album systema encéphale with a song track list in january  a month later the band revealed that the new album was actually titled lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse the album was released in may  to positive reviews known for his dark intelligent compelling and unexpected lyrical twists keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album in which he doesnt cross the line from darkness to ugliness  as often as he has in the past in an interview with ny rock keenan explained everything we release with tool is inspired by our music it doesnt matter if it is a video or if its lyrics the lyrics for schism are nothing more than my interpretation of the music the album became a worldwide success reaching no  on the us billboard  albums chart in its debut week and tool received their second grammy award for the best metal performance of  for schism in  keenan recorded a song called fallen with thirty seconds to mars that was released on the bands selftitled debut album keenan performing with tool december   in mannheim fifteen years after the bands formation tool had acquired what dan epstein of revolver described as a devoted cult following and in may  the band released  days an album in which keenan sang about more personal issues in contrast to previous attempts to inspire change his mother who inspired the song jimmy on ænima also served as the inspiration for jambi and the twopart song wings for marie and  days wings for marie pt  which deals with her  death after  years or around  days of suffering the album sold  copies in its opening week in the us and was no  on the billboard  charts however  days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor lateralus had been following  days tool has one album remaining to fulfill the obligation of its record contract though there is little information available on plans for this album the band is steadily working towards its fifth studio release tool has worked around keenan and his side projects since  starting with the creation of a perfect circle which has led to several years between projects regarding the future of tool keenan stated in a  interview with spin well make music together until one of us is dead on march   a summer tour was announced on tools website and in a march  press release tool was confirmed as a headliner for the second annual mile high music festival in commerce city colorado with widespread panic and the fray tool also headlined lollapalooza  in chicago illinois on december   tools webmaster posted on the band website something that might be encouraging to some tool enthusiasts is that while riding with danny to chili johns yesterday i heard a lot of new tool music sans maynard this was the most new material that ive heard so far although a few of the riffs and arrangements were familiar so what did i think dare i say that it sounded like tool some of it reminiscent to earlier tool stuff with other parts pushing the envelope and i assume that it will sound even more like tool once the vocal melodies etc have been added to answer your next question i cannot say how far along in the writing process the band is if i had to guess i would say more than half way and keep in mind that in the past at least the writing went faster once the first few more complex songs were finished a perfect circleedit they keep going are you working on another tool album im like a mother on a table im like giving birth to a baby and youre asking me if im going to have another baby not right now probably dont really feel like having sex right now im having a fucking baby im out here busting my ass were working hard on this this is our new child were nurturing it developing it and showing it to the world —maynard james keenan main article a perfect circle during tools postænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues keenan began working with billy howerdel tools guitar tech through the ænima tour on a different project the supergroup they formed a perfect circle began performing in  and released its first album mer de noms in  they released a successful followup in  titled thirteenth step a reference to twelvestep programs many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery both albums were eventually certified platinum their subsequent  album emotive was primarily composed of covers except for the singles counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums—a song inspired by pet that was originally released on thirteenth step—and passive keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he tested the waters and was subsequently crucified for it because of the content it was certified gold the month after its release that same year they released the dvd and cd set entitled amotion which was certified platinum within a month of its release howerdel reported in a may  interview with mtv that the supergroups work was concluded for the time being after more than two years since the bands last release keenan was asked about the status of a perfect circle during an interview with revolver he stated the real problem with running tool and a perfect circle at the same time was they both operate the same way theyre both live touring bands with a label still working under the old contract mentality so i thought it was time to let a perfect circle go for now and let billy explore himself its tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech for tool to being in a band with a pretentious famous singer and having to live in that shadow it was important for billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own and then well get back and do some a perfect circle stuff — maynard james keenan revolver december  a perfect circle performing at lollapalloza chile in  when asked in an interview for spin that same month about the possibility of another a perfect circle album keenan stated maybe someday a song on a soundtrack but an album no a year later on december   blabbermouthnet reported that keenan had announced on the pulse of radio that he and howerdel have been writing new music for a perfect circle keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume fullscale touring or even to write and record a new album instead they will focus on one or two songs at a time which will most likely be released via the internet however in november  the band returned from a nearly   ⁄year hiatus with a show tour in the western us touring resumed in may  with a north american tour across the us and canada that wrapped up at the end of august the band performed only once in  with a december  show in las vegas followed by a fiveshow australian tour and a threeshow south american tour in early  pusciferedit main article puscifer in  keenan surfaced under the name puscifer for the song rev  on the underworld film soundtrack puscifer was once advertised as a side project with danny lohner who had formerly performed live with nine inch nails but has since been formed as a manifestation of keenans creative subconscious—meaning that keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work keenan has stated that it is a premiere improvisational hardcore band and his catchall stream of consciousness anything goes etc project when comparing the project to tool in an interview with rolling stone keenan described it as his attempt to make music to inspire people  this is definitely not thinking mans music but grooveoriented music that makes you feel good in a later interview with artistdirect keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles he wanted the complexity to be in the music stating thats the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good in  puscifer contributed the song the undertaker renholder mix to the soundtrack of underworld evolution where renholder a moniker for danny lohner created by the members of a perfect circle is the reversal of re d lohner keenan financed and released the first studio album v is for vagina in october  created in a tour bus in several hotel rooms and in various studios around the country while keenan toured with tool the album is a radical departure from keenans contributions in tool and a perfect circle tim alexander best known as the drummer for rock band primus was a guest musician on the album he called puscifer trancy and hypnotic and a total  from tool the album was criticized as unfocused and lacking in the passion and intelligence present in keenans previous work puscifer is also a clothing line with merchandise available for purchase on the bands website on september   keenan updated the puscifercom blog revealing that the first ever puscifer store would be opening hopefully by october  in jerome arizona occupying a small space above a tattoo parlor the store opened on october   in addition to the merchandise available on the bands online store keenan has also made available locally roasted coffee art and limited edition collectibles on february –  keenan debuted puscifer at the pearl concert theater in palms casino resort in paradise nevada with a cabaretstyle show so abstract it is not easily described in an interview with the los angeles times keenan stated we didnt really have any clue what to call it so we just kind of called it cabaret keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment having fronted a similar show in los angeles before achieving fame with tool—went on to add that you just cant really describe it you just have to see it then it makes sense featuring an everchanging lineup of artists including milla jovovich and primus drummer tim alexander the show was originally said to have a longterm residency at the pearl however keenan later revealed that it was to be only a twoshow performance puscifer performing in  puscifer continued to perform with a revolving lineup throughout  at venues around the southwest however in a november  interview keenan stated efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the southwestern united states have been thwarted we are compelled beyond all reason to bring the noise eastward and share our special sauce although authorities suggest you be prepared for any and all possibilities we simply suggest you arrive happy and hungry on october   keenan released puscifers second album conditions of my parole the album received generally favorable reviews on metacritic a positive review from allmusics gregory heaney who described it as a fine piece of cold weather headphone music keenan followed with the february   release of donkey punch the night this ep includes covers of bohemian rhapsody by queen and balls to the wall by accept it received mostly mixed reviews resulting in a metacritic rating of  writing and performance styleedit a primary purpose of keenans lyrics for tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level to encourage them to look within themselves for selfidentity understanding and reflection tool does not include lyrics with any releases as keenan believes most people dont get it and it is not a priority of the band that people do however after each release keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semiofficial fansite with the exception of lateralus which was published on the official tool website despite maynards aversion to promoting the lyrical content of tools work to its audience lyrical arrangements are often given special attention such as in the lyrics to lateralus wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the fibonacci numbers and jambi in which the metrical foot iamb is used keenans lyrics on ænima and lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from evolution and jungian psychology in fortysix   and transcendence in lateralus in live performances with tool keenan has often been known to be situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage without a spotlight facing the backdrop rather than the audience breckinridge haggerty the bands live video director says that the dark spaces on stage are mostly for maynard he explains a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when hes trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience he needs a bit of personal space and he feels more comfortable in the shadows an exception which surprised even devout tool fans occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug keenan during the bands performance of pushit after dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss keenan continuing to sing wrapped himself around the mans back into a rear naked choke he held the man without actually constricting his neck allowing him to raise his fist in celebration keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back where he stayed for an uncomfortably long period of time his appearance with tool has included the mohawk hairstyle wigs kabuki masks bras tights and his entire body in blue paint this is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting a perfect circle describing keenans contribution to tool and a perfect circle the new york times wrote that both groups rely on mr keenans ability to dignify emotions like lust anger and disgust the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity he ranked no  in hit paraders  list of heavy metals alltime top  vocalists and his unique style of singing has often been considered influential to artists such as pete loeffler of chevelle and jared leto of thirty seconds to mars comedy and actingedit keenan is featured in several segments of mr show most notably in the ronnie dobbs sketch presented in the first season in one scene he is seen being arrested with dobbs later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the thenfictitious band

arrangements were familiar so what did i think dare i say that it sounded like tool some of it reminiscent to earlier tool stuff with other parts pushing the envelope and i assume that it will sound even more like tool once the vocal melodies etc have been added to answer your next question i cannot say how far along in the writing process the band is if i had to guess i would say more than half way and keep in mind that in the past at least the writing went faster once the first few more complex songs were finished a perfect circleedit they keep going are you working on another tool album im like a mother on a table im like giving birth to a baby and youre asking me if im going to have another baby not right now probably dont really feel like having sex right now im having a fucking baby im out here busting my ass were working hard on this this is our new child were nurturing it developing it and showing it to the world —maynard james keenan main article a perfect circle during tools postænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues keenan began working with billy howerdel tools guitar tech through the ænima tour on a different project the supergroup they formed a perfect circle began performing in  and released its first album mer de noms in  they released a successful followup in  titled thirteenth step a reference to twelvestep programs many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery both albums were eventually certified platinum their subsequent  album emotive was primarily composed of covers except for the singles counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums—a song inspired by pet that was originally released on thirteenth step—and passive keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he tested the waters and was subsequently crucified for it because of the content it was certified gold the month after its release that same year they released the dvd and cd set entitled amotion which was certified platinum within a month of its release howerdel reported in a may  interview with mtv that the supergroups work was concluded for the time being after more than two years since the bands last release keenan was asked about the status of a perfect circle during an interview with revolver he stated the real problem with running tool and a perfect circle at the same time was they both operate the same way theyre both live touring bands with a label still working under the old contract mentality so i thought it was time to let a perfect circle go for now and let billy explore himself its tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech for tool to being in a band with a pretentious famous singer and having to live in that shadow it was important for billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own and then well get back and do some a perfect circle stuff — maynard james keenan revolver december  a perfect circle performing at lollapalloza chile in  when asked in an interview for spin that same month about the possibility of another a perfect circle album keenan stated maybe someday a song on a soundtrack but an album no a year later on december   blabbermouthnet reported that keenan had announced on the pulse of radio that he and howerdel have been writing new music for a perfect circle keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume fullscale touring or even to write and record a new album instead they will focus on one or two songs at a time which will most likely be released via the internet however in november  the band returned from a nearly   ⁄year hiatus with a show tour in the western us touring resumed in may  with a north american tour across the us and canada that wrapped up at the end of august the band performed only once in  with a december  show in las vegas followed by a fiveshow australian tour and a threeshow south american tour in early  pusciferedit main article puscifer in  keenan surfaced under the name puscifer for the song rev  on the underworld film soundtrack puscifer was once advertised as a side project with danny lohner who had formerly performed live with nine inch nails but has since been formed as a manifestation of keenans creative subconscious—meaning that keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work keenan has stated that it is a premiere improvisational hardcore band and his catchall stream of consciousness anything goes etc project when comparing the project to tool in an interview with rolling stone keenan described it as his attempt to make music to inspire people  this is definitely not thinking mans music but grooveoriented music that makes you feel good in a later interview with artistdirect keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles he wanted the complexity to be in the music stating thats the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good in  puscifer contributed the song the undertaker renholder mix to the soundtrack of underworld evolution where renholder a moniker for danny lohner created by the members of a perfect circle is the reversal of re d lohner keenan financed and released the first studio album v is for vagina in october  created in a tour bus in several hotel rooms and in various studios around the country while keenan toured with tool the album is a radical departure from keenans contributions in tool and a perfect circle tim alexander best known as the drummer for rock band primus was a guest musician on the album he called puscifer trancy and hypnotic and a total  from tool the album was criticized as unfocused and lacking in the passion and intelligence present in keenans previous work puscifer is also a clothing line with merchandise available for purchase on the bands website on september   keenan updated the puscifercom blog revealing that the first ever puscifer store would be opening hopefully by october  in jerome arizona occupying a small space above a tattoo parlor the store opened on october   in addition to the merchandise available on the bands online store keenan has also made available locally roasted coffee art and limited edition collectibles on february –  keenan debuted puscifer at the pearl concert theater in palms casino resort in paradise nevada with a cabaretstyle show so abstract it is not easily described in an interview with the los angeles times keenan stated we didnt really have any clue what to call it so we just kind of called it cabaret keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment having fronted a similar show in los angeles before achieving fame with tool—went on to add that you just cant really describe it you just have to see it then it makes sense featuring an everchanging lineup of artists including milla jovovich and primus drummer tim alexander the show was originally said to have a longterm residency at the pearl however keenan later revealed that it was to be only a twoshow performance puscifer performing in  puscifer continued to perform with a revolving lineup throughout  at venues around the southwest however in a november  interview keenan stated efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the southwestern united states have been thwarted we are compelled beyond all reason to bring the noise eastward and share our special sauce although authorities suggest you be prepared for any and all possibilities we simply suggest you arrive happy and hungry on october   keenan released puscifers second album conditions of my parole the album received generally favorable reviews on metacritic a positive review from allmusics gregory heaney who described it as a fine piece of cold weather headphone music keenan followed with the february   release of donkey punch the night this ep includes covers of bohemian rhapsody by queen and balls to the wall by accept it received mostly mixed reviews resulting in a metacritic rating of  writing and performance styleedit a primary purpose of keenans lyrics for tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level to encourage them to look within themselves for selfidentity understanding and reflection tool does not include lyrics with any releases as keenan believes most people dont get it and it is not a priority of the band that people do however after each release keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semiofficial fansite with the exception of lateralus which was published on the official tool website despite maynards aversion to promoting the lyrical content of tools work to its audience lyrical arrangements are often given special attention such as in the lyrics to lateralus wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the fibonacci numbers and jambi in which the metrical foot iamb is used keenans lyrics on ænima and lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from evolution and jungian psychology in fortysix   and transcendence in lateralus in live performances with tool keenan has often been known to be situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage without a spotlight facing the backdrop rather than the audience breckinridge haggerty the bands live video director says that the dark spaces on stage are mostly for maynard he explains a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when hes trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience he needs a bit of personal space and he feels more comfortable in the shadows an exception which surprised even devout tool fans occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug keenan during the bands performance of pushit after dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss keenan continuing to sing wrapped himself around the mans back into a rear naked choke he held the man without actually constricting his neck allowing him to raise his fist in celebration keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back where he stayed for an uncomfortably long period of time his appearance with tool has included the mohawk hairstyle wigs kabuki masks bras tights and his entire body in blue paint this is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting a perfect circle describing keenans contribution to tool and a perfect circle the new york times wrote that both groups rely on mr keenans ability to dignify emotions like lust anger and disgust the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity he ranked no  in hit paraders  list of heavy metals alltime top  vocalists and his unique style of singing has often been considered influential to artists such as pete loeffler of chevelle and jared leto of thirty seconds to mars comedy and actingedit keenan is featured in several segments of mr show most notably in the ronnie dobbs sketch presented in the first season in one scene he is seen being arrested with dobbs later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the thenfictitious band

pop smear magazine portraying charles manson as part of a photo essay imitating a famous life magazine portrait he also appeared as satan in the  film bikini bandits and its  sequel bikini bandits  golden rod when asked in an interview which role was more difficult keenan responded oh manson hes a real person people know what he looks like how he talked with satan theres so much gray area in the mids responding to requests for tool to perform in benefit shows keenan created free frances bean teeshirts to represent his own platform frances mother courtney love had previously referred to keenan as a media whore to which he responded isnt that great i have the distinction of being called a media whore by courtney love he said that after watching the tornado that is her mother he thought oh my god how is frances bean gonna survive this insanity although it was started as a simple joke the tshirts were soon in high demand and keenan was giving them away on april   the official tool website announced as an april fools day prank that maynard has found jesus and would be abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently kurt loder of mtv contacted keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation when loder asked again keenans response was simply heh heh on april  the official site revealed that it was a hoax during an interview keenan later stated it was april fools if you fall for that on april fools day theres nothing i can do for you he has been part of other april fools pranks related to tool including one in

more on choked a track on the  drumming compilation flyin traps the band members were outspokenly critical of peertopeer file sharing networks due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales during an interview with ny rock in  keenan stated i think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed the ones who get hurt by mps are not so much companies or the business but the artists people who are trying to write songs five years after the release of ænima tool announced a new album systema encéphale with a song track list in january  a month later the band revealed that the new album was actually titled lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse the album was released in may  to positive reviews known for his dark intelligent compelling and unexpected lyrical twists keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album in which he doesnt cross the line from darkness to ugliness  as often as he has in the past in an interview with ny rock keenan explained everything we release with tool is inspired by our music it doesnt matter if it is a video or if its lyrics the lyrics for schism are nothing more than my interpretation of the music the album became a worldwide success reaching no  on the us billboard  albums chart in its debut week and tool received their second grammy award for the best metal performance of  for schism in  keenan recorded a song called fallen with thirty seconds to mars that was released on the bands selftitled debut album keenan performing with tool december   in mannheim fifteen years after the bands formation tool had acquired what dan epstein of revolver described as a devoted cult following and in may  the band released  days an album in which keenan sang about more personal issues in contrast to previous attempts to inspire change his mother who inspired the song jimmy on ænima also served as the inspiration for jambi and the twopart song wings for marie and  days wings for marie pt  which deals with her  death after  years or around  days of suffering the album sold  copies in its opening week in the us and was no  on the billboard  charts however  days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor lateralus had been following  days tool has one album remaining to fulfill the obligation of its record contract though there is little information available on plans for this album the band is steadily working towards its fifth studio release tool has worked around keenan and his side projects since  starting with the creation of a perfect circle which has led to several years between projects regarding the future of tool keenan stated in a  interview with spin well make music together until one of us is dead on march   a summer tour was announced on tools website and in a march  press release tool was confirmed as a headliner for the second annual mile high music festival in commerce city colorado with widespread panic and the fray tool also headlined lollapalooza  in chicago illinois on december   tools webmaster posted on the band website something that might be encouraging to some tool enthusiasts is that while riding with danny to chili johns yesterday i heard a lot of new tool music sans maynard this was the most new material that ive heard so far although a few of the riffs and arrangements were familiar so what did i think dare i say that it sounded like tool some of it reminiscent to earlier tool stuff with other parts pushing the envelope and i assume that it will sound even more like tool once the vocal melodies etc have been added to answer your next question i cannot say how far along in the writing process the band is if i had to guess i would say more than half way and keep in mind that in the past at least the writing went faster once the first few more complex songs were finished a perfect circleedit they keep going are you working on another tool album im like a mother on a table im like giving birth to a baby and youre asking me if im going to have another baby not right now probably dont really feel like having sex right now im having a fucking baby im out here busting my ass were working hard on this this is our new child were nurturing it developing it and showing it to the world —maynard james keenan main article a perfect circle during tools postænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues keenan began working with billy howerdel tools guitar tech through the ænima tour on a different project the supergroup they formed a perfect circle began performing in  and released its first album mer de noms in  they released a successful followup in  titled thirteenth step a reference to twelvestep programs many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery both albums were eventually certified platinum their subsequent  album emotive was primarily composed of covers except for the singles counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums—a song inspired by pet that was originally released on thirteenth step—and passive keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he tested the waters and was subsequently crucified for it because of the content it was certified gold the month after its release that same year they released the dvd and cd set entitled amotion which was certified platinum within a month of its release howerdel reported in a may  interview with mtv that the supergroups work was concluded for the time being after more than two years since the bands last release keenan was asked about the status of a perfect circle during an interview with revolver he stated the real problem with running tool and a perfect circle at the same time was they both operate the same way theyre both live touring bands with a label still working under the old contract mentality so i thought it was time to let a perfect circle go for now and let billy explore himself its tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech for tool to being in a band with a pretentious famous singer and having to live in that shadow it was important for billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own and then well get back and do some a perfect circle stuff — maynard james keenan revolver december  a perfect circle performing at lollapalloza chile in  when asked in an interview for spin that same month about the possibility of another a perfect circle album keenan stated maybe someday a song on a soundtrack but an album no a year later on december   blabbermouthnet reported that keenan had announced on the pulse of radio that he and howerdel have been writing new music for a perfect circle keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume fullscale touring or even to write and record a new album instead they will focus on one or two songs at a time which will most likely be released via the internet however in november  the band returned from a nearly   ⁄year hiatus with a show tour in the western us touring resumed in may  with a north american tour across the us and canada that wrapped up at the end of august the band performed only once in  with a december  show in las vegas followed by a fiveshow australian tour and a threeshow south american tour in early  pusciferedit main article puscifer in  keenan surfaced under the name puscifer for the song rev  on the underworld film soundtrack puscifer was once advertised as a side project with danny lohner who had formerly performed live with nine inch nails but has since been formed as a manifestation of keenans creative subconscious—meaning that keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work keenan has stated that it is a premiere improvisational hardcore band and his catchall stream of consciousness anything goes etc project when comparing the project to tool in an interview with rolling stone keenan described it as his attempt to make music to inspire people  this is definitely not thinking mans music but grooveoriented music that makes you feel good in a later interview with artistdirect keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles he wanted the complexity to be in the music stating thats the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good in  puscifer contributed the song the undertaker renholder mix to the soundtrack of underworld evolution where renholder a moniker for danny lohner created by the members of a perfect circle is the reversal of re d lohner keenan financed and released the first studio album v is for vagina in october  created in a tour bus in several hotel rooms and in various studios around the country while keenan toured with tool the album is a radical departure from keenans contributions in tool and a perfect circle tim alexander best known as the drummer for rock band primus was a guest musician on the album he called puscifer trancy and hypnotic and a total  from tool the album was criticized as unfocused and lacking in the passion and intelligence present in keenans previous work puscifer is also a clothing line with merchandise available for purchase on the bands website on september   keenan updated the puscifercom blog revealing that the first ever puscifer store would be opening hopefully by october  in jerome arizona occupying a small space above a tattoo parlor the store opened on october   in addition to the merchandise available on the bands online store keenan has also made available locally roasted coffee art and limited edition collectibles on february –  keenan debuted puscifer at the pearl concert theater in palms casino resort in paradise nevada with a cabaretstyle show so abstract it is not easily described in an interview with the los angeles times keenan stated we didnt really have any clue what to call it so we just kind of called it cabaret keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment having fronted a similar show in los angeles before achieving fame with tool—went on to add that you just cant really describe it you just have to see it then it makes sense featuring an everchanging lineup of artists including milla jovovich and primus drummer tim alexander the show was originally said to have a longterm residency at the pearl however keenan later revealed that it was to be only a twoshow performance puscifer performing in  puscifer continued to perform with a revolving lineup throughout  at venues around the southwest however in a november  interview keenan stated efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the southwestern united states have been thwarted we are compelled beyond all reason to bring the noise eastward and share our special sauce although authorities suggest you be prepared for any and all possibilities we simply suggest you arrive happy and hungry on october   keenan released puscifers second album conditions of my parole the album received generally favorable reviews on metacritic a positive review from allmusics gregory heaney who described it as a fine piece of cold weather headphone music keenan followed with the february   release of donkey punch the night this ep includes covers of bohemian rhapsody by queen and balls to the wall by accept it received mostly mixed reviews resulting in a metacritic rating of  writing and performance styleedit a primary purpose of keenans lyrics for tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level to encourage them to look within themselves for selfidentity understanding and reflection tool does not include lyrics with any releases as keenan believes most people dont get it and it is not a priority of the band that people do however after each release keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semiofficial fansite with the exception of lateralus which was published on the official tool website despite maynards aversion to promoting the lyrical content of tools work to its audience lyrical arrangements are often given special attention such as in the lyrics to lateralus wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the fibonacci numbers and jambi in which the metrical foot iamb is used keenans lyrics on ænima and lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from evolution and jungian psychology in fortysix   and transcendence in lateralus in live performances with tool keenan has often been known to be situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage without a spotlight facing the backdrop rather than the audience breckinridge haggerty the bands live video director says that the dark spaces on stage are mostly for maynard he explains a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when hes trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience he needs a bit of personal space and he feels more comfortable in the shadows an exception which surprised even devout tool fans occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug keenan during the bands performance of pushit after dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss keenan continuing to sing wrapped himself around the mans back into a rear naked choke he held the man without actually constricting his neck allowing him to raise his fist in celebration keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back where he stayed for an uncomfortably long period of time his appearance with tool has included the mohawk hairstyle wigs kabuki masks bras tights and his entire body in blue paint this is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting a perfect circle describing keenans contribution to tool and a perfect circle the new york times wrote that both groups rely on mr keenans ability to dignify emotions like lust anger and disgust the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity he ranked no  in hit paraders  list of heavy metals alltime top  vocalists and his unique style of singing has often been considered influential to artists such as pete loeffler of chevelle and jared leto of thirty seconds to mars comedy and actingedit keenan is featured in several segments of mr show most notably in the

mids responding to requests for tool to perform in benefit shows keenan created free frances bean teeshirts to represent his own platform frances mother courtney love had previously referred to keenan as a media whore to which he responded isnt that great i have the distinction of being called a media whore by courtney love he said that after watching the tornado that is her mother he thought oh my god how is frances bean gonna survive this insanity although it was started as a simple joke the tshirts were soon in high demand and keenan was giving them away on april   the official tool website announced as an april fools day prank that maynard has found jesus and would be abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently kurt loder of mtv contacted keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation when loder asked again keenans response was simply heh heh on april  the official site revealed that it was a hoax during an interview keenan later stated it was april fools if you fall for that on april fools day theres nothing i can do for you he has been part of other april fools pranks related to tool including one in

debut album undertow in the united states it was certified gold after just eight months and platinum less than a year later in  the band released their single prison sex with a corresponding music video created and directed by jones the video was deemed too graphic and offensive and was withdrawn by mtv after a few airings due to a symbolic dealing with the sensitive subject of child abuse in october  the band released their second studio album ænima the album was certified gold in ten weeks achieved double platinum in ten months and won the grammy award for best metal performance in  after the release of the album tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label volcano records formerly zoo records over contract violations following this legal battle which resulted in a new threerecord deal the members of tool decided to take some time off during the hiatus keenan went under the alias gaylord c while collaborating with tim alexander of primus and mike bordin of faith no more on choked a track on the  drumming compilation flyin traps the band members were outspokenly critical of peertopeer file sharing networks due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales during an interview with ny rock in  keenan stated i think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed the ones who get hurt by mps are not so much companies or the business but the artists people who are trying to write songs five years after the release of ænima tool announced a new album systema encéphale with a song track list in january  a month later the band revealed that the new album was actually titled lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse the album was released in may  to positive reviews known for his dark intelligent compelling and unexpected lyrical twists keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album in which he doesnt cross the line from darkness to ugliness  as often as he has in the past in an interview with ny rock keenan explained everything we release with tool is inspired by our music it doesnt matter if it is a video or if its lyrics the lyrics for schism are nothing more than my interpretation of the music the album became a worldwide success reaching no  on the us billboard  albums chart in its debut week and tool received their second grammy award for the best metal performance of  for schism in  keenan recorded a song called fallen with thirty seconds to mars that was released on the bands selftitled debut album keenan performing with tool december   in mannheim fifteen years after the bands formation tool had acquired what dan epstein of revolver described as a devoted cult following and in may  the band released  days an album in which keenan sang about more personal issues in contrast to previous attempts to inspire change his mother who inspired the song jimmy on ænima also served as the inspiration for jambi and the twopart song wings for marie and  days wings for marie pt  which deals with her  death after  years or around  days of suffering the album sold  copies in its opening week in the us and was no  on the billboard  charts however  days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor lateralus had been following  days tool has one album remaining to fulfill the obligation of its record contract though there is little information available on plans for this album the band is steadily working towards its fifth studio release tool has worked around keenan and his side projects since  starting with the creation of a perfect circle which has led to several years between projects regarding the future of tool keenan stated in a  interview with spin well make music together until one of us is dead on march   a summer tour was announced on tools website and in a march  press release tool was confirmed as a headliner for the second annual mile high music festival in commerce city colorado with widespread panic and the fray tool also headlined lollapalooza  in chicago illinois on december   tools webmaster posted on the band website something that might be encouraging to some tool enthusiasts is that while riding with danny to chili johns yesterday i heard a lot of new tool music sans maynard this was the most new material that ive heard so far although a few of the riffs and arrangements were familiar so what did i think dare i say that it sounded like tool some of it reminiscent to earlier tool stuff with other parts pushing the envelope and i assume that it will sound even more like tool once the vocal melodies etc have been added to answer your next question i cannot say how far along in the writing process the band is if i had to guess i would say more than half way and keep in mind that in the past at least the writing went faster once the first few more complex songs were finished a perfect circleedit they keep going are you working on another tool album im like a mother on a table im like giving birth to a baby and youre asking me if im going to have another baby not right now probably dont really feel like having sex right now im having a fucking baby im out here busting my ass were working hard on this this is our new child were nurturing it developing it and showing it to the world —maynard james keenan main article a perfect circle during tools postænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues keenan began working with billy howerdel tools guitar tech through the ænima tour on a different project the supergroup they formed a perfect circle began performing in  and released its first album mer de noms in  they released a successful followup in  titled thirteenth step a reference to twelvestep programs many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery both albums were eventually certified platinum their subsequent  album emotive was primarily composed of covers except for the singles counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums—a song inspired by pet that was originally released on thirteenth step—and passive keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he tested the waters and was subsequently crucified for it because of the content it was certified gold the month after its release that same year they released the dvd and cd set entitled amotion which was certified platinum within a month of its release howerdel reported in a may  interview with mtv that the supergroups work was concluded for the time being after more than two years since the bands last release keenan was asked about the status of a perfect circle during an interview with revolver he stated the real problem with running tool and a perfect circle at the same time was they both operate the same way theyre both live touring bands with a label still working under the old contract mentality so i thought it was time to let a perfect circle go for now and let billy explore himself its tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech for tool to being in a band with a pretentious famous singer and having to live in that shadow it was important for billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own and then well get back and do some a perfect circle stuff — maynard james keenan revolver december  a perfect circle performing at lollapalloza chile in  when asked in an interview for spin that same month about the possibility of another a perfect circle album keenan stated maybe someday a song on a soundtrack but an album no a year later on december   blabbermouthnet reported that keenan had announced on the pulse of radio that he and howerdel have been writing new music for a perfect circle keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume fullscale touring or even to write and record a new album instead they will focus on one or two songs at a time which will most likely be released via the internet however in november  the band returned from a nearly   ⁄year hiatus with a show tour in the western us touring resumed in may  with a north american tour across the us and canada that wrapped up at the end of august the band performed only once in  with a december  show in las vegas followed by a fiveshow australian tour and a threeshow south american tour in early  pusciferedit main article puscifer in  keenan surfaced under the name puscifer for the song rev  on the underworld film soundtrack puscifer was once advertised as a side project with danny lohner who had formerly performed live with nine inch nails but has since been formed as a manifestation of keenans creative subconscious—meaning that keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work keenan has stated that it is a premiere improvisational hardcore band and his catchall stream of consciousness anything goes etc project when comparing the project to tool in an interview with rolling stone keenan described it as his attempt to make music to inspire people  this is definitely not thinking mans music but grooveoriented music that makes you feel good in a later interview with artistdirect keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles he wanted the complexity to be in the music stating thats the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good in  puscifer contributed the song the undertaker renholder mix to the soundtrack of underworld evolution where renholder a moniker for danny lohner created by the members of a perfect circle is the reversal of re d lohner keenan financed and released the first studio album v is for vagina in october  created in a tour bus in several hotel rooms and in various studios around the country while keenan toured with tool the album is a radical departure from keenans contributions in tool and a perfect circle tim alexander best known as the drummer for rock band primus was a guest musician on the album he called puscifer trancy and hypnotic and a total  from tool the album was criticized as unfocused and lacking in the passion and intelligence present in keenans previous work puscifer is also a clothing line with merchandise available for purchase on the bands website on september   keenan updated the puscifercom blog revealing that the first ever puscifer store would be opening hopefully by october  in jerome arizona occupying a small space above a tattoo parlor the store opened on october   in addition to the merchandise available on the bands online store keenan has also made available locally roasted coffee art and limited edition collectibles on february –  keenan debuted puscifer at the pearl concert theater in palms casino resort in paradise nevada with a cabaretstyle show so abstract it is not easily described in an interview with the los angeles times keenan stated we didnt really have any clue what to call it so we just kind of called it cabaret keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment having fronted a similar show in los angeles before achieving fame with tool—went on to add that you just cant really describe it you just have to see it then it makes sense featuring an everchanging lineup of artists including milla jovovich and primus drummer tim alexander the show was originally said to have a longterm residency at the pearl however keenan later revealed that it was to be only a twoshow performance puscifer performing in  puscifer continued to perform with a revolving lineup throughout  at venues around the southwest however in a november  interview keenan stated efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the southwestern united states have been thwarted we are compelled beyond all reason to bring the noise eastward and share our special sauce although authorities suggest you be prepared for any and all possibilities we simply suggest you arrive happy and hungry on october   keenan released puscifers second album conditions of my parole the album received generally favorable reviews on metacritic a positive review from allmusics gregory heaney who described it as a fine piece of cold weather headphone music keenan followed with the february   release of donkey punch the night this ep includes covers of bohemian rhapsody by queen and balls to the wall by accept it received mostly mixed reviews resulting in a metacritic rating of  writing and performance styleedit a primary purpose of keenans lyrics for tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level to encourage them to look within themselves for selfidentity understanding and reflection tool does not include lyrics with any releases as keenan believes most people dont get it and it is not a priority of the band that people do however after each release keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semiofficial fansite with the exception of lateralus which was published on the official tool website despite maynards aversion to promoting the lyrical content of tools work to its audience lyrical arrangements are often given special attention such as in the lyrics to lateralus wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the fibonacci numbers and jambi in which the metrical foot iamb is used keenans lyrics on ænima and lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from evolution and jungian psychology in fortysix   and transcendence in lateralus in live performances with tool keenan has often been known to be situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage without a spotlight facing the backdrop rather than the audience breckinridge haggerty the bands live video director says that the dark spaces on stage are mostly for maynard he explains a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when hes trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience he needs a bit of personal space and he feels more comfortable in the shadows an exception which surprised even devout tool fans occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug keenan during the bands performance of pushit after dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss keenan continuing to sing wrapped himself around the mans back into a rear naked choke he held the man without actually constricting his neck allowing him to raise his fist in celebration keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back where he stayed for an uncomfortably long period of time his appearance with tool has included the mohawk hairstyle wigs kabuki masks bras tights and his entire body in blue paint this is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting a perfect circle describing keenans contribution to tool and a perfect circle the new york times wrote that both groups rely on mr keenans ability to dignify emotions like lust anger and disgust the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity he ranked no  in hit paraders  list of heavy metals alltime top  vocalists and his unique style of singing has often been considered influential to artists such as pete loeffler of chevelle and jared leto of thirty seconds to mars comedy and actingedit keenan is featured in several segments of mr show most notably in the ronnie dobbs sketch presented in the first season in one scene he is seen being arrested with dobbs later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the thenfictitious band puscifer when asked about the arrest of dobbs keenan replies guilty yeah im sure hes guilty but he knows it i mean youre guilty and you dont know it so whos really in jail he also appears in episode  the velveteen touch of a dandy fop as one of the viewers of coupon the movie saying now is not the time waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater later keenan would sing on a track for the mr show incarnation run ronnie run and appear in the music video sex scene on its dvd keenan appeared on the cover of the mayjune  issue of pop smear magazine portraying charles manson as part of a photo essay imitating a famous life magazine portrait he also appeared as satan in the  film bikini bandits and its  sequel bikini bandits  golden rod when asked in an interview which role was more difficult keenan responded oh manson hes a real person people know what he looks like how he talked with satan theres so much gray area in the mids responding to requests for tool to perform in benefit shows keenan created free frances bean teeshirts to represent his own platform frances mother courtney love had previously referred to keenan as a media whore to which he responded isnt that great i have the distinction of being called a media whore by courtney love he said that after watching the tornado that is her mother he thought oh my god how is frances bean gonna survive this insanity although it was started as a simple joke the tshirts were soon in high demand and keenan was giving them away on april   the official tool website announced as an april fools day prank that maynard has found jesus and would be abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently kurt loder of mtv contacted keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation when loder asked again keenans response was simply heh heh on april  the official site revealed that it was a hoax during an interview keenan later stated it was april fools if you fall for that on april fools day theres nothing i can do for you he has been part of other april fools pranks related to tool including one in which he was said to be in critical condition after a tour bus accident keenan made his major feature film debut in the april   release of crank high voltage sharing a scene with the movies lead jason

vineyards and later named one of his wines after her honoring her memory with his cabernet sauvignon nagual del judith in a statement released in april  keenan stated i am standing on a metaphorical plateau the view from here suggests that iwe still have many mountains to negotiate it has already been a long journey but the successes and failures have been in balance which would suggest that iwe have chosen the correct path i hold in my hands the evidence to support this statement    with tears in my eyes i present to you the very first  percent arizona caduceus wine nagual del judith named after my late mother judith marie his previous wines were named after relatives of the chiricahua apache chief cochise who lived in the area where the vineyard is located and were produced at page
