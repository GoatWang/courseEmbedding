inside instagram’s reinvention  recode clock menu morearrow instagram social inside instagram’s reinvention how kevin systrom got over minimalism and snapped into building mode by kurt wagner jan   am est tweet share linkedin toward the tail end of  kevin systrom the ceo of instagram came to a realization the photosharing app he had founded five years earlier was straying too far from its roots instagram was growing yes and finally generating some serious ad dollars — which facebook had been waiting for since it bought the company for  billion back in  but its user base was also growing and it wasn’t all good growth instagram feeds that were once dominated by photos from friends and family members were becoming more impersonal brands celebrities and publishers had arrived en masse and with them the pressure to capture and share that perfect photo — the one that made you and your weekend hiking adventure look as cool as humanly possible — had escalated user feeds were riddled with what some saw as overproduced or inauthentic depictions of people’s lives the feed was becoming a digital game of keeping up with the joneses “it became a place where people kept raising the bar on themselves in terms of the quality of what they had to achieve to post” explained kevin weil instagram’s head of product who has been working to fix this problem since joining instagram from twitter in early  “we didn’t want that” that pressure on users led to pressure internally at instagram users started sharing less frequently according to a june  report from the information and snapchat the hot messaging app from la that facebook tried to buy but couldn’t was offering young people the kind of experience that instagram was not a lowpressure way to share photos and videos that don’t stick around online in april of last year a study from investment bank piper jaffray found that snapchat had surpassed instagram as the “most important” social network for teenagers a title instagram had held the previous two years another study by rbc found the same that teens would choose snapchat over instagram as the one social network they’d choose if they were trapped on a desert island instagram needed to evolve systrom did that by looking backward he refocused the company around priorities he says instagram held in its early days “your connections with your friends and your family are the thing that make instagram work” systrom  explained from facebook’s menlo park calif headquarters late last month “all the data supports that if you follow more friends and engage with your friends your activity goes through the roof if you just follow more celebrity content or more interestbased content that doesn’t move the needle at all” “your connections with your friends and your family are the thing that make instagram work” that realization led to a massive product push in  designed to make instagram more authentic encouraging users to share with friends in places outside of the traditional feed the list of major updates since may include instagram stories — montages of photos and short videos that users can share with their followers stories expire after  hours a feed ranking algorithm — a computer model that surfaces the posts instagram thinks you’ll like not just the most recently published content live video broadcasting — the ability to stream live video directly to your followers who in turn can send you messages while they watch the video feeds disappear after they’ve ended ephemeral messages — a new messaging feature that erases the photos or videos you send friends after they’ve been opened ask systrom for the “aha” moment that prompted such a rampant product revival and he won’t be able to name one he won’t comment on instagram’s sharing decline though he doesn’t deny it either and says snapchat “motivates us in the sense that i think that they’re really innovative” not exactly a rallying cry instead systrom chalks up instagram’s busy year to a combination of changes both structural and philosophical for starters instagram got much bigger the company’s engineering team which had long been run by cofounder mike krieger hired a new leader in fall of  jim everingham a former yahoo vp who oversaw engineering for yahoo’s homepage then everingham went on a hiring spree doubling his team’s size last year to more than  people krieger is still at instagram as cto but focused more on big picture issues the product organization grew too the key hire was weil the former product boss and longtime exec at twitter who oversaw the company’s ad products through the ipo weil was known inside twitter as a good operator he left the company in early  after a year and a half as twitter’s highestranking product executive weil now has the same role at instagram where he’s tasked with turning systrom’s visions into reality the duo have known each other for a decade — weil’s wife elizabeth went to stanford with systrom — and weil says getting the chance to work with systrom at instagram was a huge draw “systrom is absolutely one of the best product thinkers i’ve ever met” weil said in december from the company’s new office a threestory complex a short bike ride from facebook’s main headquarters “probably the best i’ve ever worked with” even with that growth instagram is still small compared to its peers it has just north of  employees despite a product with  million monthly users and  million daily users twitter for comparison has more than  employees for  million monthly users and snapchat has more than  employees for a daily user base half the size of instagram’s that’s not a completely fair comparison instagram has the luxury of tapping into facebook resources like data centers content moderation teams and advertising technology — things that its competitors have to build and support on their own but instagram is still taking advantage of its nimble staff “you can turn the ship much more quickly with smaller teams” weil explained “when we decide to do something the time difference between us making the decision and doing it is very small and that’s different if you have a multithousand person organization” weil says that instagram stories the company’s most significant product launch of the year and a direct copy of a snapchat feature with the same name was the first big product he worked on after joining systrom at instagram concept to launch took just four months of course it’s also faster to launch a product that’s nearly identical to one already on the market an instagram story from curbed vox media  curbed stories lets users share with their friends a montage of photos and videos that expire after  hours the feature has been a hit with instagram’s users  million people use stories every day that’s as many people as snapchat’s entire user base one reason people likely use stories is that you can’t really miss them instagram added the new feature at the very top of the home screen so it’s the first thing you see whenever you open the app in snapchat the app opens directly to the camera prompting you to share something but not necessarily something to stories “there’s no more bold move you could have made” weil said about the new product’s location “and it happened without the kind of existential debate because the founder and the ceo says this is the problem we need to solve” stories for example was never tested outside of facebook’s walls in other words it was a feature instagram’s top brass wanted regardless of whether or not its user base was on board systrom cites stories instagram’s ranked feed and even its decision to abandon squareonly photos back in august  as examples of “false constraints” that were holding instagram back “there was a change in philosophy internally of not being too precious about what got us here” systrom explained “i learned a lesson from watching other companies who held onto things too long if you look at the history of companies that have succeeded and the ones that have failed there’s a pretty clear pattern that the ones that have succeeded typically morph every couple of years into something new and that change is fairly uncomfortable” “there was a change in philosophy internally of not being too precious about what got us here” stories in particular was a change targeting the pressure around sharing that instagram executives had noticed in late  stories disappear after  hours meaning the bar for what qualifies as “postworthy” is usually much lower on stories than what you’ll find in your feed it’s a lot of the same stuff — food shots sunsets selfies — just less manicured instagram doesn’t deny that it borrowed the idea for stories weil says the feature was “built on a format that snapchat invented it’s because they were solving the same problem it’s a format and we believe that format will be universal” admitting to borrowing an idea is one thing but neither weil nor systrom will admit that snapchat’s rise in popularity is pushing instagram to move faster multiple former facebook employees say that snapchat is indeed a driving force — and instagram’s spate of very similar product launches seems to confirm the same “they motivate us in the sense that i think that they’re really innovative i think that they execute really well” systrom said “i think we run different companies and i think we have different goals in mind but we share a lot of the same aspirations” casual sharing is certainly one of those aspirations instagram also launched disappearing private messages another snapchat innovation and when you create a live video broadcast on instagram the video disappears as soon as the broadcast ends it doesn’t stick around as part of your profile these kinds of changes seem to be working for instagram the company added its last  million users in just six months the fastest growth rate in company history the sharing problem from  seems to be fixed too “in the last couple months with ranked feed and stories people are sharing more now than ever on a perperson basis and more people are sharing in total” systrom said without providing actual numbers “we have more people sharing every single day than ever before” that’s good news for facebook which seems to be betting on instagram to not only fend off snapchat but boost facebook’s sales instagram’s ad revenue has become more crucial to facebook which is starting to run out of places in its news feed to put advertisements instagram though is still just ramping up a business that analysts think could be huge research firm emarketer estimates that nearly three quarters of us companies over  employees will use instagram for marketing in  more than the number that will do the same on twitter credit suisse meanwhile estimated back in april that instagram would bring in more than  billion in revenue in  though other analyst firms offered more conservative estimates facebook doesn’t yet break out instagram’s financials that growth will no doubt be challenged by snapchat parent company snap which is gearing up for an ipo this year snapchat had the original stories product and has emerged as instagram’s largest and really only major threat instagram just recently started selling the same type of full screen vertical video ads that snapchat has popularized and the two apps will be fighting to win marketer budgets and of course fighting for your selfies and messages too “our mission is to strengthen relationships through shared experiences” systrom said “and we’re going to be best at that in the world”  among those hired by instagram in  was my fiancée whom i’ve been with for seven years she took a job as an administrative assistant with instagrams marketing

an ideal fit with the alwayswithyou iphone in today’s social media world instagram’s a social network built around photos where people can quickly comment on or ‘like’ photos and share them on twitter or facebook  systrom identifies instagram as a media company which explains the rollout of video advertisement by big companies such as disney activision lancome banana republic and cw in late  under

regarded as the most important social network among teenagers aged  to  the first time in two years that instagram did not feature at the top instagram currently employs around  people the app is used by  million people per month and  million per day its competitors snapchat and twitter employ more people for a smaller user base with twitter having  employees for  million monthly users and snapchat employing  people for half of instagram’s daily user base in the future systrom seeks to develop instagram further to better integrate the use of videos into the app he also stated that in a few years the company might be getting involved in virtual reality products according to quartz and the new york times systrom and krieger implemented a system to overcome bottlenecks and slow decisionmaking in the company by scheduling meetings in which only decisions are taken this approach was informed by systroms interest in academic business theories in particular clayton m christensens concept of the “the innovator’s dilemma” views on copying ideas in the industryedit instagram has been called out in multiple occasions for copying various new functions from its closest competitor snapchat

posing for a photograph when we meet at instagram hq arms splayed across the back of a sleek black sofa with a knowing grin “more photos” he sighs as he is moved to another spot in the room with all the unconvincing exasperation of someone who quite likes having his picture taken and so he should because as the cofounder of instagram he gets asked a lot systrom is a rangy ft in and prides himself on dressing smartly by silicon valley standards today he wears a light grey jacket over his tshirt and dark trousers he seems older than his  years and has a certain swagger exuding the selfassurance that comes with having built a bn technology company and a personal fortune of around m in a former life this meeting room was bland and corporate – white plastic table grey carpet black mesh chairs – but a visit from al gore in may last year changed all that systrom says “this” he says channelling the former vicepresident’s scorn “is an instagram meeting room” he called a designer friend from san francisco who sourced green s chairs and a huge white marble table customised wallpaper based on staff fingerprints and prints of favourite pictures taken by the instagram team on the other side of the freeway sits facebook’s newest frank gehrydesigned office housing  in one giant room given instagram’s strong sense of aesthetic you’d think they’d mind not having space inside their mothership but systrom insists they operate as a separate company they are tucked away instead on facebook’s menlo park campus it’s a sprawling pristine plain set of buildings from the outside the former home of sun microsystems wedged between the freeway and the swampy southern edges of san francisco bay the receptionist is baffled that i have arrived by public transport facebook and instagram staff either drive or are shuttled the  miles from san francisco in luxury coaches with wifi and air conditioning presumably so they can keep working until the last possible moment inside the floor is stripped back to the concrete and the walls are decorated with motivational posters “kick the shit out of plan b” “leadership is best measured by what people do when you’re not around” “looking for love in the great forest of like” inside a central courtyard there is an icecream parlour brightly coloured food stalls wooden benches and energetic young people looking as if they are busy changing the world instagram passes m users as young shun tweets for photo op read more founded five years ago instagram was born during a summer holiday in mexico’s boho beach town of todos santos then  systrom was sketching out new app ideas for the aspiring location service burbn he was building users could check in at various locations and report back on their meetups having already secured a  investment talking through an idea to introduce photographs to burbn systrom’s girlfriend nicole schuetz said she wouldn’t want to post hers because they wouldn’t look good enough her iphone  didn’t have a great camera the answer they concluded was to add filters by the end of the day systrom had created the xpro ii filter and posted an image of a dog and schuetz’s foot on an early version of instagram codenamed codename “that first picture became everything and more than we wanted it to be” he says pointing out that the office coffee table is built around a giant print of that first photograph “back then there was no way of showing what was going on in your life as it happened facebook was still primarily desktop flickr was about uploading from your slr camera and twitter barely had any photo support that left this opportunity wide open to share what was happening in your life visually” instagram was born just a few months after the iphone  a way of disguising its lowquality pictures since then systrom explains filter usage has declined as mobile picture quality has improved instagram itself however has done anything but decline with an unfathomable bn photos shared to date systrom with jamie oliver russell brand and liam payne photograph getty images did he foresee the size to which the site would grow “obviously we couldn’t have predicted the scale but it makes sense our brains are primarily visual letterform was just a hack until people worked out how to communicate more perceptually” comparisons with guttenberg’s thcentury printing press and its revolutionary effect are popular with heads of technology firms who clearly hope to have as big an impact and it is possible that some of today’s biggest tech firms may initiate a new age of enlightenment it is equally likely they will implode after a few years and be replaced by the next cool thing this is systrom’s challenge to stay on the right side of that equation  the rapid growth of instagram and its popularity with everyone from designers to photojournalists and politicians is one of silicon valley’s favourite fables its followers include president obama advocating obamacare david beckham berating the daily mail for criticising his parenting skills and kim kardashian trying to break the internet it makes room for the mundane plumbers sharing their latest jobs teachers sharing the delight and horror of the classroom it features bad taxidermy and horrific autopsy shots it hosts millions of us snapping our holidays our children our shopping and a disproportionate number of sunsets only  months after founding the company with just  employees serving  million users systrom and cofounder mike krieger found themselves caught in a bidding war between twitter and facebook mark zuckerberg’s persistence and deep pockets won out with a deal eventually worth after a dip in facebook’s share price m it’s very hard to succeed without giving your entire life to this thing “it was a lot of luck a lot of opportunity and a lot of hard work” systrom says now of the deal and the months that led up to it “weekends didn’t exist mike and i set up an alarm on our phones if the servers were overloaded and went down and that went off every four or five hours then as we grew it went off every hour or every  minutes to this day i have a pavlovian response to that alarm simultaneous nausea and anxiety but it was also a sign of growth which is a great problem to have now it’s different problems what do we work on what’s our strategy how do we fend off competitors” why does he think this punishing work culture appeals to so many “when you’re small it’s very hard to succeed without giving your entire life to this thing the technology moves so fast and the context – your competition – changes so quickly that the one advantage you have as a small company is speed you can pack three to four working days into one day and gain an advantage” silicon valley is known for being pressurised highly competitive and stuffed with ambitious people who push themselves – and sometimes fail to admit they are struggling to cope research published in april by dr michael freeman at the university of california in san francisco found  of the entrepreneurs he surveyed reported a mental health condition  felt depressed the us average is  and  had anxiety concerns suicides of company founders have cast a shadow over the industry including yearold ilya zhitomirskiy of diaspora yearold ecomom cofounder jody sherman and in may this year yearold austen heinz of cambrian genomics systrom’s favourite accounts include petesouza the white house’s official photographer who posted this shot but overwork seems a world away from instagram whose staff seem content in their secure and rapidly growing company i am taken on a tour by the publicist admittedly but their delight appears genuine “it’s my dream job” does systrom feel a duty of care towards his often very young team “people don’t work in a dotcom because they have to” he says “there are many professions that don’t require that sort of time but people sign up because they want to make worldchanging differences to build something that affects millions of people these are the companies that in just a couple of years can change entire industries” systrom says instagram conducts anonymous surveys to check the health of its staff and is respectful of weekends and families “you don’t win a marathon by sprinting all day” he says not sounding as heartfelt as when talking about his ambition to change the world the melancholy streets of baku azerbaijans everchanging capital – in pictures read more later i talk to ashley yuki a product manager who oversaw the recent introduction of portrait and landscape formats to the service instagram’s square format photos are a legacy of systrom using a holga camera while studying photography in florence italy for one term of his stanford degree the switch was big news in instagram world yuki coordinates designers engineers marketing and every other team to get new features out on time does she feel silicon valley has a longhours problem “we are measured on the impact of our work – the number of people who use it the feedback from users the results of what we did – not how many hours we’ve worked that lends itself to a more meritocratic culture my schedule is flexible and i have lots of control we work hard and i like that so it’s a burden and a joy to be the person who can fit all those pieces together”  kevin systrom was born in the wealthy massachusetts suburb of holliston to a human resources executive father and a marketing executive mother who worked at monster and swapit during the first dotcom boom at middlesex boarding school in concord he started to learn programming later at stanford studying management science and engineering he interned at odeo the company that went on to found twitter systrom sat next to jack dorsey but that didn’t help dorsey during negotiations to buy instagram which systrom and krieger sold to facebook for nearly twice twitter’s offer dorsey hasn’t posted to instagram since systrom’s life outside work is as carefully curated as his instagram feed he’s into fine food golf skiing and holidays at california’s lake tahoe his favourite instagrammers are symmetrybreakfast exactly that everydayafrica a group of photographers publishing shots from across the continent and petesouza the white house’s official photographer he insists he’s been to few fashion shows despite being photographed on the front row with alexa chung and at awards ceremonies with diane von furstenberg and kim kardashian he is adept at redirecting unwelcome questions when i ask if he has any political allegiances and joke that he might have an opinion on donald trump a strategic user of instagram he simply says he’s not political no he hasn’t met trump the other presidential candidates campaign just as effectively through his service too with kim kardashian at the cfda fashion awards in june photograph getty images instagram’s new “search and explore” feature rolled out in june for american users only now highlights collections of instagram accounts – extreme sports for example travel or fashion it is designed to surface more diverse content and show what’s trending now is this editorialising systrom resists the word while claiming instagram has rivalled his experience of television news most powerfully when users posted hundreds of pictures of the devastation wrought by hurricane sandy in near real time in october  instagram began with  users on its first day now thanks in part to the facebook deal it has  million people using the site every month with  million photos shared every day systrom says this growth is largely down to facebook’s considerable resources when it comes to sales advertising their targeting and relevance algorithms which he claims are helping instagram mature more quickly than its rivals research company emarketer suggests instagram will reach m in ad revenue this year but that this will grow to bn in  remarkably instagram is also predicted to have bigger net mobile display ad revenues than twitter and google by then having introduced more innovative formats while it’s hard to see how systrom could have turned down facebook – an offer so big it astonished many in the tech industry at the time – what would have become of instagram if it hadn’t signed up “a lot of great things have happened” systrom says “there are fun parts of running a startup and notsofun parts and facebook handles the notsofun parts like infrastructure spam sales the real questions are how big can instagram get is it  million or bigger can it be a viable business if it is that big these are at the top of the list for everyone in silicon valley” how big can instagram get is it  million or bigger these are no doubt the kind of questions he puts to zuckerberg when they meet on campus the facebook founder pursued him aggressively in  then after making the offer retired to watch game of thrones while systrom made frantic calls to lawyers and investors the pair meet weekly inside and outside of work and by all accounts have much in common with zuckerberg savvy enough to give systrom the space he needs being under the care of facebook is a constant reminder of how much bigger instagram could be “at facebook which has  billion users every month we’re the little kid on the block if you ask someone on the street in india if they use instagram they will say no – so that’s an opportunity for us” this is what silicon valley’s investors love to hear unapologetic ambitions for global growth no holds barred it’s not just systrom who is making money from the site many instagrammers claim to be earning a significant income including sharmadean reid of wahnails dutch fishmonger bart van olphen who has used its second videos to build his cookery brand and new yorker liz eswein newyorkcity who has  million followers and claims to charge advertisers  for every “like” on a sponsored photo the money starts coming in when you have more than  followers which can be worth upwards of £ a month according to professional instagrammer brian difeo who founded an agency advising others on how to exploit the service seventyfive per cent of users are outside the us  million of them in the uk i suggest to systrom that this is photo sharing on a massive scale he disagrees “calling instagram a photosharing app is like calling a newspaper a lettersharing book or a mozart grand era symphony a series of notes instagram is less about the medium and more about the network if you’re a business we have a product so you can buy ads if you’re a consumer and want to entertain you can record a second looping video if you’re an artist and want to do a piece of conceptual art there’s a place for you too ‘photo sharing’ misses the nuance”  what makes one picture better than the other an understanding of light is what separates a great photographer from a mediocre one says richard koci hernandez assistant professor of new media at uc berkeley’s journalism school in san francisco “humans are conditioned to see strong shapes and patterns and it’s light combined with capturing that human moment that can stop people in their tracks ” hernandez was one of the first news photographers to document silicon valley’s smartphone era and has been using instagram since it launched yet late last year he deleted more than  photos from his instagram account because they were making him feel trapped he says a year on he wants to do the same thing again with the  images he has published since – monochrome lone figures an atmospheric city snatched moments of real life double shot latte london’s symmetrybreakfast another of systrom’s three favourite accounts “my images are a reflection of me as a photographer so is that me we are all influenced by likes and comments in a social space and i have thousands of images and tons of followers” and he does  of them “that was influencing who i was and i was thinking too much about what i was posting we are all trying to find our voice and find what is authentic but the comments push you in a certain direction that is less objective” hernandez says he would like his images to live momentarily which is exactly the appeal of instagram’s biggest rival snapchat estimated to have  million users many of them younger than instagram’s “that backlog starts to define you” hernandez says “but i think we’re always different and evolving i’d like my images to live a couple of days and then die so i don’t have to remember or be tied” hernandez is sanguine about the popularity of selfies and pictures of latte foam he sees instagram as a collective experiment in visual communication “that’s what humanity does when we get together – we want everyone to look at us it’s the game we’re all playing expecting anything more from a medium in its infancy is too much to ask i believe in the power of latte foam communication has to be homogenous at the start after that the creativity and nuance creeps in and artists move the medium to the edges” maybe so but even ai weiwei uses instagram for selfies systrom gives short shrift to the suggestion that his service has been overrun by hipsters and narcissists uploading pictures of their coffee “with so many people it’s hard to have uniformity or predictability there are performance artists sports stars celebrities people singing and doing dubsmashes and yes hipsters use instagram but last year we had activist katie meyler documenting ebola on the ground raising awareness of the epidemic in a way no one else could we had stunning photos of the baltimore riots the winter storm juno that made the cover of the new york times these are not hipster shots of lattes” why did instagram succeed where other similar services failed there was a swath of photofilter apps available in  and most fell by the wayside systrom puts a large part of his success down to luck i’d also put it down to a combination of simple design improved smartphone cameras and an appetite for a broader network based on visual images the service has grown thoughtfully even cautiously so that it remains accessible but it will need to work hard to compete against the excitement and spontaneity of snapchat the speed and simplicity of text messaging and photography fatigue the more pictures we take the less we seem to value them other challenges lie beyond the horizon where the biggest threat might now be no more than a sketch in someone’s notebook so where does instagram go from here i ask systrom to imagine the most fantastical feature he could add “imagine a world where virtual reality exists and is ubiquitous and we have whatever device we need to experience it how cool would it be if you were at a concert in the countryside and i could be there with you – hearing smelling seeing it too or the presidential inauguration – that would be amazing that’s what instagram is now in a very lowfidelity way i like to say we’re working on time travel but the difference is we’re not sending you there – it’s coming to you” an instagram post of the juno storm new york january  photograph junowinterstorm top of systrom’s priorities right now is his wedding to college sweetheart schuetz next summer it will be a local affair and combine good food and wine he has read somewhere that english weddings are traditionally in the morning so he wants to do that in california this counts as eccentric i tell him it means everyone just gets more drunk in the afternoon because there’s nothing else to do before the party and an eyebrow crumples he is trying to work out if this is good or bad more importantly will the wedding be on instagram “i don’t think we could get away with not putting it on instagram” he concedes “but i don’t think it will trend” whatever comes next systrom is made for life he is a model of what success currently looks like in silicon valley – young white and male with all the confidence opportunity and connections that an expensive education can provide five years in and instagram has joined the elite group of technology firms now shaping our world albeit from a very particular perspective i’m struck by the disparity between instagram the cool sleek world it inhabits on and offline and the real world outside we see we share but what then it is hometime at facebook as i leave the building and a fleet of pristine luxury buses arrives to ferry everyone back to san francisco i cross the nine lanes of freeway again and pay my  to catch the bus back over the bay it is a beautiful hazy evening and for a second i think i might instagram it but i put my phone back in my bag rest my head on the window and my eyes catch sight of a seal bobbing up from the water instead topics instagram

worked at twitter as a top exec to take the job soon after weil joined instagram user and advertiser growth took off john shinal  johnshinal saturday  jul    am etcnbccom shares instagram ceo kevin systrom had a key role to fill in early  he was seeking to revamp the photosharing service hed cofounded with mike krieger six years earlier and which facebook had bought in  after keeping instagrams executive ranks intentionally small systrom was putting together a team to help him overhaul the site the objective was to get users—especially younger ones—to post more content on instagram at the time snapchat was growing fast among youthful social media users thanks to fun features like funny photo filters and disappearing videos systrom had already poached some big names from silicon valley rivals getting ian spalter from youtube as head of design in early  and hiring yahoos james everingham as head of engineering six months later now he needed someone to get the features and tools being designed and built onto the site and into the hands of instagram users as he searched for someone to help him implement his product roadmap systrom asked a friend venture capitalist elizabeth weil to arrange a dinner weil whod spent four years as a partner at the marquee investment firm andreessen horowitz before becoming managing partner of a new firm  ventures is married to kevin weil whom shed met when they were both students at stanford university kevin weil had quit the universitys phd program in theoretical physics to start working at twitter in  when the social media service had just  employees after seven years at twitter he had worked his way up to executive vice president overseeing all of the companys products including its consumerfacing site advertising products and the vine and periscope video tools elizabeth weil arranged the dinner during it systrom offered kevin weil a job running product for instagram according to an onstage interview weil gave in may to stanford professor tina seelig as part of the universitys discussion program for prospective entrepreneurs weil says he turned systrom down hed already resigned from twitter where user growth had begun to wane and planned to take six months off to train for a mile foot race that traveled the course of the american river in californias central valley whats more he and his wife had started a family weil who is  was enjoying time off and had just attended the super bowl which was held that year in santa clara california according to his twitter feed i like running long races but then he reconsidered i said no then said to myself why should i turn this down weil said in the video weil a whiz at math and later at physics grew up in redmond washington home of microsoft where his dad had worked for two decades after his own long stint with one company weil told seelig i wanted to see how other companies did things weil took the job in march —and then finished the american river  in april where he placed fifth i like running long races weil stated a comment that should put fear into the hearts of snap investors theres not a lot of tricks to running a mile race you just start running and keep going people underestimate the value of fighting through it he said equally as impressive is what weil and the rest of the team systrom put together have managed to pull off in the last year and a half he was a great hirea key player said krishna subramanian ceo of captiv a startup that provides analytics to social media sites and their users who create popular content hes been a critical part of their success said subramanian whos sold several companies hes cofounded previously including mobclix and bluelithium within months of weils arrival the site began to roll out a raft of new tools and features to match what snapchat was doing the key was instagram stories a feature that let users share photos and videos for up to  hours before they disappeared mimicking the similar snapchat stories feature in november it began letting users post images and videos that disappeared right away—the feature that originally made snapchat famous—and in may  it added face filters one of snapchats most popular features source instagram soon instagrams growth in both users and ads began to surge it was aided not only by the tools weil and others helped get out the door but also by a savvy digital marketing plan facebook sent repeated notifications to its own users telling them which of their online friends were already on instagram the plan worked in june  instagram had  million monthly users by april  it had grown  percent to  million more users brought more online marketers in late march instagram hit  million advertisers double the  it had last september as its growth accelerated snapchats began to flatten out in the first quarter snapchats number of daily users grew only  percent from the previous year to  million instagram stories meanwhile has grown to  million daily users in less than a year on the market its the fastestgrowing product ive ever seen weil stated in the video instagram which zuckerberg bought for  billion five years ago is expected to post sales of  billion in  according to the market research firm emarketer how instagram did it when weil joined in spring  he said in the the instagram brass had come to a conclusion a year ago instagram was a product for your highlights rather than a place where users posted content about more routine events in their lives weil said in the video in other words it had not changed much since systrom had started it as a sort of daily photo diary back in  if you start simple systems will get more complex eventuallyif you start complex youre in trouble kevin weil head of product instagram if people are going to post multiple times throughout the day the product needs to be more personoriented than feedoriented weil explained that meant allowing users to post not only square photos but videos of varying shapes sizes and lengths instagram also has a culture designed for doing the simple things first in the video he says if you start simple systems will get more complex eventuallyif you start complex youre in trouble also while big product launches are important what people miss are the little changesfacebook and instagram are better at that than anyone he says weil whose person team as of may work all in the same room also credits systrom and zuckerberg for maintaining instagrams independence i give a lot of credit to the two founderswere a tiny company that gets to be a superpower because were part of facebook according to weil as for snapchat weil gives it its due— up to a point snapchat was the first to create the formatmore power to them they did a fantastic job he said an insane personal life in the  months since weil joined instagram something else has grown his wife had twins and now the couple have three very young children according to his twitter feed and the video when seelig asked whether his life has balance weil chuckled and described his home life as insanitylife is insane between six and nine pm asked whether he sleeps weil answered not much thats mostly what we sacrifice in spite of all that this past spring he ran the american river  again and did slightly better finishing fourth in a fitting bit of irony weil also attended harvard at the same time as mark zuckerberg who never finished his harvard degree zuckerberg received an honorary degree last month when he delivered the universitys commencement speech after zuckerberg left for california and never came back weil who as a junior was one year ahead of zuckerberg described his reaction im sitting there going hes giving up a harvard degree to go work on some company what an

and pitched it to baseline ventures and andreessen horowitz at a party he came up with the idea while on a vacation in mexico when his girlfriend was unwilling to post her photos because they did not look good enough when taken by the iphone  camera the solution to the problem was to use filters effectively hiding the qualitative inferiority of the photographs subsequently systrom developed the xpro ii filter that is still in use on instagram today after the first meeting he decided to quit his job in order to explore whether or not burbn could become a company within  weeks of quitting his job he received  seed funding round from both baseline ventures and andreessen horowitz while in san francisco systrom and mike krieger built burbn a html  checkin service into a product that allowed users to do many things check into locations make plans future checkins earn points for hanging out with friends post pictures and much more however recalling their studies in mayfield fellows program krieger and systrom identified that burbn contained too many features and the users did not want a complicated product they decided to focus on one specific feature photosharing the development of

instagram was sold to facebook for  billion in cash and stock along with  employees according to multiple reports the deal netted systrom  million based on his ownership stake in the business one of the key contributions to the acquisition is that mark zuckerberg stated facebook is committed to building and growing instagram independently allowing systrom to continue to lead instagram systrom stated in an interview with bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of facebook were that “we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow understands how to build a business has one of the best if not the best management team in tech and we got to use them as our resource” in an interview with forbes he stated that instagram is a new form of communication that’s an ideal fit with the alwayswithyou iphone in today’s social media world instagram’s a social network built around photos where people can quickly comment on or ‘like’ photos and share them on twitter

yahoocomparecardssponsoreddivorceanthony scaramucci’s wife has reportedly filed for divorcecourtesy of instagram under how kevin systrom got starteddaniel robertsoct  kevin systrom didnt plan on starting a company hed sell to facebook for  billion he got his start in a record store of all places but it was a sudden love of photography combined with an affinity for technology—perhaps inspired by his mother who worked in the sector— that led to the creation of the nowubiquitous photosharing app in this excerpt from zoom surprising ways to supercharge your career—a book fortune released last year that tells the exclusive origin stories of  alums of the  under  over the years—daniel roberts recounts how systrom no  on our   under  list and the newest boardmember at walmart got his start in business kevin systroms mother was early to technologyshe worked at monstercom during the first tech startup boom and later at zipcar much like how jess lee cofounder and ceo of polyvore no  on the   under  was influenced by her mother being an entrepreneur systroms fierce love of technology and his own entrepreneurship were ushered along by his mothers work at hot tech companiesas a teenager systrom created programs that would prank his friends by appearing to hack their aol instant messenger accounts but his first real job once he got to high school wasn’t about technology at all he worked at boston beat an oldschool vinylrecord store on posh newbury street “i was obsessed with deejaying” he tells fortune “so i would email the store every other day to get a job there i pestered them and pestered them and finally they let me in and i worked a couple hours a week” thanks to his experience at boston beat systrom was soon opening for real djs at boston club shows though he had to get help from older friends to sneak into the clubs since he was still under  “one thing about my background is i get very obsessed with something” systrom explains adding that he used to stockpile giant stacks of records in a corner of his bedroom both this singleminded focus and retro sensibility would serve him well with instagramwhen it came time to apply to college the obvious choice was stanford with its tech offerings and deep ties to silicon valley systrom applied earlydecision with a planned focus on computer science but once he got there he found that the classes were more academic than applied so he switched to stanford’s management science and engineering program which had a focus on more practical subjects like finance and economicsobject object   photo brad barketgetty much as mark zuckerberg who would later buy systrom’s company did at harvard toying with code to create games for his friends to use systrom built web programs in his free time one of them was a photo site he and his fraternity brothers had set up to share party pictures internally soon enough he realized just how much photography interested him during a junior year abroad in florence an italian professor showed systrom a holga—a cheap camera first popular in china that developed a cult following because of its lowfi retrostyle photos the young tech whiz adored the aesthetic of the images they looked hipduring the summer before his senior year in college systrom interned at odeo a podcast startup created by evan williams who would go on to cofound twitter odeo which launched at about the same time as facebook gave users an easy way to record and share podcasts which were becoming popular thanks to the ubiquity of the ipod and digital music one of the people working at odeo full time while systrom was interning there was jack dorsey another twitter cofounder with williams and biz stone systrom and dorsey hit it off tweaking apps together for odeo dorsey would later come in handy as a key connection for systrom in the tech world “i learned so much from ev and jack” he says “the whole thing was really eyeopening for me”more instagram big bad and ready to make moneyin his senior year at stanford systrom had opportunities at a number of tech companies including microsoft but he took a marketing job at google which in many ways was the place to be for stanford grads eager to make their mark but systrom wasn’t writing code or working on cool new products he was handling marketing projects for gmail and calendar after two years he managed to switch to google’s ma division where he learned about big tech deals and the money it takes to do them still three years into his time at google systrom grew restless he had gone there straight out of college and the large corporate environment took its toll on someone who had always wanted to be an entrepreneur “i always had this itch” he says “i wanted to get back in the social space” he left google for a job at a social site called nextstop which offered travel recommendations there he was able to do more of what he had wanted all along write code and create appstyle programs for the site including games revolving around photosit was becoming more and more obvious to systrom that he had to pursue his passion for photography and social sharing fulltime he was ready to start his own thing something that married those two interests and rode the rising tide of mobile locationbased gaming and social networking he began working on it in his spare time and called the idea burbn matching the typical misspellings and missing letters of your typical startup names and also paying homage to his favorite spirit bourbon he made a prototype for the app which allowed for locationbased photo sharing a mashup in a sense of foursquare and flickrat a party in january  systrom met and impressed steve anderson a bay area venture capitalist who had founded the firm baseline ventures though burbn was still just an idea anderson committed  in the same round marc andreessen and ben horowitz whose venture capital firm was and remains one of silicon valley’s best known also invested  systrom quit his job at nextstop which was bought by facebook that julybecause so many successful tech startups seemed to have a pair of cofounders or a trio but rarely just one person systrom felt he needed a cofounder he tapped his friend mike krieger a fellow stanford graduate two years his junior krieger too was working on an app—his was a chat platform called meebo—but when systrom showed him the burbn prototype he dug it krieger came aboard in march  but almost immediately systrom wanted the company to pivot burbn was really too similar to foursquare he reasoned which was becoming very popular burbn got a lot of hype in tech blogs but it didn’t really go anywhere one piece of it however caught on photo sharingthe duo decided to make photos the whole point burbn had had too many different features what would be a hit they knew was something simple that did one thing they stripped the app of its bells and whistles and made it a tool tailored for only the iphone at first—the iphone  had just come out and had a highquality builtin camera—that would overlay pictures with holgainspired lenses the app calls them filters and today has  of them to choose from that make them hip and artsy systrom thought of it as an “instant telegram” hence the name instagrammore from zoom how we started rent the runwaysystrom and krieger worked on instagram feverishly for eight weeks tweaking code and refining the visual design but they also didn’t sweat the details beyond photo filters and basic sharing buttons perhaps that goes against the usual logic for launching a company but in their case it worked well says systrom “we had worked on burbn for so long this time we just wanted to get it out and get it into users’ hands”mike krieger l and kevin systrom photographed in menlo park ca may   photograph by robyn twomey for fortune on the night of oct   when they were at last ready to go they pressed the launch button and tweeted about the new app press coverage followed right away much of it from blogs that had written about systrom when his app was called burbn two hours after instagram went live its servers came tumbling down because of the rush of traffic systrom and krieger freaked out and feared instant failure but in fact it was the best thing they could have hoped for they pulled an allnighter working like crazy to get the servers back up and then to keep them online and runningclose to  people had signed up for an account in instagram’s first  hours the next day “after getting three hours of sleep” systrom recalls “we were exhausted but we knew we had created something different we had a really good feeling about it”people loved the way the app allowed them to make their photographs unique and they liked the presentation of the entire interace—all squared or rounded edges bright colors neat cursive and tiny profile pictures for each user the app wasn’t bogged down with personal information or a list of friends and interests you merely chose to “follow” others à la twitter and once you applied a filter and pushed “share” your photo was out there for anyone to enjoy to show that you liked someone else’s picture you could doubletapped it with your finger and a heart popped uprelatedapplebozoma saint john leaving apple report saysapplebozoma saint john leaving apple report saysinstagram of course was not without competition systrom says that when they launched it “a slew of people came out with similar apps and i think since then one by one they’ve begun to do other things” that included color a particularly hyped app that touted itself as a facebook for photosmore from zoom dolf van den brink stands fast with heinekenwithin nine months instagram had  million users includ ing influential techloving celebrities like justin bieber and ryan seacrest and “to instagram” became its own verb in the tech world vernacular “the majority of folks sign up thinking they’re going to just make cool photos” explains systrom “but then as part of that they’ll start posting and discover all these other users and this strong community they trade likes comments and it becomes a whole new social graph”that’s likely what caused facebook to take notice some users had stopped using mark zuckerberg’s network to post photos and instead were sharing them via their instagram feed which had a different visual layout that they liked and was for mobile phones only in april  less than two years after insta gram launched facebook announced it was buying the startup the news rocked the tech world made systrom a star and brought the app to the immediate attention of anyone who somehow still had not heard of itwhen systrom first spoke to fortune a year after instagram’s launch and mere months before facebook came calling he wrestled with the question of where his app fit in among the bigger players “as we grow larger like to  million users” systrom said “the question is where do we fit in the ecosystem of the twitters the facebooks etc because we’re so imagefocused i think we’ll find a very nice natural home” that home though he didn’t know it then would be facebook which after buying instagram allowed systrom and his stilltiny person team to continue working independently within the larger social network systrom had predicted too its value to a larger company “as offline dollars start to shift to online people are ready to spend money on social media” he said “how that manifests itself is still many months out but we think it’s a multibilliondollar market”more best instagrammers of the   under in contrast to its parent company which has become busier and more multifaceted with additional sections and features every month instagram has kept things remarkably simple even while rapidly scaling it has added more filters made it easier to tweet a photo right from within the instagram app and offered the facebooklike ability to tag a friend in a photo it has added advertising through sponsored photos that appear in your stream but overall the service has not drastically changed from what it was four years ago in november  instagram added an online component which let users view their photos on a web browser making the product no longer strictly mobile but the feature still didn’t represent a major change in its function systroms star has continued to rise recently he became a walmart boardmember and his app remains redhot despite some fears when facebook bought it he and krieger have kept it uncomplicated“anyone can build a social photosharing site” says systrom “and in fact many people have our community is our biggest asset so we need to protect that—make sure people are happy we realize that no one on this earth has the golden touch and we try to stay humble” that and stay simple
