new age beverages acquires premier micronutrient corporation  bevnetcom bevnet  new age beverages acquires premier micronutrient corporation martín caballero may   at  pm more new age beverages is continuing upon its aggressive expansion strategy and today announced that it has acquired premier micronutrient corporation pmc a maker of nutrientdense supplements in picking up pmc founded in  to develop formulations in cooperation with the us department of defense and national aeronautics and space administration nasa new age secured intellectual property — including  major patents and patents pending in various areas of micronutrientbased treatments — that it plans to use to fuel product innovation in both the short and long term the nocash agreement brings  percent of the assets and interests of pmc its portfolio of products intellectual property and the formulas for existing and planned healthy functional beverage products for the pharmacy medical sports and military and other industries the move marks the third acquisition for new age this year following the purchase of maverick brands makers of coco libre and the full assets of marley beverage company in april speaking with bevnet new age ceo brent willis said that the pmc acquisition was another step forward in the company’s goal to be the global leader in healthy functional beverages and that the research and scientific expertise gained in the deal will allow new age to continue exploring new sales opportunities including those within the medical industry with less competitive intensity “today the products that address things like cardiovascular health or weight management have a delivery system of pills and powders” he said “that’s the evolution it goes from pills to powders to a readytodrink more consumer friendly and more efficacious delivery system” in addition to patents for micronutrient formulations for diabetes treatment radiation and other applications pmc brings medical expertise research clinical trial insight and a strong reputation within the scientific community into the fold at new age’s health sciences division pediaade an organic coconut waterbased rehydration drink will be the first product to be released with input from the division when it debuts later this summer willis said the beverage formulated to alleviate symptoms associated with significant dehydration is indicative of the company’s strategy of identifying existing consumer behaviors and segments and designing new products around them “when you have the credibility and the science and you start in the medical channel and pharmacy channel ultimately when you want to take it out to broad based consumers it’s just that much more supported in terms of the benefits” said willis “we want to be building off of existing large need states and segments versus coming up with crazy healthy niches” willis pointed toward a soontobereleased new product developed by the health sciences division in conjunction with scientists at the mayo clinic and the cleveland clinic aimed at reducing postsurgery stress and recovery time “the public is demanding that credible information done with legitimate studies which we have and that drives a hunger for products that are not a pill that a doctor prescribes from a pharmacy” said dr jerry haase chief scientific officer for the health sciences division “the number of interesting products that fill a definite need in the marketplace that we are developing and will develop is quite an impressive list” reaffirming the company’s goal to push differentiated products in segments relatively unexplored by its competitors willis said the pmc acquisition was indicative of his overall vision for new age’s place on the industry landscape “we have about an  million run rate with revenue” he said “we can’t afford to waste time and do little niche kind of things” latest news seattle’s sound kombucha on the rise basemakers and phoodie merge juice

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information
