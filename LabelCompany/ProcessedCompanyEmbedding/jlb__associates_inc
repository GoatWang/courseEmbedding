services provided people jlb filings regulatory filings investor center financial websites economic data contact us    our investment philosophy   we believe the most successful philosophy in building wealth for our clients requires a disciplined investment approach together with a longterm view of the markets consequently markettiming and other shortterm strategies are not part of the process in attempting to earn aboveaverage rates of return we offer portfolios that are comprised entirely of common stocks as well as a mixture of both stocks and bonds our investment approach common stocks the center of equity common stocks portfolio management at jlb  associates is a welldefined analytical process for selecting common stocks and a disciplined procedure for investing individual portfolios in those stock selections our common stock selection process is driven by our universe of two hundred companies which is ranked based on their expected investment returns our  common stock universe contains companies that are highly profitable have relatively low debt retain a large portion of their earnings and appear attractively valued compared with the overall market with rare exception the stocks are of companies incorporated in the united states many of which have large international operations the universe is comprised of small medium and large capitalization companies the goal of the common stock portion of a client’s portfolio is to outperform the standard  poor’s  composite stock index measured over a three to five year time horizon bonds the procedure for managing fixed income portfolios is to select high quality bonds that are rated “investment grade” baabbb or better at the time of purchase bonds with unusually long maturities and callable bonds are avoided based on the outlook for interest rates a decision may be made to lengthen or shorten the maturity structure of a client’s portfolio usually such an adjustment is gradual and without a high rate of turnover
