cue biopharma debuts with  million in invested capital to develop nextgeneration biologics to selectively control t cell activity  business wire cue biopharma debuts with  million in invested capital to develop nextgeneration biologics to selectively control t cell activity biologics platform targets t cellmediated diseases in oncology and autoimmunity experienced management team board of directors and scientific advisory board named january    am eastern standard time cambridge massbusiness wirecue biopharma inc cue an immunotherapy company developing biologics engineered to selectively modulate diseaserelevant t cell subsets to treat cancer and autoimmune disease announced today a total of  million of invested private capital led by mdb capital group guided by an experienced management team and preeminent board members and scientific advisors cue will use the proceeds to accelerate development of its novel platform of t cell receptor tcr targeted biologics to control immune responses in patients cue was founded in  with  million of seed funding followed by a  million followon financing “it has become increasingly clear that more effective and less toxic approaches to immune modulation are needed via precise communication with and control of t cells said daniel passeri msc jd president and chief executive officer of cue biopharma “with the cue platform we have demonstrated selectivity for and modulation of diseaserelevant t cells our lead candidate has exhibited significant potential in preclinical cancer models and has shown impressive synergy when combined with checkpoint inhibitors our approach to modulating the immune system to treat disease could have great clinical benefit for patients while reducing collateral toxicities often seen with less selective immunotherapies” “cue biologics are engineered to engage and modulate specific diseaserelevant subpopulations of t cells within a patient’s body without activating t cells with similar signaling receptors that are not relevant to the disease” said steven almo phd chair of the department of biochemistry at albert einstein college of medicinemontefiore medical center scientific founder of cue and chairman of the cue scientific and clinical advisory board “the company has made impressive progress and i look forward to working closely with cue as it brings its drug candidates into the clinic and advances its growing pipeline” the cue platform was developed in dr almo’s laboratory at the albert einstein college of medicine as part of a fiveyear specialized center grant from the national institutes of health nih this funding enabled the technology to be built into an industryscale drug design platform capable of rapid and efficient molecular prototyping and development cue is leveraging these design capabilities in its discovery efforts immune responses on cue cue biopharma has developed a highly productive platform for designing biologic drugs that generate tailored immune responses from diseaserelevant t cell populations by emulating the signals or cues delivered by the body’s antigen presenting cells this approach has the potential to be highly effective both as a monotherapy and also in combination with checkpoint inhibitors while simultaneously avoiding the toxicity limitations experienced when nonspecific t cell activation is involved cue biologics are being designed to achieve a high level of specificity through the fusion of engineered t cell costimulatory signaling molecules ligands with a t cell receptor targeting complex peptidemhc on a traditional antibody scaffold the peptide interacts with diseaserelevant t cells and the biologic delivers one of cue’s engineered signaling ligands thereby enabling exclusive modulation of the t cell population of interest cue biologics are expected to be capable of eliciting targeted t cell stimulation and expansion in the context of oncology or t cell downregulation in the context of autoimmune disease the peptides capable of selectively targeting t cell subsets are interchangeable on the cue construct allowing for rapid extension to different indications simply by changing the specific peptide the versatility and flexibility of the cue platform allows for highly efficient design and development of biologics that provide a rapid path from concept to invivo validation and selection of clinical candidates cue names management team board of directors scientific advisory board in conjunction with the launch of the company cue is announcing the members of
