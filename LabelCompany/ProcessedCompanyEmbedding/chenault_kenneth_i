comment quote supports kws leadership content when kenneth chenault first came to american express more than  years ago as a young executive just off a twoandahalf year consulting stint at bain  company he looked around and saw an opportunity in the corporation’s struggling merchandising group the person overseeing that group and the rest of travel related services at the time was louis v gerstner jr who later went on to become ceo of rjr nabisco and then ibm gerstner advised chenault against getting involved with the offshoot business selling jewelry stereo equipment and other odds and ends by direct mail to american express customers in fact said gerstner he was ready to shut the whole enterprise down “‘do not take this job’ lou told me over and over” chenault now the chairman and ceo of american express said during a recent wharton leadership lecture “but i said ‘lou i want to take on a challenge’ i never shied away from taking a risk and i felt this was the way i should go” “my view is often to take on the assignments that no one else wants particularly early on in a career” –kenneth chenault as chenault started work he looked around for what he called “the best and the brightest” available to him at american express he realized that because the division was a neglected part of the corporation he would get experience in all aspects of that business “something they would never have let some yearold just out of the consulting business do otherwise my view is often to take on the assignments that no one else wants particularly early on in a career everyone wants to be in the glamorous part of a business i wanted to learn” in the two years that chenault ran merchant services it went from an albatross to a profit center its revenues more than tripling from  million to  million gerstner finally insisted chenault join the credit card side of the corporation and a leadership star was born “leadership takes many forms but one thing that is most important is to realize that change is inevitable especially in the age we live in now and that you always have to be adaptable to change” noted chenault he emphasized that american express itself was hardly a glamorous company when it started in  it was the original company henry wells william g fargo and john butterfield founded to move freight “moving freight was not a business with a lot of glamour” he said “but they instituted core values that we still hold  years later in our daytoday operations — integrity and customer commitment… it is pretty extraordinary that a freight company founded in  established a brand that remains relevant in  in the digital age” chenault took over as ceo in  after a series of jobs that he held for  years at the company it was unusual for an african american to reach the top of an american corporation but chenault has never felt his race either qualified him for a position or prevented him from getting it he said he just had confidence in himself as a leader and went about his work methodically never backbiting and always seeking advice even from executives who might have been competitors knowledgewharton high school “i really did not focus on becoming a ceo until around  years before it happened but i worked with people who could be viewed as competition and worked well with them” he stated “i had straightforward conversations with them and said ‘let us focus on what is best for the company’ i thought by doing that everything would work out for the best” when he became ceo the top  executives in the employee company all stayed on although over time some left for other positions identifying good leaders chenault described his leadership style as both simple and complex the simple part he said is that he feels he has kept his integrity that he has never tried to fool anyone and that he has been consistent in his goals to serve that traditional triumvirate of customers employees and shareholders he is constantly looking for good leaders in his company he does not evaluate whether someone is a leader until he sees who that person’s followers are “who is listening to them how many people respect him” said chenault referring to the questions he asks of young leaders in particular mostly he added that is demonstrated when someone is both decisive and compassionate chenault oversaw a restructuring of american express’s business in  as vice chairman when it became clear he would have to eliminate nearly  jobs he said decided to tell people up to  months before their actual departure date so that they would have time to adjust to the layoffs “you do what you can to be compassionate even when the news is bad” chenault said which leads to another of his leadership principles — that the leader himself has to be a team player “the point is not to just be a nice person but be effective too sometimes being a team player is using what i call constructive confrontation be courteous but push forward on what needs to be done” although chenault said he does not devalue intellect — after all he went to bowdoin college one of the nation’s best liberal arts schools and harvard law school — what he values more than iq is eq — executional quotient “a good leader wants to get it done” he said “eq is the most important thing — to have the focus to get whatever the job at hand is completed” he believes leadership can indeed be taught and while american express does not have formal leadership training chenault hopes to teach by his own example for instance he likes to not only get consultations from his higher executives but values feedback from every part of the company “i reach down to all levels any employee who sends me a question i respond it may not be  lines but something and if people know you can be approached they will come to you that creates a positive attitude about the company” several times a year he will go to different parts of the country and world and hold brown bag lunches with about  employees none of them senior executives “the physical presence of a leader is important it shows the organization no matter how large cares about its employees “i ask them only one thing that when they leave the meeting tell  people about it” he said “i don’t care if they say ‘ken is a jerk’ because at least it brings a connection it is impossible to maintain a relationship with  people but i don’t believe in the imperial ceo the best organizations create thousands of leaders” two role models chenault admires a number of leaders but pointed to two favorites nelson mandela and warren buffett the most important thing he has learned from mandela is that even when you are in a crisis you have to think about the future “here was someone in prison who came out a stronger person” noted chenault “it was not just about survival he thought about the vision of what he wanted the country to become it is hard to see anyone in modern history who came out from prison” such a hero “sometimes being a team player is using what i call constructive confrontation” –kenneth chenault he said he doesn’t admire buffett just because he owns  of american express through berkshire hathaway “he is someone who has an intellectual curiosity and is also incredibly genuine as a person” said chenault “he admits that he loves business but he also engages with people he can walk down the street in omaha or new york and will talk to people tell a joke sign a dollar bill for them he has humanity and a steel trap mind he has a nice swift way to say ‘no’ — not in a harsh way but in a way that does not waste people’s time” chenault’s favorite quote about leadership is one he attributes to napoleon “the role of a leader is to define reality and give hope” it is really difficult he said to find out the facts of a situation and to understand the ultimate implications “you have to be open and honest to find reality to get the right answers to your questions but then you have to tell the people you lead what the reasons are to be hopeful to tell them why you should inspire them “this is all easy in good times but it is a dealbreaker during challenging times and that is when you find out who the leader is” he noted “the reputations of individual leaders are truly made or lost in times of crisis you must gain loyalty by being decisive and compassionate otherwise your reputation will vanish” supports kws leadership content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to quote for personal use mla american express

during shareholder meetings he refers to him as an “excellent manager” noting his execution and longterm total returns – in a similar manner as warren refers to tony nicely of geico i’m particularly fond of kenneth’s approach to spreading employeetoemployee connections across an organization “i ask them only one thing that when they leave the meeting tell  people about it” i’d personally like to hear kenneth describe a time in his career when he was at conflict with his own eq desire for execution a time when his hands were tied either due to circumstances inside or outside of his control how did he break the cycle and move forward inevitably this will occur for many of us in the course of our careers the inspiration would be invaluable warm regards phillip cesaretti sir i am a very

school create a product in college or even start a business of any kind further his academic background is in history and law he practiced law for a few years before moving into the business world chenault joined american express in  and within a few years he had taken the reins of the troubled merchandising operations a top manager at american express louis gerstner wanted to shut down the department chenault volunteered to take it over and in two years grew the business from  million in sales to  million through the years he has climbed the corporate ladder in  he was appointed ceo and a few months later chairman chenault has guided the company through multiple crises enduring  which impacted the financial sector and reduced travel and the financial crisis of  chenault is well liked at american express according to glassdoor he holds an  approval rating his company ranks  on the  most admired list he also enjoys the respect of many of his business peers some of whom are in tech google chairman eric schmidt says chenault “exemplifies the best leadership that i’ve ever worked with” facebook’s carolyn everson says chenault is “a revered leader” and “he’s an amazing leader that sets the vision from the very top” in listening to chenault you can identify his unique traits he’s intelligent thoughtful articulate and he can clearly express his advice this post is chockfull of chenault’s advice on leadership business management and personal development chenault says that with all advice “you’ve got to personalize it and you’ve got to customize it to your own situation” so read on and learn from one of the best fortune  ceos around there’s something for anyone in any stage leaders need to define reality and give hope if you want to have an inspired workforce you need to make sure people understand you are grounded in reality you also have to give workers the strategies the ideas and the values they need to be hopeful according to chenault “i think what’s important for me about leadership and i’m really passionate about leadership because i think it’s critical no matter what you do…i follow a quote from napoleon and i always preface this with ‘i don’t want to end up like napoleon’ “but it’s a quote frankly that i think about every day because i think it’s what a leader has to do the way i paraphrase the quote is ‘the role of a leader is to define reality and give hope’ “when you think about that quote it’s very simple but if you put it in a leadership context what’s very difficult about leadership is you’ll have very wellmeaning people who will try to sometimes distort reality not intentionally but they may just tell you what you want to hear and part of your job as a leader is really to find out what the real deal is “but that’s not enough then you’ve got to put together a strategy that galvanizes people that gives them hope that they can overcome the obstacles or achieve something that they didn’t think was possible so ‘define reality and give hope’ is really what i believe is most important for a leader” chenault expands on this “a very bright person can analyze a situation and say ‘here’s the problem’…it takes a winner to say ‘here are the reasons why you should have hope here are the pragmatic reasons and here are the aspirational reasons why you should have that hope’ and i think to have a winning mentality and to be a consistent winner you’ve got to have a basis in reality and you’ve got to have the ability to in fact envision what are your objectives “so for me for our company what i said is ‘i’ve got two aspirations for the company’ i want us to be one of the most successful companies in the world a lot of people can give that aspiration…but we’ve defined it so we took our financial metrics and we said ‘how many companies have achieved those metrics over a  year period’…we looked at  companies we saw  so understand what you’re signing up for –  companies you know the odds of that happening that’s really tough that’s the aspiration “the second aspiration is that i want us to be one of the most respected and admired companies in the world i think what you want is you want people to clearly aspire but you also want them to know that you’re going to measure how you’re doing on that journey” in a conversation with sheryl sandberg chenault adds more “if you think about any organization any country and any company that’s part of what we’ve got to try to do is…define reality but then where does the inspiration come in where does the creativity come in and that’s the hope part because part of what you have to do as a leader is you’ve got to create a vision that galvanizes people you have to empower people to be change agents you have to engage in this…constructive confrontation you have to constantly attack the status quo” chenault adds that when giving hope leaders need to give people markers to let them know their progress on a very regular basis he says that during  he had to explain to the entire company the reality of the situation they were in but also give them hope for how they were going to emerge try constructive confrontation to bring out the best ideas at american express chenault wants employees to have “constructive confrontation” he says that “at any level of the organization i want people to have the ability to speak up and to speak out because that’s how we’re going to understand what reality is all about that’s how we’re going to get different perspectives so i think it’s important to have that level of constructive confrontation “however once we decide on the course of action i want everyone on the train it is not the time after we have decided on the course of action to say ‘i’m not going to go along’ that’s a problem” chenault says he’ll instigate confrontation he’ll take a view that certainly will stir things up he says “there are a lot of terrific ideas at every level of a company so you want to set up the mechanisms through every channel to spread ideas but the tone has to be set at the top that you the ceo are the type of person that people feel comfortable arguing with on issues i always then make the point however that once we decide on a course of action we can’t have people continuing to debate we need to move forward” chenault says that being direct and honest are key and even raising your voice “the more you can get people engaged and talking through the issues the better what it actually says is ‘i respect you and your ideas and the fact that you are impassioned about those ideas and you’re willing to take some risk’ because that’s what it takes in business you’ve gotta put some risk out there if you’re going to be careful then we’re not going to move forward as a company we’re not going to be a leader” he later adds that “some of the opportunities come from the biggest challenges” the four things leaders need when asked what he looks for in other people chenault says he looks for the following qualities in leaders followership do people listen to the leader do they seek his or her advice and judgment integrity is there a consistency between words and action “you can’t build a trusting relationship without integrity” integrity is the foundation of leadership courage the ability to challenge to speak out to stand up for what you think is right sense of humor “the challenges we face in life are such that it’s sometimes very good to have people around who can keep the spirits up because motivation is very important” integrity on integrity chenault says “integrity is critical because you can’t gain a followership if you’re asking people to take some risk they have to have a level of trust what’s important is the leadership behaviors and the leadership values need to be understood by the people in the company and the leader has to exemplify those values and i believe in that to my core” when hiring leaders when asking interview questions probing a candidate’s integrity chenault says a good question to ask is “what are some of the most difficult issues you’ve confronted” chenault expands in an interview chenault will say “‘take me through where you felt you had to compromise your values’ that gets people into a discussion sometimes i’ll say ‘what are your values’ people are very uncomfortable talking about their values but it is critical to understand what the leadership attributes are that person values “the second thing i look for very importantly is i want to make sure the person is intellectually curious and is open to a range of perspectives because to operate in this business environment you can’t just be a one trick pony or be a narrow thinker and so what i’ll try to do is find experiences and i’ll ask them ‘what are some of the things you have done that you think were out of your comfort zone’ “people have a different way of talking about their comfort zone but what you can start to glean is from an intellectual standpoint how open were they to different ideas and views and you can challenge them on some things and you can be contrarian and see how they will respond to that “then what is also useful is i ask them ‘if i were to talk to someone about you what would be three areas that they would cite that would be instrumental in your success’ what i often find is that it’s very revealing because people will then tell you either what they want you to hear or how they view the qualities that are most important for their success “you get a sense of whether they value followership some people will give you the list of what they did and they’ll use ‘i’ a lot and ‘this is what i did’ and ‘i had to do this’ and they don’t talk at all about what they were able to do to motivate and inspire people to accomplish the objectives” four keys to keep in mind during a company crisis as we’ve seen chenault has been able to lead and steer a company in and out of multiple crises he’s held dozens of other leadership positions including heading the merchandising operations so what advice does he give specifically for leadership in a crisis be visible “the people you lead must see how you’re doing and how you’re reacting” communicate give people assurances “you need to communicate on a consistent basis part of your job is to connect the dots” stay calm in times of crisis leaders need to stay calm they can be energetic and passionate but cannot panic he advises that you should maintain your composure that gives people a level of comfort take action take action and give direction “you cannot freeze up you can’t allow the circumstances to stop you from acting” are leaders born or made chenault believes some leaders are born but that the best leaders “are people who work at it day in and day out” he also believes that leaders can be trained and he is a believer in self empowerment “i really do believe that people can make themselves into a leader i think it’s like someone who is a natural athlete if you don’t practice if you’re not disciplined if you don’t work hard at it you’re not going to be at the top of your game so i really do believe that you can understand and work with and study how to become an outstanding leader but it means you have to have a great level of selfawareness” leadership reputation is established during times of change “today the stakes are incredibly high the need for leaders to stand for something and act from principle is more important than ever things that were acceptable five or ten years ago will today cost you your career you can make a few mistakes not a lot…a few but if your people believe that you have the right values they will tolerate a few mistakes “in fact they will stay with you they want to see that you are decisive and compassionate because you are asking people to take risks to take chances but don’t confuse compassion with a reluctance to act decisively when necessary” chenault says “there has always been a focus on the rational aspects of leadership and the intelligence required of leadership i think it’s absolutely essential but what i have seen in companies throughout my career is that if you are not clear on who you are on what it is you stand for and if you don’t have strong values you are going to run your career off a cliff” chenault adds that many people talk about leadership but few understand it he says leaders must be introspective by asking themselves questions like “what are the gaps in my leadership that i need to improve and work on” connect the dots chenault says it’s crucial for today’s leaders to be able to connect the dots “you can’t remain alone in your discipline what you’ve got to understand is how things interrelate what are the connections and then what are the relevant value drivers for your business the ability to take in a broad set of facts and knowledge and to see what the connection is to your particular business is critical “that means that at the end of the day awareness of what is going on in the world and trends and constantly saying ‘what does this development mean for my business and my customer’ because at the end of the day if you want to be a market leader and innovate you actually have to come to conclusions that most people don’t and most people don’t because they take a conventional view of what they’re working on so that ability to connect is critical” a challenge in leadership as discussed leaders need to know how to be decisive and compassionate at the same time here’s an example of how american express amex needed to do just that after  chenault saw that amex needed to change their cost structure this meant that some people had to be laid off  people over  of their workforce needless to say emotionally it was a bad time to lay people off but chenault said the future of the company may be at stake he said “we have to do this in a compassionate way with our employees but we have to do it what i believe very strongly is one of the things you gotta do in leadership is you need to tell people both the truth don’t talk down to people and explain to people the reasons why” during the layoffs amex surveyed all employees including the ones who were laid off surprisingly amex received the highest employee satisfaction in years chenault credits this to the times  and the way in which layoffs were handled he adds that many of the laid off employees have come back to and received employment through amex find mentors who give you advice and judgment chenault believes mentoring is one of the most satisfying aspects in leadership “what i really believe is that if you want to develop a true mentor relationship and you want to network you want to network off of your performance just to meet someone is generally not that helpful…here’s how the trade off works at least for me “if i’m going to take on a mentee…i want to get something in return i want to be stimulated by the ideas that they can come up with and the dialogue i want for them to have the commitment that they’re going to really improve in the areas that they need to improve on and that they’re really capable of making things happen that’s part of the trade off “i think when you look at a mentor at different levels sometimes you’re looking for someone who can give you technical advice that’s not a mentor to me that’s an expert and that’s very important to seek out that expert advice “what i look for in mentors is judgment because that to me at the end of the day from a leadership standpoint is really the toughest challenge… “i’ve had a lot of mentors in a structural sense that have been at lower levels in the company i also make this point – what you get with a mentor that is at a lower level in the company is an unfiltered perspective in the sense that they’ll tell you who the phonies are in the company and it really is amazing because they’ve been there because people take liberties with people that they don’t think are senior… “there are people at lower levels who have incredible judgment and incredible insight that are coming up through the company and they help me tremendously to say ‘at the end of the day here are some people you should stay away from because you can’t trust them for these reasons’ or ‘watch out for this situation’ or ‘you may be approaching an issue in this way here’s another way to think about it’ so i really encourage people to develop mentors at different levels of the organization” he adds in another interview “the issue is not forming a strong personal relationship that’s fine if it comes but the way to form a mentor relationship is to network off your performance you don’t want to be beholden to the mentor and have him control your life – because if something happens to him you have problems choose mentors you admire and want to emulate “look up and down in an organization for a mentor examine who seems to know what they’re doing who shows good judgment power is nice and it’s useful but in a mentor relationship judgment is more important than power” become the company that can put you out of business don’t stay in your strategy too long you may think you’ve found a groove of success but if you stay with it too long it will become a rut don’t get arrogant about success chenault says that he focuses on reinvention of the company and transformation he says “the enemy of success is the status quo what is most dangerous is sometimes when you’re successful you get comfortable and that is a big problem in business you’ve got to constantly focus on innovation” this reminds me of an andy grove quote “success breeds complacency complacency breeds failure only the paranoid survive” chenault isn’t saying to reinvent the wheel or to turn your business  degrees but rather focus on innovation he says “you constantly have to challenge your status quo and you want to reinvent or invent the company that’s going to put you out of business that has to be the focus” chenault adds that it’s critical for the company to know about innovation and change and why it’s critical to business focus on the one thing you can control – your performance when asked about the best advice he received chenault says it came from his father he told him to not make excuses and focus only on what you can control he says “if you’re going to focus on anything focus on what you can control and the only thing you can control is your performance if you think about that advice and i think about it almost every day it is a very empowering statement because what it says to a person is you can really make a difference you can make a difference off of your performance it also says that you can come up always with a lot of excuses and reasons why you can’t do something “but if you can really focus on your performance you can accomplish a great deal i want to be clear i’m not naive about the obstacles that are out there and never happen but the reality is i think particularly for our young people to understand that they actually do have more control than they may think that control is really to be focused on performance whatever they do focus on performance” don’t run away from a problem challenge or barrier figure out a way to jump over it innovations need balance and support innovation requires risk we all know that chenault says there also needs to be a balance in the company he says they also require support and there are times when employees can screw up risk taking he explains “i think it’s a balance and what i try not to do is to have all the ideas funnel up to me because there’s no way that i’m going to be able to evaluate every good idea out there so part of what you’ve got to do is  for the company overall i’ll set out areas – so i’ll give you one broad area that i said to the company five years ago “i said there’s an amazing digital transformation that is taking place this entire company is going to be involved in it here are some changes that we need to bring about and here are some areas that i want to innovate for the company… but then what you’ve got to do is you’ve got to let different groups come up with ideas what’s critical is you’ve got to in fact not only supply the funding but provide the support “every great idea that we have been able to implement in the company i can point to you areas of the company that were directly opposed to that idea so part of what i have to do is provide air cover and say ‘no that idea even though you may think it’s a risk to the company here are the rationale here are the reasons we’re going to support that idea “what’s critical is we’ve had a number of ideas particularly over the last  years come from some of our younger people in our company what’s critical is give them the support and encouragement to drive that idea “there are some big ideas that come from the top but frankly most ideas really come from all levels in a company if it’s running well but the important role of top leadership is to make sure that those ideas see some light and that people feel they have some sponsorship… i actually think if you’re really going to innovate you’re going to have some failures so what you need to make sure is you don’t punish someone for a failure “here’s where i will have issues with people – if in fact they take risks and they weren’t aware that it was even a risk so here’s my view of risk taking understand at least if it’s a small medium or large risk and i can deal with that we can talk that through but don’t after the fact tell me ‘ken i did not realize that this could have taken down the company but i don’t want you to do anything’ ie employee termination there will be a consequence rest assured there will be a consequence but to have real innovation you have to encourage risk taking” innovate in a downturn innovating more than usual in a downturn can give you a tremendous competitive advantage chenault says during downturns companies need to be on the balls of their feet he says many companies are on their heels which is why they get pushed down he says that you shouldn’t ignore the downturn and you should be focused on the short term but says “part of the job of the leader is to have that balance between the short term and the long term and the moderate term” he adds “the way you’re going to be a long term leader is through innovation” chenault expands on this in another interview “in the worst recession apple was able to demonstrate that they can drive terrific sales because they innovate “we place a very high premium on innovation we’re doing a lot of that second and here is where i think we have a tremendous advantage and i will say this publicly – i don’t think our competitors understand the importance of really providing terrific customer service… when you talk to most people every company says they want to provide good service “i will tell you in this downturn we invested in our customer service infrastructure and our people and in the training and the empathy they had for customers and what we’re seeing is the causality in customer loyalty and spending and performance is very strong but customer service is something you’ve got to manage in a very detailed way you’ve gotta have metrics across the organization and you gotta drive it” innovation in a big company so how does a big company  employees innovate how does this message come from the top of the organization on down “what you want to do is you want to really draw from what is core to your company one of the things i’ve stressed with us is we’ve started off as a freight forwarding company so we were not created in a dorm room or a garage probably a stable what we did was we transported goods from east to west and we built up a level of trust we had a focus on service “but then we moved to travelers checks to travel to payments one of the ways you drive innovation is you have to constantly reinvent yourself and you have to be willing to challenge the status quo so you can’t look at for example payments narrowly “the reality is when i talk about why we can succeed in the digital marketplace i talk about the brand i talk about the service and i talk about the information one of the things i say is that when the card was created in  it was a platform to deliver services to the business traveler “so what you’ve gotta do is you’ve gotta expand the marketplace and you’ve gotta get people to be willing and in my terms what i say is ‘try to become the company that can put you out of business’ and constantly challenge your business model but do it from the standpoint of customer needs put the customer at the center” four pieces of advice for startup entrepreneurs as a startup entrepreneur chenault says the following you need to understand the behaviors that are going to move your business forward he says that in anything you do you must have integrity it’s vital to always take a customerclient perspective “what is it that the client needs how can you make that person’s performance or their life better the reality is it always starts and finishes with the customer” his third point is that entrepreneurs need to know what competitors are doing to serve the customer what is it that they’re leaving out his final point is to focus on what makes your business unique he says this goes for both your business and personal life “at the end of the day what is your proposition because if you want to stand out people really have to see some uniqueness in the proposition that you’re putting together” the three types of meetings in all meetings you need to state your objectives up front chenault says it’s beneficial to communicate with people before the meeting and tell them what the objectives of the meeting are he says there are three types of meetings decide on a specific action – “meeting a might be to broadly discuss a strategy and i am not asking for a resolution what i’m asking for is an airing of different perspectives and viewpoints so come prepared to do that” resolve an issue – “for meeting b i may say that we have to resolve an issue come to me with different perspectives on the issue but you are accountable to give me a recommendation” garner support and constructive confrontation – “the third type of meeting is where you want to elicit support then it’s better to be direct and say ‘we’re going to have a meeting i know that there are specific concerns and issues’…many leaders don’t like to engage in what i call constructive confrontation this is where leaders say ‘we’re going to have a meeting we’re going to have a debate we’re going to argue about it here are the rules of the road for the argument and that at the end of it whether you agree or disagree we’re going to decide on a course of action and then we’re going to decide how we implement it’ he goes on to say “the more you can be upfront and give people a heads up on what is expected at the meeting the better because what i don’t want are just empty participants at a meeting i like people to be aware of what the objectives are therefore what their behaviors should be and what their accountability is for their role at the meeting ” time management so how exactly does the ceo of an  billion company spend his time and can startups learn anything from it chenault has discussed his time management he splits it up in three segments get the right talent in the company and get them in places where they most efficiently work set key priorities and objectives and monitor the progress throughout the year spend time with customers and clients to keep company externally focused here is chenault in his own words “what i try to always do in managing my time is to set a framework for how i’m going to manage the business what are the key short term and moderate term and long term issues that i need to deal with when should i make sure that the organization has the necessary context so that we can implement the actions in the best possible way “i spend a fair amount of time on making sure we’re arraying the right level of talent and the set of skills that we need to accomplish things so that range may be  where i am challenging my business leaders understanding what the skills and competencies are so that i can array them in the appropriate way “second what i try to do and i do this throughout the year is at the beginning of each year i set some of the key priorities and key objectives you gotta be flexible enough particularly in the world we live in today to make adjustments “i also believe you need to spend a good percentage of your time with customers and clients because that keeps you externally focused on the marketplace and then what you’re doing is you’re making sure your organization is outwardly focused” don’t pursue a job pursue a way of life when asked how he’s achieved his personal success chenault says “i think at the end of the day that it is a mistake simply to pursue a job instead you should pursue a way of life the opportunity for me is to make a fundamental difference in people’s lives both inside and outside the company to lead a very successful enterprise that is not just focused on achieving business success that’s a consequence of doing the right things for our employees and our customers “the challenge of operating a global company is a terrific terrific opportunity you cannot be successful as a ceo in the short moderate or long term if you don’t have a passion for what you’re doing because the challenges and the issues are so substantial that if you don’t have that passion you’re going to wilt fortunately i think i’ve got that passion” chenault puts a focus on making a difference in people’s lives and being the ceo of a company helps him fulfill that others find hobbies that they enjoy such as building and creating and they find a profession that ensures they can use their respective avocations ken chenault quotes on using your own product “you gotta eat what you cook” on adversity “you can lead people through adversity if you’re honest and you give them the context of why the actions are being taken” on the soul of a company “i think it’s very very important that a company understand what i call ‘what their soul is what their core is’ and then they’ve gotta build from that you can expand but you’ve got to understand what you stand for” on the best run companies “the best run companies…are the companies that encourage their employees to in fact selfreport and raise issues and have that type of environment” on self improvement “one of the things that i try to do really every year is think about  or  areas that i want to improve going forward in my own leadership” what people want in a leader “what i think people want from a leadership standpoint is they want a leader who is resolute who is going to say ‘this is a core priority i’ve got to reach across the aisle but these are my key objectives at the end of the day here are some principles and beliefs that i hold that are core’ people have to have a way to frame you and judge you” during times of crisis “leadership reputations are made in times of crises” on the social responsibility of businesses “business exists because society allows us to exist and in exchange for that permission to pursue profits business must behave and act in ways that protect and enhance the world we live in in other words a business exists to serve its customers and the communities in which it operates you can’t just look at the bottom line there is an impact on society that goes far beyond the products or jobs it creates” on facing reality “what you learn through different crises is the importance that you need to communicate on a consistent basis you need to be visible and i go back to define reality and give hope which is really hard for any leader is how do you define reality how do you get it from your people how do you analyze things “because most people don’t want to face reality most people want to rationalize parts of reality away but it’s not enough to analyze that you then have to give people concrete reasons to hope and the point i’d make is if they don’t trust you they’re not going to have faith in you to take the risks that you need to take” on being successful “i think to be successful in any endeavor you’ve got to have a combination of humility but you also have to have a level of confidence you need to learn from experiences you need to acquire those technical skills…i think you’ve gotta really have a belief in yourself there’s no substitute for confidence but you can’t let that lead to arrogance ” chenault says you need to have a balance in knowing what you’re good at and what you need to get better at on being passionate “what you need to decide on most importantly what i would say is what are your passions what is that you want to do then get the training to make that happen but the most important thing is to keep your confidence and to keep your balance because i think when you’re trying to break barriers it’s all about keeping balance and focus i think that the door has been opened enough…and what is absolutely critical is don’t listen to someone who will tell you ‘it’s not your time’ the reality is it is your time… you’ve got to push for those opportunities” on stepping up during times of crisis “in volatile times leaders are more closely scrutinized employees will look for constancy from their leader if you cannot step up in times of crisis you will lose credibility and followership” on your network “i try to reach outside the company and i think i put together a pretty good worldwide network of people that i check in with a fair amount online some of it on the phone some of it in person this network really brings out some different perspectives so it may not be that they give you the brilliant idea but they give you a different way of thinking about an issue that helps you come up with that idea” ken chenault tidbits to be successful in business you always have to take a little bit of risk in managers and employees don’t just be concerned about the results they get but how they get the results and how they manage people results aren’t the only issue chenault believes that corporations need to give back to the community he says “corporations exist because society allows them to exist and that’s something corporations need to understand there’s not any entitlement that corporations can exist on their own society allows us to exist there needs to be a compact with society and that means that corporations have to have a social responsibility to make a difference” chenault’s three operating principles provide superior value to the customer and clients that we serve do it in a way that achieves best in class economics everything we do should support and enhance the brand he says that it’s important to manage by principles not rules before he was ceo amex acquired many brands while chenault was an executive at amex and working his way up he went to the president and ceo and said that the businesses tied to amex don’t support the brand chenault said “we have a number of business that i believe don’t support the brand they may be good businesses but they’re not going to support and enhance our brand “we actually started a program to divest these companies it was not because i believed we’d have a financial crisis in  but i just did not believe that those businesses supported our brand i want to be clear i did not think they were bad businesses but obviously if we had owned those businesses in  let me assure you i wouldn’t be sitting here today…there was a mortgage business we had leman we would have been out of business” don’t let the job define you – “i see too many ceos who in fact over time let the job define them understand when you cease being ceo you still got to live with yourself you still got to be proud of who you are and what you’ve done” as ceo of amex chenault has been very focused on what he wants his role to be develop a global perspective it’s important to know about different cultures chenault says by taking risks you’ll be in a better situation and you’ll have a level of confidence that you can tackle the next challenge it’s also important to understand digital but that’s not enough chenault says you have to appreciate the convergence of offline and online an example of this is apple retail “the physical retail experience has changed as a result of the digital it’s not eitheror and that’s very important” find your priorities scale it up and get employees around it when you’re in high school and college you need to figure out what your core values and beliefs are you then need to find an employer who aligns with those values and beliefs chenault believes that if you can align a group’s interests and values you can have an “incredibly motivated group” you can’t shrink to greatness chenault says that some companies become too protective of their own brand so they don’t expand he gives the example of diner’s club he says amex could have become that they could have stayed in travel and entertainment and high end “how do you build that value don’t compromise it but be driven by what the customer needs are our customers had a range of spending needs and we wanted to gain scale and relevance around the world…the reality is you need to work with partners you need to expand and what you can’t do is shrink to greatness you’ve got to grow and you’ve got to use your brand to grow but you’ve got to treasure that brand because that’s your moat around your castle” in customer service hire people who like to serve people it sounds obvious but many companies don’t do it strong brands bring both a rational and emotional connection “anyone who studies brands knows the way you build the strongest brand is you have rational appeal and you have an emotional connection if you’re viewed as a company that doesn’t have that emotional connection you’re missing out on a terrific set of business opportunities but you’re also missing out on a strong brand” chenault says people make mistakes when “they use short term data to come up with long term conclusions” in leadership chenault adds that it’s critical to give people context that they can operate in they should be able to evaluate their opportunity and success they need to know what they need to learn and they need a level of feedback what’s the ultimate compliment to a leader seeing the leaders that they’ve developed chenault says that’s his proudest accomplishment people previously under him who went on to become great leaders either at other companies or with american express when asked about competition he says “don’t let yourself be defined by the competition… don’t let someone else define who you are really focus on how you can create what i call ‘a great share of mind of your customer’ because i think to have the best relationship you’ve got to be connected and you have to have what i call both a rational and emotional connection with your customer… but what i think is most important is to have the ability to drive change in your organization” about the author zach bulygo is a blogger for kissmetrics you can find him on twitter here you can also follow him on google related posts extreme leadership the need for speed how eventbrite built and scaled their marketing organization zach may   at  am the post is long but it’s filled with lots of good information and advice for just about anyone chenault sums up the napolean quote as “the role of a leader is to define reality and give hope” so the leader has to tell others what the reality of the situation is and give them hope about the future it’s difficult and few leaders are good at it american express can be a more expensive card as many of their products are targeted towards the affluent but as i mentioned it’s a very well run company that’s admired by many kim may   at  am hello  chenault is awesome i really liked all the lessons by him specially those four things which a leader must have is really appreciable this is so true because these are too much important to lead thanks kim zach may   at  pm totally agree kim it would be wise for any aspiring leader to take in chenault’s leadership advice sue may   at  pm i’m a huge believer of constructive confrontation i think there’s nothing more detrimental than someone who holds everything in and doesn’t get to express their feelings and opinions this is a great list of lessons overall zach may   at  pm this is the first time i learned about constructive confrontation i’ve never engaged in it myself but think it would be super helpful people need to be able to debate issues freely and not fear reprimand i think this is how you get the best ideas and are more able to settle things afzal may   at  am very insightful post thanks for sharing the sampled data zach may   at  pm glad you liked it afzal mac may   at  am i like the idea of having a sense of humor as one of the  great attributes of a good ceo you can be approachable and feared at the same time companies grow when employees feel good about what they are doing and the environment in which they do it zach may   at  am  to that vicki simmons sep   at  am i find the article interesting especially given the conversations i have had with american express customer service this morning after being transferred at my request to three different supervisors i asked the person for the name of the ceo their response i do not know who is the ceo we are a global organization mam i cannot possibly know everyone i asked for them to give me the name and contact information for someone in the us that could possibly have authority to make decisions versus reading off a page their response was the same i asked them if they knew their corporate values they did not so i read the values from the website to her i’m told the call was being recorded it occurred at  am cst with simone and if anyone from american express would like to contact me i am open to a conversation i will write a letter to the ceo as i am curious to hear how he would want his people to represent american express given that one of his tidbits is being successful means be willing to take a bit of a risk ann sep   at  pm i enjoyed the interview and i think mr chenault’s advice and comments are valuable however whether the customer service of amex actually follows his lead is not certain i definitely agree the customer shoukd be a major focus and many companies fail to realize this not infrequently the ceo’s ideas get lost along the way and those at the customer service level fail to provide the service necessary to keep customers happy one bad exchange with customer service can send a customer to the competition — never to return that is a risk some of his employees may not be recognizing stephanie e whitfield mar   at  pm mr ken chenault craeted the american express serve for people like me who doesn’t have a real bank account but i will be taking the ceo american express serve to court for a suit of not allowing customers to pay there bills for online bill pay and he will loose this company i am very serious i will go to every news station stating how bad of a company this is for government and federal employees to use as regular normal people has used this card diego mar   at  pm what pat feb   at  pm i’ve met ken on multiple occasions extremely bright and personable guy has a great vision for the company and is ready to roll up his sleeves and get down to business if he needs to unfortunately that’s where the leadership ends i spent many years working with and for amex and the corporate politics inside that place are at best just as bad as any other bank and in many cases much worse lots of vps with no idea how to manage svps simply pushing a balanced scorecard agenda and directors who are faced with gerstner’s old stack ranking methodology to enable favoritism in many cases the review process internally isn’t transparent at all and that’s not just a metaphor when they review employees under director level they do it in a conference room and literally black out the windows with paper the output of reviews are “here’s your rating do you accept it” if you don’t well too bad no explanation of why you received the rating you did and there’s no transparency as to who finished first and last there’s no clear goals for advancement no training for upward movement and no clear path for most technical employees so while chenault and his team of merry makers try and figure out how to cut a billion dollars in operating costsgoing to probably cut  of his workforce over two years it’s business as usual for those who are really doing the work good luck ken you’ll need it jasemin sibo jul   at  pm i was privileged to work with american express in sydney singapore and kuala lumpur offices amex is one of the most humane company i have ever come across and the calibre of the leadership team is beyond exemplary as ceo of my own startup i am applying the blue box values and leadership traits which i have internalized i will always be a supporter and brand

address american express company world financial center  vesey street th floor new york new york  httpwwwamericanexpresscom ■ one of just four african american ceos of fortune  companies in  kenneth i chenault was a leader by example and an executive who focused on performance day in day out as the head of american express company amex he reenergized his companys brand increased its market share and won back many of the merchants who had abandoned the firm because of its high fees he inspired fierce loyalty in his employees boosting morale in the aftermath of the september   terrorist attacks chenault was designated to succeed the outgoing ceo in  and officially took over the role in january  with  sales of  billion american express was a prominent financialservices firm and the worlds numberone kenneth i chenault apwide world photos  travel agency it issued travelers checks published magazines—such as food  wine and travel  leisure —and provided financialadvisory services the company had four units global corporate services global financial services global establishment services and travelers cheques and us consumer and small business services on the internet amex offered online banking and mortgage and brokerage services warren buffetts berkshire hathaway owned about  percent of the company key competitors included carlson wagonlit jtb and visa brains but little ambition as a young man chenaults immense success in corporate america could not have been predicted based on his performance early in life as a highschool student in a middleclass white community he received a slew of cs—except in history class where he typically earned as his parents knew that he was extremely intelligent but worried about whether he had the focus to maximize his potential they were certainly good role models chenaults father graduated first in his class at howard universitys dental school and his mother graduated at the top of her class at howards school of dental hygiene while he had an incessant desire to learn chenault conceded in ebony magazine with respect to his poor performance in school im sure it was frustrating for them that i was not applying myself july  chenault eventually received crucial mentoring from peter curran the head of waldorf high school—a private school in garden city new york—who encouraged the wayward student to apply himself when chenault graduated he did so with numerous honors he had been class president an honor student and the captain of the basketball soccer and track teams he enrolled in springfield college in massachusetts which had offered him a sports scholarship but craved a more academic experience and thus ended up at bowdoin college in maine motivated to make a difference at bowdoin chenault realized that he wanted to pursue a profession that would enable him to help other african americans he debated the merits of a corporate career with fellow african american students—there were  at bowdoin at the time as compared with the  white students—who warned of a lifestyle that might ultimately force him to abandon his convictions chenault disagreed believing it to be possible for an african american to succeed without selling out during these oftenheated discussions chenault displayed his aptitude for debate rasuli lewis a fellow bowdoin student who remained a friend told ebony  his style was to come in more the middle of the road to say lets consider both sides here and to look at it from the point of fact rather than emotion july  chenault had the ability to elicit respect from african american and white students alike geoffrey canada another college friend told fortune  this was a time when people wanted you to choose sides he sat with whomever he wanted what was remarkable was that he could do that and still remain in the mainstream of both worlds other people would end up being shunned by one group or the other january   landing a coveted job without an mba after graduating from bowdoin and later from harvard law school chenault spent two years in corporate law at rogers  wells and two more years at bain  company as a management consultant w mitt romney the son of former governor of michigan who had attended harvard law school with chenault and gone on to bain recruited chenault to the firm romney told ebony  ill take full credit for hiring ken although ken lacked an mba he was a natural fit for the business world he was able to process a lot of conflict and frenzy and still be able to cut through the confusion and arrive at very powerful conclusions and recommendations and then see them through to their implementation july  boosting amexs business and his stock recruited by the legendary lou gerstner in  chenault moved to american express to become a director of strategic planning in travel related services in early  he joined the companys merchandiseservices unit which sold items such as luggage tags and clocks to cardholders through direct mailings and catalogs gerstner and other amex executives actually discouraged chenault from joining the unit which lacked the platform and visibility of other divisions chenault saw the move from an entirely different perspective however if he could turn around the struggling division he thought people would notice instead of luggage tags and clocks chenault invested in biggerticket items such as electronics and home furnishings he formed partnerships with panasonic and sharp which were eager to expand the distribution channels for their recently released video recorders in just three years the divisions sales skyrocketed from  million to  million tom flood who worked under chenault from  to  remarked in fortune  the business grew so quickly and he had made such a quick impact that his stock really rose after that it put him on the map january   turning around amex by the early s chenault was overseeing most of the companys travelrelated services it was a challenging period the economy was weakened by a recession the companys card business was losing customers to visa and mastercard and merchants began protesting the high fees that they were being forced to pay amex charged a fee of  percent of every transaction while visa charged less than half that amount due to the excessive fees many merchants—including a group of boston restaurants whose collective decision was tagged as the boston fee party by local papers—eventually refused to accept the american express card chenault commented in black enterprise  the focus in the early s was frankly one of survival we were falling off a cliff but you cant stand still and say the objective is to survive in the long term you have to say that the objective is to win september   as president of the domestic consumercard division chenault was instrumental in turning around the chargecard business his many accomplishments included expanding the companys customer base beyond the affluent cardholders who paid off their balances each month signing on an impressive number of gas stations discounters and supermarkets as acceptors of the card establishing the later highly regarded membership rewards loyalty program one of the biggest—if not the biggest—rewards program on the market and striking partnerships with companies like delta airlines wherein the company expanded its lending business through the issuing of cobranded cards that allowed customers to carry balances additionally chenault reached a truce with merchants though not everyone at amex agreed with his strategy—particularly his expansion into lowerend businesses like gas stations tom ryder who rose through the ranks alongside chenault said in fortune  it was an extremely unpopular stance ken was the leader of a fairly small group that said unless we made some fundamental changes we were going to eventually get killed january   rising through the ranks based on performance chenault eventually won dissenters over gradually transforming amex from an uncompetitive obsolete company into a booming business the level of interest in the membership rewards program surprised even chenault quests for airline miles generated a surge in amex charges and the program helped amex woo new merchants as well the number accepting the card grew from  million in  to more than  million worldwide in  as amexs financial performance vaulted forward so did chenaults career in  amexs new ceo harvey golub appointed chenault as head of us travel services a title that entailed responsibility for the companys entire domestic card business and about half of its revenues together golub and chenault restructured the company generating more than  billion in savings and continued an aggressive foray into mainstream businesses in  amex signed on with walmart—an important win in the fight with visa and mastercard for market share between  and  earnings increased every year reaching  billion in  the number of american express cards issued to consumers increased from  million in  to more than  million by  in  chenault was named vice chairman and two years later he was named president and chief operating officer in april  he was named the eventual successor to golub the softer side of a leader the public undeniably wanted chenault to succeed anne busquet the president of american express relationship services noted in ebony  you would go in elevators and hear isnt it exciting about ken can you believe that ken got promoted isnt it fantastic oh i feel much better about the company now that ken is president people wrote him notes he was flooded with email there were flowers and calls from corporate and political leaders july  people inside the company looked up to chenault—even those who had competed with him for the ceo spot the intense loyalty that he generated in colleagues was a product of his lowkey caring management style rather than being afraid of their leader—as was the relationship between many subordinates and their ceos—chenaults employees enjoyed his inspiring presence the classic axiom states that leaders can lead by fear or by love chenault seemed to motivate workers to fear losing his love louise parent the executive vice president and general counsel for the company remarked in black enterprise  he is the kind of person who inspires you to want to do your best part of the reason is his example september   an african american pioneer when in january  chenault claimed the top position at american express—one of the bestknown symbols of us capitalism then with yearly sales of  billion—the prospects for african americans in corporate america had seemed dismal at general electric for example just one of the top  business units was led by an african american only two other african americans headed fortune  companies franklin raines was the ceo of fannie mae and a barry rand was the ceo of avis john o utendahl himself a highranking african american working in financial services and a close friend of chenault told fortune  when ken joined american express  years ago no one would have taken the odds that he would be ceo but as crazy as this may sound ken would have taken that bet the playing field for minorities may not be level but when ken plays he plays to win january   for his part chenault did not dwell on racial issues he understood the social significance of his appointment but wanted people to judge him based solely on his performance he commented in fortune  its a big deal i wont minimize it but i want them to say hes a terrific ceo not hes a terrific black ceo because the reasons why im ceo have nothing to do with the social significance of this breakthrough ive always been focused on performance january   a ceo stumbles early in his tenure as ceo chenault sent the message to wall street that he had not been completely prepared for the job after announcing record earnings for  several months later he shocked investors with news of a  million writeoff on some surprisingly risky assets in the companys moneymanagement division american express financial advisors chenault consequently reduced the companys junk portfolio from  percent to about  percent and decreased the risks of other investments several months later chenault caused an even bigger tremor when he announced an additional  million charge on the same portfolio secondquarter earnings sagged  percent to  million the central problem was an investment strategy in highrisk junk bonds that had been embarked upon years before chenault would have his say while no one could criticize chenault for operations that had been initiated prior to his watch critics were troubled by the fact that chenault appeared to make no effort to understand what the companys rationale at the time had been when asked in businessweek why american express would put its money into such a risky investment chenault responded by simply saying i dont know this is a strategy that was embarked upon seven or eight years ago i dont know all the rationale and philosophy october   boosting morale after september  chenault showed his true colors as ceo in the aftermath of the september   terrorist attacks on new york city on the day of the attacks chenault was stuck in salt lake city on a business trip still he was able to make his leadership felt from afar as he happened to be on the phone with a new york employee when the first plane crashed amexs headquarters were across the street from the former world trade center he asked to be transferred to security and told them to immediately evacuate everyone from the building in the hours and days that followed chenault made countless decisions that would ease the impact of the attacks on both cardholders and employees to help the former millions of dollars in late fees were forgiven and credit limits were increased in an effort to comfort the latter chenault invited his five thousand employees to new yorks paramount theater on september  for a somber meeting at that meeting he admitted that his grief had been so strong that he had needed to see a counselor he announced plans to donate  million of the companys profits to the families of amex employees who had died on september  charlene barshefsky a partner at wilmer cutler  pickering who viewed a video of the event told businessweek  the manner in which he took command the comfort and the direction he gave to what was obviously an audience in shock was of a caliber one rarely sees october   after  american express committed to keeping its headquarters downtown it was one of the first major companies to pledge their imminent return to lower manhattan chenault commented in new york voice incharlem usa  our year history is filled with defining moments—staying open during crises when others close coming through for our customers all around the world doing the right things even when it is difficult to do when we look back on this day several years from now i believe we will see it as another defining moment that marked the beginning of a new era of growth and opportunity for our company and our city may   fighting for market shares on all fronts in the first half of the s chenault continued pumping new blood into the amex brand he pushed hard for the development of the blue card a trendy fashionable card with a microchip allowing cardholders to make secure transactions online the card appealed to the muchcoveted younger demographic further increasing the companys market share chenault led amexs campaign to build links with banks changing the companys traditional policy of only issuing cards directly to consumers he sold banks on the notion that they could increase their profitability by signing on with amex because the company still took higher fees from merchants and because amex customers generally charged more money to their cards chenault said in american banker  the leverage that we had as a competitive advantage was a higher merchant discount rate june   chenaults strategy led to legal disputes with the visa and mastercard banking associations which prohibited their members from issuing amex cards in september  a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling requiring visa usa and mastercard international to abandon longheld rules prohibiting member banks from issuing cards by american express and other rivals visa and mastercard said that they would appeal the ruling while chenault announced plans to forge partnerships with even more banks by the middle of  in one of chenaults proudest accomplishments he signed tiger woods to an amex contract both chenault and woods were leading figures who happened to be african americans but whose winning appeal was truly universal see also entry on american express company in international directory of company histories  sources for further information byrne john a and heather timmons
