atlanta georgia  httpwwwupscom ■ michael eskew was an engineer with a flair for organization processes preoccupied him and his assignments as he climbed the corporate ladder at the united parcel service ups involved everything from reorganizing parking spaces to the logistics of opening service to hundreds of millions of chinese customers his hobbies included golfing but most significant for his place in history may have been his avidly reading nonfiction books because he developed exceptional writing skills that he put to use in speeches and official documents his skill at coining apt descriptions made synchronization a catchword for organizing businesses to meet the challenges at the beginning of the st century and made constructively dissatisfied a favorite of journalists for describing his management style by going out into the field and listening to what customers said they wanted he developed the michael l eskew apwide world photos  principle that global markets should be run by the desires of the end customers in transactions he was a gifted speaker eloquent and quotable who became an outstanding advocate of the globalization of business and of the free market system no development in the history of mankind has brought greater opportunity greater prosperity greater understanding and greater hope for peace in the world than democratic market trade said eskew in a speech at the town hall of los angeles april   industrial engineer in  eskew received a bs in industrial engineering from purdue university and he sought employment in his native indiana he found work with ups and was first assigned the job of redesigning parking lots so that more trucks could fit in them he next conducted timemotion studies working out the efficiency of the processes that brought parcels to through and out of ups at the time ups served only  states and was working through complex legal requirements to serve more in  ups began internal service within west germany and eskew was sent there to oversee the development of the companys business in that country in germany he learned how to coordinate aircraft and truck parcel transfers while developing the skills he would need to establish guaranteed ontime delivery to customers in  ups created ups airlines and made eskew its industrial engineering manager he organized the airlines systems to make deliveries reliable eventually creating upss next day air service which became a large part of the companys business it was during his time at ups airlines that eskew began developing his ideas for coordinating and tracking individual parcels in the s ups packed parcels randomly in its delivery trucks and drivers had to hunt through them to find which package to deliver at each address eskew eventually changed this costly procedure with supplychain management probably of greater concern for his bosses during his time at ups airlines was the selection of aircraft they trusted eskews judgment and put him in charge of buying the planes as well as of strategic planning and technology by  thanks in part to eskews efforts ups service was available in  countries and territories eskew completed the advanced management program at wharton school of business of the university of pennsylvania in  which gave him academic qualifications that may have helped him win promotions it demonstrated his dedication to management also in  ups began offering logistics management to business customers which was the beginning of its development of supplychain management services in  eskew was promoted to corporate vice president in charge of industrial engineering for ups as well as of logistics management services for clients opening the world for ups eskew was named group vice president of engineering in  he was in charge of all of upss engineering worldwide and he supervised all development and maintenance of ups sites and buildings already skilled at coordinating airline and truck pickups and deliveries eskew took on the responsibility of coordinating all of upss air and ground operations around the world he was also given accountability for making ups more environmentally friendly and under his leadership the companys engineers experimented with schemes for cutting pollution from upss vehicles including developing an engine that could run on corn oil eventually new cleaner diesel technologies won out over the other alternatives for engine design eskew focused much attention on finding ways to reduce the number of miles driven by ups trucks cars and motorcycles reasoning that fewer miles driven meant less pollution as well as savings in fuel costs in  ups grossed  billion and netted  billion up from a gross of just  billion in  a tough year followed  because in august  the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt representing about  ups employees went on strike for  days the president of the ibt ron carey was up for reelection that year and he called the strike as a way to rally union members behind him upss business suffered as a result of the strike many customers switched their business to federal express and the united states postal service usps ups had won customers by claiming greater reliability than the usps but many former customers did not return after the strike ups lost  million in revenue to their two competitors eskew was elected to the board of directors for ups in  and he found himself in charge of ups capital which provided financial services to clients upss logistics coordination enabled company loan officers to know how much inventory a client had and to use that knowledge to secure loans with the clients inventory it was a quick and efficient process that enabled businesses to get loans tailored to their immediate needs and to pay those loans back swiftly synchronized commerce in  ups created a new post especially for eskew that of executive vice president eskew remained in charge of engineering for ups and he was given new responsibilities including corporate strategic planning he also developed upss information services he vigorously pursued the companys entry into internet commerce further he took charge of the ups logistics division by being accountable for all these areas eskew had an overview of upss vast and diverse operations and saw links among them inspiring him to add freight hauling and document delivery to the companys portfolio of services and to develop a new way of coordinating his various responsibilities into what he called synchronized commerce synchronized commerce involved arranging all of upss processes so that each matched the others in perfect timing the vision for the existing system had a ups truck picking up a parcel at a given time then delivering it for sorting at exactly the time there would be space for it next it would be put on a ups aircraft just before the aircraft took off and then picked up by a truck at exactly the moment the aircraft landed finally it would be delivered at a prearranged time this process had had an enormous amount of waste in it because none of the elements had meshed with the others using the internet eskew led the development of tracking services that enabled clients and ups to know exactly where a parcel was at any given moment this system saved clients millions of dollars in inventory costs because they did not need to store property for extended periods they could arrange with ups to have what they needed delivered to them just when they needed it not earlier and manufacturers could arrange through ups to produce exactly what was needed with nothing extra for when they had buyers in  ups went public with what was then the largest initial public offering in history its shares were inflated at  apiece because speculators overestimated upss initial value as an internet company the company grossed  billion for the year when he was selected to be vice chairman in  eskew became the heir apparent to the ceo and chairman james p kelly with eskew in charge of developing upss information systems the company had spent between  billion and  billion on information technology between  and  eskew wanted to use this infrastructure to interconnect businesses around the world he wanted a small businessperson in africa to be able to discover clients on other continents through ups he reasoned that such businesspeople would then use ups to ship what they sold essential to eskews ambitions for ups was the opening of asian markets to the companys services especially mainland china he believed that world commerce was undergoing an epochal upheaval that would change how everyone did business and that globalization was an essential part of this revolution he argued publicly that the changes would be the inevitable result of a universal human aspiration to be connected to other people only elastic adaptable corporations—and people—can survive this onceinalifetime upheaval asserted eskew in a press release march   this belief led him to pursue what he called the consumerpull business model in which end customers drove the marketplace through their demands for goods which meant ups would be best served by making sure that their end customers received what they wanted when they wanted it during  eskew lobbied the united states congress and the chinese government to allow ups airlines to fly between the united states and china in a rare convergence of interests both eskew and james p hoffa the president of the ibt lobbied congress to approve the flights hoffa realized that expanding ups business into china would result in more jobs for his membership the lobbying worked china and the united states granted ups airlines air rights for the transport of american and chinese goods between the two nations in  ups grossed  billion while netting  billion eskew was paid  in salary and bonuses the next year began well for eskew and ups after years of working on the project eskew finally led ups into hauling freight using its synchronized commerce system to help manufacturers keep track of their inventories and to reduce the overhead incurred by storing unneeded items on january   ups ordered  planes from airbus for flying to asia in august kelly announced that he would retire from ups on january   and upss board of directors quickly named eskew as kellys successor although eskew noted that the world economy was flatlining depressing sales of upss services the creation of new business lines had so far enabled ups to continue growing this changed on september   when terrorists flew airliners into the world trade center in new york city destroying the buildings and killing thousands of people ive learned to stay out of the way and let our folks run the system october   eskew later explained to account for why manhattan district ups employees were able to organize themselves within a few hours after the disaster eskew and other executives had developed a corporate culture in which local managers were given the authority not only to respond to emergencies but to suspend ups rules when they needed to within hours of the attack upss tracking system accounted for all of their new york city employees and vehicles four trucks had been crushed but all employees including those who worked in the towers were accounted for and were put to work sorting parcels by hand eskew was now on top of upss worldwide operations and almost immediately began rearranging the companys services there were many ups airlines craft in the air over america when the united states government ordered all aircraft grounded the ups airplanes landed in many unexpected places their cargo far from where it was supposed to go normally at any given moment ups delivered  million parcels carrying  percent of americas gross national product making its delivery services important to the functioning of americas economic engine using the tracking systems he had helped create eskew had his employees identify parcels and reorganize delivery schedules according to the availability of ups trucks and other vehicles those packages that could be delivered on the ground within three days were given top priority eskew reasoned that the government would allow ups airlines flights within one week and that they could then quickly transport the remaining parcels to their destinations he proved to be correct meanwhile workers in upss manhattan district filled  tractor trailers with parcels that could not be delivered to seven manhattan zip codes two of the zip codes no longer existed and five others were inaccessible using its synchronized system information ups identified intended recipients who had been murdered in the attack and then tracked down people or businesses who had legitimate claims to the manhattan parcels remarkably all of them were delivered ups grossed  billion while netting  billion for the year a decline from  mostly attributable to a decrease in commerce because of the destruction of the world trade center eskew was paid  supplychain management on january   eskew became upss chairman and its ninth ceo that year the company opened an aircraft hub in the philippines to serve asia ups had spent  million on the hub and on new aircraft to serve the distant continent the company served  markets in over  nations and territories around the world eskew initiated a  million ad campaign the biggest in upss history he hoped to expand the company by offering new services to existing customers ups capital began collecting payments for business clients from their clients customers this helped clients expand their businesses which in turn meant more shipping business for ups the company put its synchronized commerce skills to good use in contracts with computer manufacturers to pick up and repair their customers broken computers with as little as a hour turnaround in addition ups managed the inventories for many clients decreasing their overhead costs in an era of mistrust of corporations because of the misdeeds of the management at enron worldcom and other companies eskew took pride in maintaining transparent corporate finances where anyone could find out where upss money was going eskew pushed hard for ups to expand its supplychain management which he believed was a  trillion global market waiting to be tapped upss strengths in shipping parcel tracking and synchronized commerce enabled it to find ways to reorganize client companies supply chains making them more efficient and enabling them to focus on their core businesses while ups took care of the delivery of supplies and the transportation of their manufactured products eskew saw this as an important service to the business world because it could enable clients expansions into new markets upss supplychain services were expected to grow  percent to  percent annually eskew became an outspoken proponent of global business and he insisted that globalization was inevitable to him globalization satisfied a basic human need to be connected to other people as well as the desire for economic opportunities and individual empowerment he believed businesses should clarify what they meant by globalization and should help people hurt by the changes in old economies wrought by globalization further he advocated regulation believing businesses should be held accountable for their actions for instance the destruction of local environments because of business activity should not be tolerated in january  ups and the ibt began negotiating a new contract the issues were common ones wages benefits and retirement funds the ibt president james p hoffa did not wish to send business to nonunion companies such as federal express but he did not wish to appear soft on upss management either the union represented  of upss  workers that  percent of the drivers owned stock in the company was a strong point for ups even so hoffa bargained hard on july   ups and the ibt agreed on a contract to be submitted for a vote to upss union members that gave them a  percent wage increase over the contracts sixyear duration in  ups invested  million to reorganize its delivery network in the united states ups airlines had  aircraft making it the ninth largest aircraft fleet in the united states and the eleventh largest in the world carrying  million parcels per day of their total of  million the company grossed  billion eskew was appointed to the presidents export council in  and in  he was elected chairman of the united stateschina business council on february   eskew submitted his written recommendations for usps reform to the committee on government reform special panel on the postal service of the united states house of representatives eskew worried about competing against a governmentsupported monopoly he argued that the usps should focus on delivering standard mail firstclass mail and periodicals and leave most other services to public competition further he wanted the usps to have financial transparency so that its spending could be tracked and made more effective that it not be allowed to use its subsidies to the detriment of private businesses and that regulators be given more authority over how it conducted business as for ups eskew wanted the company to emphasize solutions instead of products clients should be shown how ups could solve some of their problems eskew believed that ups was no longer best characterized as a delivery company but as a global commerce company because of the diverse services it offered he said that ups relied on the flow of orders the flow of goods and the flow of money how well it managed these flows would affect how much it prospered even though the companys supplychain services alone sorted  parcels per hour he still wanted each parcel to be treated as if it were the only one ups was caring for rather than as if it were one of many see also

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
