be the first to receive breaking news sign up today acute radiation syndrome  aeolus pharmaceuticals aols aeoluspharma on twitter home clinical data acute radiation syndrome acute radiation syndrome during recent years the threat of nuclear detonation on us soil has increased  the lack of effective postexposure treatments for victims experiencing acute radiation syndrome “ars” presents a serious problem for public health planners acute radiation syndrome is characterized by a series subsyndromes affecting different organs and systems in the body acute syndromes – hars radiation exposure kills rapidly dividing cells very effectively  the human body’s hematopoietic system is comprised of several different types of rapidly dividing cells that make up the immune system  after exposure to highdose radiation the numbers of these different cells drop quickly due to radiationinduced cell death  this is known as the hematopoietic subsyndrome or hars  the rapid decline in immune system cell counts leaves the patient open to severe infection  the onset of the syndrome is rapid usually within  hours after exposure and death can occur within  days hars is currently treatable using a class of drugs called granulocyte colony stimulating factors or gcsfs  gcsfs increase the production of new cells in the bone marrow allowing the immune system to be replenished  studies performed by niaid have demonstrated a significant increase in survival at high doses of radiation after the administration of gcsfs   neupogentm amgen is currently being stockpiled by barda in the strategic national stockpile under a vendormanaged supply agreement  in addition barda is funding the advanced development of leukinetm sanofi as an alternative for procurement in this class of drugs acute radiation syndrome – giars at higher doses of radiation a second subsyndrome develops in the gastrointestinal “gi” tract  the mucosal layer that lines the gut dies and is sloughed off reducing the body’s ability to absorb nutrients from food  in addition important stem cells in the gi tract are often damaged reducing the ability of the body to replenish the lining of the gut and restore normal function  onset of the syndrome is rapid usually within the first  hours and death can occur in  days there are no treatments for giars  the current standard of care is limited to supportive measures such as fluids and antibiotics there are other compounds under development for this subsyndrome with various mechanisms of action because giars is a complex syndrome it is likely that multiple drugs will be required to treat acute radiation syndrome – lungars experience with nuclear accident victims has demonstrated that patients can survive hars and giars with the administration of gcsfs and supportive care  unfortunately those patients often succumbed to respiratory failure caused by inflammation and then scarring of the lung  this is the lung subsyndrome or lungars and its effects are not apparent until two to three months after exposure lungars is characterized by a delayed onset of inflammation in the lungs called pneumonitits  this inflammation leads to the development of scar tissue called fibrosis  the combination of inflammation and scarring reduces lung function and leads to death the goal of barda in developing medical countermeasures for radiation is healthy longterm survival for as many citizens as possible  while treatment with neupogentm and supportive care can help victims survive the shortterm syndromes hars and giars longterm survival is dependent on effective treatment for lungars  there are no current treatments for lungars  aeol is the only drug under advanced development by the us government for this syndrome  we are not aware of any compounds under development that have shown efficacy in lungars when administered after exposure to acute high dose radiation latest news  aeolus announces fda fast track designation granted to aeol  for

collaboration with aeolus and under two research grants from the michael j fox foundation for parkinson’s disease aeolus has obtained worldwide exclusive licenses to develop the compounds from national jewish health and the university of colorado preclinical studies funded by the michael j fox foundation in two models of parkinson’s disease demonstrated that aeol  reduced oxidative stress and damage mitigated dopamine depletion prevented loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons the most important neuropathological feature of parkinson’s disease and improved parkinson’s diseaselike motor deficits additional studies funded by the fox foundation have shown that aeol  exhibited druglike characteristics with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile oral bioavailability metabolic stability and brain penetrance and a safety profile amenable for longterm dosing aeolus is currently working on optimization of the aeol  manufacturing process and formulation upon completion of this work indenabling safety and toxicology studies are planned to begin in the third quarter of  aeolus plans to file an ind for the treatment of patients with parkinson’s disease during the first half of  the company intends to pursue a partner with clinical development expertise in this indication to initiate clinical studies parkinsons disease is a disorder of the central nervous system that results from the loss of cells in various parts of the brain including the substantia nigra the substantia nigra cells produce dopamine which transmits signals within the brain that allow for coordination of movement loss of dopamine causes neurons to fire without normal control reducing a patient’s control of their movement it is estimated that more than one million people in the united states and five

novel compounds for use in biodefense fibrosis oncology infectious disease and diseases of the central nervous system our first compound aeol  is being developed as a medical countermeasure against the pulmonary effects of acute radiation syndrome “lungars” and the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure “deare” under a contract with the biomedical advanced research and development authority “barda” a division of the united states department of health and human services “hhs” the total value of the contract with all options is  million of which over  million has been expended to date the goal of the barda contract is fda approval for aeol  as a treatment for lungars and deare  prior to fda approval however the contract requires aeolus to file a preemergency use authorization “eua” application with the fda  an eua allows the use of unapproved drugs in cases of declared emergency  to date barda has made the majority of its purchases for the strategic national stockpile following the filing of a preemergency use authorization application the development work funded under the barda contract also supports part of the development costs for aeol  as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis “ipf”  this development program was created based upon lung protection data generated from animal studies in lungars and chemical gas lung exposure under the barda contract and a companyfunded study in the bleomycin lung fibrosis model   ipf is a chronic progressive disease of the lungs characterized by increasing scarring fibrosis of the lung tissue median survival after diagnosis is  to  years and there is no cure the development work funded under the barda contract also supports part of the development costs for aeol as a treatment for the side effects of radiation therapy for oncology  we plan to leverage the us government investment to develop aeol concurrently for use in an oncology setting aeolus also receives grant funding from the national institutes of health “nih” counteract program for development of the aeol  as a medical countermeasure against exposure to chemical gas and nerve agents  multiple animal studies in exposure to sulfur mustard and chlorine gas have demonstrated a significant survival advantage following administration of aeol   pilot studies in nerve gas exposure models have also demonstrated a survival advantage with aeol  when added to current standard of care aeol  has been tested in two phase i clinical trials with no serious adverse events reported  data have already been published showing that aeol  does not interfere with the therapeutic benefit of radiation therapy in prostate and lung cancer preclinical studies the company also has two preclinical development programs aeol  was developed from our
