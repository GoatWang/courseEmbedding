historyedit geico was founded in  by leo goodwin sr and his wife lillian goodwin to provide auto insurance directly to federal government employees and their families since  goodwin had worked for usaa an insurer which specialized in insuring only military personnel he decided to start his own company after rising as far as a civilian could go in usaas militarydominated hierarchy based on goodwins experience at usaa geicos original business model was predicated on the assumption that federal employees as a group would constitute a less risky and more financially stable pool of insureds as opposed to the general public despite the presence of the word government in its name geico has always been a private corporation not affiliated with any government organization in  the goodwins relocated geico from san antonio texas to washington dc and reincorporated the company as a dc corporation after realizing that their business model would work best in the place with the highest
