more and more product images get shared on platforms like instagram pinterest and tumblr shareiq says it can help brands understand what’s going on founder and ceo brian killen used to work as the head of strategy at marketing company acxiom and he recalled being told by a retail marketing executive “i see my pictures all over pinterest and websites and all over the globe but there’s no product information no detail i don’t know how people discovered them how do i get people to know that they can buy it from me” so he started shareiq to answer those questions while other companies like curalate and olapic have also built marketing tools around social photosharing killen said shareiq is uniquely focused on helping brands understand how their images spreading across the web and how those images are contributing to the company’s bottom line shareiq products include an analytics platform covering things like a brand’s most engaged content and the total audience reached by that content it also includes a “share tree” displaying how different users and publishers are spreading the content and data on how a brand’s performance stacks up against competitors the company also offers a tool for creating “custom audiences” of people who have seen or shared a brand’s image so if you scrolled past a photo of a cool product but had no idea how to buy it you might soon start
