gives us confidence that prp appears to be safe and tolerable when administered by iv injection at higher doses furthermore we can now presume one hundred percent of the drug has been absorbed into

cell death we are focusing on inducing cell differentiation by convincing malignant cells to stop proliferating we are encouraging them to return to do their work as a specific cell type how do common cancer therapies work common cancer therapies take advantage of the uncontrolled proliferation of the cancer cells and kill these cells by targeting the cell division machinery these therapies are effective but affect healthy cells as well particularly those with a high rate of cell turnover inducing undesirable side effects advantages of differentiation therapies over common therapies differentiation therapy does not target cell death so healthy cells within the patient will not be compromised as it happens with common therapies like chemotherapeutic drugs or gamma irradiation  differentiation therapy induces the cancer cells into the pathway of terminal differentiation and eventual senescence it acts not only against cancer cells but interestingly can turn cancer stem cells
