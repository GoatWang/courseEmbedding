this story is about cowboys headlines sports cowboys  share this story on twitter facebook email comment on this story irving — josh thomas’ career with the cowboys started with a telephone conversation that turned into a comic routinethomas from cedar hill high school thought it may have been another prank call when his phone rang saturday afternoon this time it was cowboys scouting director tom ciskowski who said ownergeneral manager jerry jones would be next on the line“josh are you there” jones asked“are you there” said thomas at a loss for wordsjones laughed told thomas the cowboys had taken him in the fifth round of the nfl draft and said that the club expected big things from him as a cornerback and special teams performer thomas was dazed“i was in disbelief that i was talking to jerry jones” said thomas the first area high school player to be drafted by the cowboys since desoto’s patrick crayton in “it was surreal”thomas took the call at the dallas home of his grandmother eva robinson she was a powerful influence on her grandson helping raise him and form his character she taught him to keep reaching for what he wantedthe home which had been thomas’ refuge had recently been restored after being ravaged by a fire he took the call from jones while in the room where he often sat and dreamed of what his draft day would be like“she has always been behind me as a backbone” thomas said of his grandmother “ i call her my angel on earth because that what she is”the call continued thomas’ remarkable journeyat cedar hill thomas volunteered to play free safety because the team had a surplus of cornerbacks including nebraskabound anthony blue thomas played well but did not attract the highlevel recruiting attention that coach joey mcguire thought he deservedthenbuffalo coach turner gill of fort worth convinced thomas to head north thomas became a starting cornerback almost as soon as he arrived on campus and held the position for four yearsthomas covered like a corner and hit like a safety he had only two interceptions in four seasons but forced five fumbles in his final three seasons the cowboys were impressed with his workouts at the scouting combine and what he showed on “dallas day” when area candidates were roadtested“we like his measurable but you also like what he’s all about” cowboys coach jason garrett said “he’s a physical corner he tackles a good combination of physical traits and also the right kind of guy”the term “right kind of guy” was a common theme throughout the draft for the cowboys garrett puts a high value on character and the cowboys sought that out four choices were team captains last season north carolina linebacker bruce carter missouri state offensive tackle david arkin east carolina wide receiver dwayne harris and georgia fullback shaun chapasthomas has been “the right kind of guy” dating to his time at cedar hill“an outstanding person” mcguire said “he was always respectful hardworking and very humble this is a great day for cedar hill it helps us because it shows the kids what can happen if you do what is asked and work toward a goal”do that and the phone will ring it did for josh thomasjosh thomasposition cornerbackcollege buffaloht wt  age hometown cedar hillnotable an aggressive defensive player thomas started  games at buffalo accumulating  pass breakups in four years as a
