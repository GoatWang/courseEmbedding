airbnb and the new gig economy by philip kushmaro businesscom  starting a business  last modified february   share this blue collar workers are finally getting in on the new gig economy in  things aren’t what they used to be major institutions and the minutiae of modern life — the latter of which includes ordering food delivery getting around town and even dating — have seen a major facelift since the turnofthecentury tech boom workers worldwide including  percent of americans in the past year alone have adapted to the prevalence of moneymaking opportunities that are specifically internet or appbased creating a substantial pool of industryspecific talent that are ready to put their skills to use the advent of the sharing economy the sharing economy often referred to as the peer economy allows people to benefit from the services offered to them via online platforms andor to provide their own offerings to be purchased or rented from the online marketplace consumers benefit from the ease of use affordable rates and access to peer reviews the giggers benefit from the access to a huge audience and a steady flow of side cash the sharing economy has democratized markets and industries largely controlled by large corporate interests allowing disruptive companies such as airbnb uber and lyft to shake things up and provide needed services at decent rates as well as opportunities for workers to take on new projects due to its emphasis on peertopeer transactions trust and communalism are strongly emphasized and championed in the sharing economy as airbnb cofounder joe gebbia explained in a  ted talk evolution of the gig economy the “ondemand” gig economy has followed in the footsteps of the original sharing economy providing opportunities for industryspecific workers to find tasks suitable to their schedules abilities and other needs such sites as fiverr and freelancercom are favored by freelance professionals and companies in need of good work with a fast turnover rate across a range of fields including but not limited to digital marketing graphic design coding and more however a new subset of the gig economy tapping into the bluecollar sector has emerged in recent years allowing the likes of hospitality professionals and manual laborers to get in on the game after all you need to rent or own a home to monetize on airbnb you need a car to be an uber or lyft driver and you need specialized education and experience to be hired as a whitecollar freelancer several companies have recognized the absence of bluecollar opportunities in this new digital economy and have set up shop to provide services for consumers and gigs for workers take londonbased xtras which allows bartenders wait staff hosts porters and promoters to view and choose daily job opportunities from each participating companys calendar of forhire events on the app the xtras app works for staff and employers alike allowing workers to find guaranteed jobs paying at least £ per hour while providing employers access to a wide pool of vetted employees there’s also there’s also managed by q a manhattanbased officecleaning and maintenance company that offers handyman work at the touch of a button the workers who are actual company employees rather than independent contractors can earn up to  per hour in addition to receiving benefits like medical and dental insurance plus a k also in new york is washclub a laundry and dry cleaning company that addresses all of the discerning modern consumer’s desires pickup and delivery the use of ecofriendly products and quick turnaround the company pays its workers  percent more than minimum wage plus commissions the transparency of bluecollar gig companies such as these encourages people to align with the company’s ethos and thus partake in that company’s initiatives for consumers and workers alike as for the future trust and communalism are key to fostering a harmony that works for worker company and consumer alike at these onsite jobs in the bluecollar gig economy the worker naturally has a closer relationship with the employer fostering a greater sense of community than is often felt with the bigger names dominating the sharing economy overall startups in the gig ecosystem are less controversial and disruptive than their householdname predecessors in the sharing economy since the former emphasizes a symbiotic relationship between the employee and employer their platforms centralize work opportunities instead of disrupting existing options for sourcing gigs eg walkins cold calls and
