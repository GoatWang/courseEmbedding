chief slams nielsen for tv measurement problems andrew wallenstein coeditorinchief awallenstein share this article linkedin email print talk bryan harawayvarietyrex shutterstock january    pm pt if nielsen isn’t going to do a good enough job accurately measuring tv to satisfy nbcuniversal the conglomerate isn’t about to stand idly by that’s the word from linda yaccarino chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships who had harsh words for the measurement giant in a keynote qa at variety entertainment summit on thursday at ces she issued a call to action for the entire industry to make their frustrations known “it’s unfair to marketers it’s unfair to content creators and it’s up to all of us in this industry to take a stand” said yaccarino “we need to reach beyond a c rating” yaccarino cited nbcu’s move last october to take cnbc business day off of nielsen as an example of the industry not having to fear negative repercussions “nothing bad happened” yaccarino noted “the sky didn’t fall the network didn’t go off the air in fact marketers love that they’ve finally got an accurate picture of their audience and there’s no reason we can’t do that across our entire industry” if nielsen’s move toward introducing a total audience measurement solution that adequately tracked viewing across platforms was supposed to satisfy nbcu yaccarino didn’t seem too impressed she cited nielsen’s expansion from  to  homes to measure wasn’t enough considering offices and bars still aren’t being monitored “yes nielsen just debuted their total audience metric but progress is slow and we have some serious questions about their methodology” said yaccarino “there’s nothing ‘total’ about that metric if you ask me” yaccarino lamented how nbc series like “blindspot” are seeing as much as  viewers in the  demo not being accounted for “and to get those totally wrong numbers i have to wait three weeks for c delivery it’s insane” she groused making matters worse is that streaming services and social platforms are winning over marketers with more datadriven products despite the fact their own ad solutions have serious problems of their own “but i get it” she said “for marketers the allure of comprehensive audience data is powerful enough to ignore all that i mean consider the alternative what does a c rating tell you anyway almost nothing age gender maybe it’s practically useless but that’s tv” nbcu has its own approach to melding content and data analytics called “vt” which stands for video technology “with vt we’re revolutionizing our data offerings to give marketers the clearest possible picture of the audience and the ability to create powerful meaningful moments with them” she said it helps that nbcu has a parent company like comcast which has a massive audience base with datarich settop boxes in their homes “comcast has  million subscribers” noted yaccarino “who do you think has the better data” nevertheless comcast data is a small comfort when the currency remains nielsen which she believes is undercounting nbcu audiences “imagine you’re a quarterback and every time you threw a touchdown it was only worth four points instead of six” vented yaccarino “that’s basically what i’m dealing with every friggin’ day” filed under ces linda yaccarinonbcuniversalnielsen want to read more articles like this one subscribe to variety today post

january   at  am awww seems like nbc is just tasting sour grapes in the programing they chosen which is not based on talent or content but more on has been celebs who aren’t doing movies anymore poor baby reply dax says january   at  pm canaries cry in a coal mine too  under reported let’s be honest more choice plus less scarcity equals peak ad rates no matter how many you cram in – viewers don’t like them  reply mike m says january   at  am a brave and more than timely list of criticisms the problem now is that they can never be addressed by nielsen the horse has bolted leaving the cart in the middle of traffic at rush hour facing the wrong way once there were problems that could be addressed everyone consumed tv via one device theoretically making a capture of reasonably accurate viewer data possible even then all manner of known issues were present where data was sampled how much when and who was actually watching at what was accurately measured as a “view” versus a channel change did all of these issues get addressed when they could have been no they didn’t we had sample sizes at best questionable in locations that were of questionable location with “sweeps” that networks micromanaged against with “loaded” episodes with special guest stars etc because the golden word became “extrapolation” we can never accurately capture all the required data but we are confident that the data we have can be accurately “modeled” to represent a fair an equal distribution of viewers at a given date and time the first dvr’s came along that recorded to dvd media and were seen as nothing more than the vcr that unit in itself threw the data readings out still further as from the first video taped tv show the fast forward button was pressed but quality was not great and vcr’s ran out of tape during shows and had to be manually programmed so it was not a huge impact then came the endless hard drive based dvr’s hd res recording and machines that capture seasons of any show whenever it records no matter how delayed the problem is now growing exponentially bigger and the original issues are still not fully addressed meanwhile enter the internet and dodgy pixilated vcr  dvr tv captures emerge and are ignored the cart rolls on the pixels disappear the resolution improves it’s still meaningless as there is no bandwidth to transmit any resolution in any meaningfully fast time and then there is and the tv world exploded silently overnight and nothing happened fast forward pun intended to today media consumption is hd digital wired wireless satellite streamed recorded downloaded live and on demand whenever and wherever you care to watch via more devices than there are delivery methods the ever increasing content choice multiplied by the vast viewing options has driven one cataclysmic change the viewer can’t watch all of what they want live so they start watching l to l to catch up more shows  l l pattern  habits take hold making live cease to matter at all l no problem haven’t seen that oh it’s good l l must watch that season now – l m… m… what does it matter when so long as i have avoided spoilers  are the ones than grew up through it all so of course they use all these new components the most symphony can prove nielsen are out by  in that demo but in truth the gap is much higher – maybe  real and higher on some very popular shows and that is today the gap grows every day as the  “new” technology millennials get older how you can still  accurately replace neilsen your show is a data source stored on a server when it is accessed once you count one twice you count two… it’s perfect it will be the only answer and it’s just a matter of time right now only netflix and amazon have that luxury for networks transitioning it’s a whole other advertiser driven story and nobody knows the shape or journey of that change in the meantime it’s great to see people like linda leading a charge to say it’s gotten as badly out of whack with reality as we’re prepared to take reply nicholas p schiavone says january   at  am “those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it” – edmund burke thank you the comment is powerful practical and principled well said well done sounds like a voice of experience and wisdom one could listen listen and learn if so inclined thought not in complete alignment on the nature of the present and future on this i agree with mike m  linda y better is possible … and necessary onwards and upwards nicholas p schiavone nicholas p schiavone llc reply nicholas p schiavone says january   at  pm i applaud the comments of linda yaccarino on behalf of nbc ad sales as nbc’s chief research officer during the ’s and the proud sixth “man” on the nbc tv network ad sales force under bob blackmore and larry hoffner the record will show that nbc research and ad sales had a record of loyal  constructive opposition to the sub par status quo media research produced by nielsen but why has there been virtually total silence for past  years from nbc research under ge and comcast not only did nbc let the congressionallymandate contam die or contam executed in a “contract” hit but it has probably made closet deals faustian bargains with key members of nielsen top management that would not know the difference between a national areaprobability sample and a “random thought” how do we explain that nielsen today is being allowed by network clients – like nbcu – to fabricate through modeling  of nielsen’s national viewing estimates forty percent that’s not scientific statistical research that’s a fantasy ride worthy of a universal theme park i am sure nbc ad sales wouldn’t accept fabricated revenue like toshiba did in their recently reported accounting scandal there is meaningful forceful resistance that leads to constructive change and there is noise and posturing that leads to nothing and worse good luck linda thank you for speaking to variety so thoughtfully about an issue that impacts all stakeholders in the marketing advertising and media industries and while you are waiting for nielsen to see the light do not forget to put your full and unqualified support behind george ivie and the media rating council mrc so that it can do what congress told it to do set minimum research standards thoroughly audit research companies through a major accounting firm and fully accredit all aspect of research used as currency in “the business”  without fear of retribution from the greedy and ignorant players in your business sincerely nicholas p schiavone

new york on thursday the central question for ad sales “it’s about the media mix” she said credit tawni bannister for the new york times after completing her first year as the head of advertising sales for nbcuniversal linda yaccarino went out to dinner with her husband to celebrateshe soon found herself crying into a bowl of shrimp scampithe problem wasn’t the food “my last name is yaccarino — i friggin’ love shrimp scampi” she said at an industry event last yearthe tears were a rare reaction to what she called the hardest year of her career when ms yaccarino started dragging an ad sales operation for television programming as varied as “sunday night football” “saturday night live” and bravo reality shows into the digital futurethings haven’t gotten any easier in the television ad world but five years later ms yaccarino  is still at it and far from weeping she has become an outspoken leader in an industry that is contending with farreaching changes in how people watch television while competing against a host of technology companies that have begun to vie for those same audiences by investing in original video content continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story ms yaccarino who oversees  billion in annual ad revenue has drawn particular attention for her vocal criticism of nielsen ratings which have long been the standard for how tv ads are bought and sold and for her use of digital properties that nbcu has either invested in or forged partnerships with like snapchat buzzfeed and apple news“linda has the ability to stay a step ahead and i think she’s done that wherever she’s been” said julie rieger the executive vice president for media at th century fox who has known ms yaccarino for more than a decade “she is in some ways the wayne gretzky of media it’s not about where the puck is — it’s about where the puck is going”as broadcast television audiences shrink and people spend more time on digital platforms ms yaccarino has reoriented herself to think of the competitive landscape as stretching beyond nbc’s rival networks to include online behemoths like facebook and google during this week’s annual ritual known as upfronts when networks trot out their biggest stars and announce new shows in an attempt to lure advertising dollars ms yaccarino will surely be promoting the fact that the nbcu universe includes more than  cable channels  online destinations and partnerships that reach to all sorts of platforms and devices photo ms yaccarino outside nbcuniversal’s headquarters on thursday credit tawni bannister for the new york times during a recent interview in her sunfilled office ms yaccarino explained the ways that marketers might use nbcu’s properties and partnerships to reach say a young busy motherfirst she wakes up and checks apple news on her phone ms yaccarino said then she might turn on the “today” show while making breakfast catch up on e on snapchat at the school dropoff and check stock prices on cnbc or sports scores during the day in the evening she’ll tune in to a show like “this is us” then end the evening watching jimmy fallon each presents a distinct marketing opportunity advertisement continue reading the main story “it’s about the media mix” she saidms yaccarino’s desk faces two flatscreen televisions mounted side by side and her office is peppered with photographs of stars like the kardashians whom she adores in part because of e’s success in marketing their reality show she’s married with two children but jokes that jack pearson the character from “this is us” will be her second husband once she figures out what to do with the first and she professes excitement for the “pinch me” moments in her job like holding business meetings with mr fallon and talking with megyn kelly about her move from fox to nbcshe has forged new relationships inviting the sales chief of a rival network to speak at an nbcu innovation event this year and teaming up with aol for automated advertising a couple of years ago — when the notion was viewed as “heresy in the tv world” ms yaccarino saidms yaccarino joined nbcu in  shortly after comcast took control she had spent more than  years at turner entertainment where she earned a reputation for selling creatively designed ad space like commercials tied to specific tv scenes and for being as ms rieger said both tough and “charming as hell” her negotiating skills earned her the nickname “the velvet hammer” a media buyer once told the wall street journalshe first oversaw sales for nbcu’s cable channels and was quickly promoted to overseeing all of the network’s ad sales a move that combined its broadcast cable and digital properties for the first timepreviously sales teams for divisions like nbc sports bravo and usa functioned independently of one another with the new structure the idea was that if buyers wanted to be on “the voice” or “sunday night football” they could also be sold on “modern family” reruns bravo shows and more providing the network with more scale and efficiencywrangling a plus person organization and  teams into doing that was the grueling part for ms yaccarino but it also forced her to grow comfortable with acting quickly in an industry where her competitors were changing by the day“her job is understanding the marketplace and how to combine the assets she has under nbcu connecting the dots between all the channels and ensuring the parent company gets as much revenue as possible” said irwin gotlieb the chairman of groupm the media investing arm of the ad giant wpp while that may occasionally make it harder for buyers he said “that’s what she does and she does it well”if that was act  of ms yaccarino’s time at nbcu she’s now ready for act “the next frontier is how do we really bring it all together in terms of linear and digital” she said tv and digital fall preview networks navigate an arena where advertisers and audiences waver between digital streaming platforms and broadcast television “imagine if the advertisingsupported ecosystem went away” she said “there would be no hulu no netflix no amazon because that’s what fuels all their content they’d have to go to  percent original and the cost for the consumer would be absolutely unaffordable so i think everyone agrees that advertisingsupported content needs to remain the main driver or the epicenter of the business we just need to figure out a way to do it respectfully to consumer behavior today” advertisement continue reading the main story ms yaccarino has found her ambitions at odds with nielsen which has faced criticism from executives over what they have called outdated measurement tactics cnbc stopped relying on nielsen ratings in  saying they weren’t properly accounting for viewing outside the home in the fall ms yaccarino said nielsen’s new product for counting viewers across traditional tv and devices like roku and smartphones was too flawed for release nielsen declined to comment for this articlein march she announced that nbcu would offer up to  billion in nonnielsen ad inventory that relies on its own audience data including settop box information from

light joe marchese who was named the head of ad sales at fox networks group last week was invited by ms yaccarino to speak at an internal nbcu event this year“it was kind of like a macy’sgimbels type of thing for her to invite a senior person from fox to come up and talk about where the industry is headed” mr marchese said but it reflects the challenges networks are facing as some viewers opt out of ads entirely through platforms like netflix while at the same time tv ratings numbers are being compared with online ad views on google and facebooktv executives have seethed in the past two years over a frequently repeated remark from sheryl sandberg facebook’s chief operating officer who said the social network has a super bowl on mobile every day in terms of the people it can reach while the size of audiences on facebook and youtube are undeniable there is fierce debate over the value of video views on such platforms particularly when the ads take up only say half of the screen or appear for a couple of seconds without sound“from a consumer experience we all know what it’s like to experience a super bowl as you have people over your home family friends or you go somewhere and you’re watching this communal experience and you’re talking about the show and you’re yelling and screaming and holding your breath and talking about the commercials” ms yaccarino said “that’s a super bowl”she held up her phone and exaggeratedly swiped the screen without breaking eye contact “does this look like a super bowl” she kept swiping “this is not a super bowl”nbc it should be noted will air the game next yearwhile much has been said about technology companies coming for tv advertising dollars ms yaccarino said the companies were “really coming for tv content” she pointed to twitter’s and amazon’s deals with the nfl and youtube’s new adsupported shows with stars like ryan seacrest and ellen degeneres“really you just can’t snap your fingers and invent that” she said of premium contentand that is why she believes her focus on aligning with tech companies and reaching a large number of people on a variety of platforms will pay dividends advertisement continue reading the main story “it’s about real audiences real people who buy stuff because they experienced your content all throughout the day” she continued “if we can do that then we can really compete with the google
