subject and early in the th century he moved to the state of ohio settling at chillicothe where he kept a tavern near which place he built the first grist mill in that part of the state later he traded the mill for four hundred acres of land here he farmed for a few years when in  he moved to boone county indiana settling on a farm on sugar creek northeast of thorntown he got a deed from old hickory for one hundred and sixty acres of land set himself to hewing down the native forest and reared a log cabin in which to rear and protect his family of ten children until  when he sold this farm and lived with his son in the fall of that year he died of erysipelas at the good ripe age of eighty years he was an honest hard working pioneer the latchstring of his cabin was always hung out for any one to pull all of his children married and raised families his son peter represented tippecanoe county in the indiana legislature in  the aged widow of thomas goldsberry died in tippecanoe county survived by ten children fiftythree grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren thomas goldsberry son of the above and father of our subject was born at harpers ferry in  he was reared a farmer and married in ross county ohio to elizabeth landsaw of that county and to them were born eight children two of whom died in infancy the remaining six were william john mary sarah jacob and susan the first three were born in ohio and the last three were born in indiana mr goldsberry in  moved to tippecanoe county indiana where sarah was born and in the fall of that year he moved to boone county and entered one hundred and eighteen acres of land in sugar creek and washington townships he cleared this and erected a hewed log house where he died august   at the age of sixty years he was a great hunter and as turkey and deer were plentiful in those early days he abundantly supplied his table he was a shoemaker by trade made a good living and was a substantial citizen he was a democrat and he and his wife were members of the methodist church in which he was a class leader and steward and he was also a liberal supporter of his church the itinerant methodist preacher of those days made his home at his house he was held in kindly esteem by all who knew him and reared a good family it might be interesting to this generation to know how greatgrandfather goldsberry came to boone county in  there were no roads at that date we must remember that johnny was a little boy at that time only about four years old and his father and grandfather came to indiana together not in the cars for there were none the story has been handed down to the family that they came in two wagons we must remember that there was quite a bunch of them the father came in an ordinary wagon drawn by two horses while the grandfather and his family were in a larger wagon drawn by two yoke of oxen the men and larger boys walked and the women and smaller children rode in the wagons when tired they did not say what road they came over for at that time there was no choice of roads they must have come to indiana over the national road as far as indianapolis then into boone county over the michigan or the indianapolis and lafayette road most probably the latter as it was in direct line towards the end of their journey neither was much of a road at that date they were merely cut outs yet full of stumps bogs and corduroy over the marsh places there were no bridges over the streams just think a bit how we travel today over nice roads in carriages automobiles traction and steam coaches going one hundred miles while they could only travel five it was slow going it took them weeks to make the journey there were no taverns when they stopped for the night they would have to build a camp fire and sleep in the wagons and on the ground or most any way to pass the night the only pleasant feature about the journey was they could have plenty of fresh meat for game was plenty along the road side and it helped to garnish many a scanty meal of coffee and bread  johnnycake at that the entire trip was full of incidents that impressed the minds of the children so that they could relate them in after years there were great difficulties to overcome in the bad roads in the fording of streams that filled the parents hearts with great anxiety lest harm would be fall them by great care and watchfulness they made the entire trip in safety and all landed at their destination in good shape it was in the spring of the year when they came to indiana when the roads are at their worst and the streams are swollen how these brave venturesome people got through seems a mystery to us in our day and age early in the fall of the same year thomas father of our hero moved back to boone county it was dryer now and the roads were better and besides there were plenty of nuts by the road side which furnished food for the stock and many a dainty feast for the young folks as well as the older we have now got the parents grandparents the uncles and aunts and the little boy into hoosierdom it will be in order to take up the story of the latter and tell how he became fullfledged and grew into manhood and became a useful citizen you see there is a lad here out of whom we are to make a man and a useful citizen in this age of boone county we are inclined to think that a boy did not have much chance in the days of little johnny goldsberry we look at our splendid farms beautiful homes good roads excellent schools luxurious churches carriages steam and trolley coaches automobiles and flying machines and we say down in our hearts that we do not see how they got along back in the woods when they did not have any of these things just think of it they did not have any telephones or telegraphs in that day or a mail oftener than once a week if mr goldsberry wanted to have a log rolling and wished his neighbors to come in and help he could not step to the telephone before breakfast and call up the whole neighborhood to come over and help a bit all of you please come at sharp  a m and we can get done in an hour or so we cant see for the life of us how they did live when they did not have any of these things why it will take johnny a whole week to go around and notify the neighbors about the log rolling and look at the hard work it will be and besides if he has to do all that work he will have no time to play ball or have any fun or good time my arent you glad that you do not have to roll logs or split wood or walk for miles through the woods to tell the folks a little word we do not see how anybody could live in the woods and do all that work hold on boys and let us tell you how johnny got his work done and at the same time grew into a good and useful man and has been able to do much good in the world where did he go to school you ask we can tell you right at the start that there was no high school in that day there was not even a grade school no brick house nor frame there was no road to go to a school house if there had been a dozen in the neighborhood he had to go through the woods sometimes wade in water half knee deep walk on logs zigzagging through the woods like a worm fence you should have seen our school house round logs clapboard roof puncheon floor or dirt a whole end for a fire place split logs without backs for seats greased paper for light no writing desks but a big lot of switches over the teachers desk to aid in getting lessons when a stimulus was needed this is a gloomy picture for a boy of our day it will help us to understand if we will look at the outcome from these adverse environments john goldsberry when a boy went to a school house of the above style to his uncle joseph caldwell he there learned to spell every word in the little bluebacked spelling book by the aid of the spelling matches held in the neighborhood he became expert as a speller and could turn down rows of boys and girls and in this way mastered the art for that day and often was the last to quit the floor he was not good in rithmetic it was not considered essential after he came to manhood he mastered enough of it in five days to fit him for the demands of his business through life at the age of fourteen he entered the business strife of life for a livelihood he received for his services twelve and onehalf cents per day for good faithful work in course of time when he could do a mans labor his wages were increased to six dollars per month at the age of twenty his father remarried so he left home and learned the carpenters trade he applied himself diligently to his business and was soon able to handle the saw chisel and mallet skillfully and commanded a wage of fifteen dollars per month and board he was now receiving a skilled mans wage and was soon able to take contracts of his own he began to make and save money at the age of thirtyone he was able to buy a farm of forty acres paying seven hundred and fifty dollars for it this was the nest egg for his home in washington township he was now in position to assume the responsibility of home building and married him a wife as stated in the opening of this sketch he added gradually to his farm until he accumulated two hundred and eighteen acres of land with clear title it is improved with substantial buildings and well tiled in religious opinion mr goldsberry was very liberal believing that everyone should be permitted to worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience in politics he was a democrat of the pure jeffersonian school in his latter days he became independent affirming that the leaders had departed from the old landmarks of jefferson he was liberal in educational matters advocating the advance of the school system and giving his children all educational advantages that the country would afford he held the office of school director for many years and built the first brick school house in washington township he was a mason member of the thorntown lodge no  he was also a member of the farmers alliance of which he was an elector for three years he was also one of the original grangers of the county thus demonstrating that he was a live coal in the community and alert to every movement that had for its object the bettering the condition of the people in  he was foreman of the grand jury which did effective work he was a man of patient industry frugal in his habits and all through his long life was faithful in all relations of life to his home his neighbors his party and his country he stood very high as a citizen a man of intelligence and knowledge and a gifted conversationalist his knowledge of affairs his wonderful memory gave to him a store house of knowledge and he could bring it to the front and put it on display at pleasure to himself and for the enlightenment and pleasure of others he was a wide reader and his mind was stored with valuable information he was a subscriber of the first newspaper published in the county the lebanon pioneer uncle john says that the first church built in washington township was a union meeting house and his mother wove cloth and sold it to pay for the sash for the windows and they had real glass for light the experience of mr goldsberry is the experience of the generation of men that laid the foundations of boone county and in fact the men that carved out the state of indiana the first fifty years in this state was a life of toil and sacrifice that period covers the settlement and largely the material development of the state the mud sills were laid the roads cut out streams bridged farms cleared school houses and churches erected orchards planted and homes established all this while the citizens were fighting fevers and malarial diseases they faced three financial disasters and fought the battles of mexico and the civil war to do this great work required just such men as john j goldsberry  men of brawn and brain  men with a spirit that dared to do  men that faced the demands of the age in which they lived in this day we say that they were uneducated we are inclined to class all as such that have not rubbed their backs against the walls of a college or men who do not have a string of big letters strung after the name their mothers gave them if this is the only sign of education then the point is well taken there may be some doubt about this the real sign of an education that is worth having is the power to know things and to be able to do things to fill your place in life and perform well your little part is proof of your qualification to be able to stand in your place through life to build a home rear a family of honorable children and faithfully discharge all your duty to the public and faithfully discharge all trusts confided upon you is the full mission of life it takes arm head and heart to do all this work well no one can say that an individual who can do this successfully is not educated many that possess what the world calls education often come short in these virtues we do not wish to be misunderstood in these reflections upon education but this rather you can not make a truly educated person all the schools in the land can not make an educated citizen this valued product can not be turned out like a factory turns out a plow or a wagon a shining perfect model it takes volition and application of the individual there are some things that can not be bought nor transmitted and an educated mind and heart is one of those precious jewels the first generation of men and women in indiana had almost no school facilities as we have them today yet we venture that there were as large a per cent of them truly educated for lifes duties and its accomplishments as there is today our grandmothers could hackle flax card wool spin flax or wool into fine thread weave the cloth cut and make it into garments burnish the furniture and floor until it would shine like hardwood finish they were experts in the culinary art and knew all the laws about sanitary and economic cooking they were skilled with the needle and could embroider and produce the most delicate fancy needle work in addition to this they knew how to doctor and kept an apothecary shop filled with pleasant sage soothing catnip and bitter boneset they could cure all the maladies and rear a regular orthodox family of ten or twelve romping boys and girls to manhood and womanhood say be real honest can our generation with all its boasted improvements of schools factories science and art do any better we can talk around the world now before breakfast and fly in the air like a bird but will we be able to walk any farther in a life time than our forebears with all these improvements how many of us are ready to start out in life to duplicate the life work of our grandparents or even our parents why is it in our day with all this improvement and the machinery that we have to produce food raiment shelter and the necessaries of life that it is more difficult to start out in life without anything and wage the battle of life life is so strenuous today that competition is feverish we have no time to be social how many would be willing to take a day off each week and go help a neighbor roll logs our venerable citizen wallace hill who was born in these woods told us with his own lips that one season he attended log rollings one day a week for over a score of weeks in succession we have no doubt but what george coulson william h millikan and james darrough each would verify the story by saying me too if we had time to interview them and what would our venerable fellow citizen isaac belles who is older than the state of indiana and will reach his one hundredth anniversary next february be able to tell us about log rollings and pioneer life we have eye witnesses and hand witnesses to these yet living among us and can testify of its truth that we have made great improvements no one will question but something has crept into our manners and customs that makes it harder to meet the demands of society than in the days of our fathers we have laid aside some of the good old customs that we should have clung to tenaciously it may be that the social fabric is a little rickety and needs a little tightening up or there may be a leak in the bag somewhere that makes all this furor about the high cost of living it might be well to look this matter over and apply some of the unutilized wisdom towards righting the defects and make things happier in our day or at least remove some of the embarrassment of our times some one has said that he who can make two blades of grass grow where only one now grows would be a great benefactor to the human family men have been trying this and have fairly succeeded would it not be equally beneficial to the happiness of man if some one would try his hand in trying to devise some way whereby the ordinary family could make one dollar go as far as two in supplying our wants there must be a device to cut down the wants or there must be some way to supply them with less money who will step out and make this needed improvement we have not time here to discuss economic ethics there is one thing that is costing us lots of money that we should look sharply into are our schools of brick and stone as successful in preparing men and women for the real battle of life as the school in the woods was this is a live question and will stir some blood when you try to solve it when it is discussed it may bring out what there was in the woods school that has been left out of the modern school system hardship was one element you know that we are trying every way to make things easy nowadays everybody is trying to find the shady side of the road and are just crazy for soft snaps mr jones will say i want to give john and mary a good education so they will not have as hard a time as i have had suppose you stop and analyze this position of mr jones and see where it will end to teach your children that they should have an easy time means that mary will be in the parlor while mrs jones is in the kitchen and john is snoozing in bed while mr jones is out feeding and building fires and doing other needed chores in a word to teach the child that it is to bear none of the burdens of life is to effeminate it and make it useless and worthless to give it this lesson at home and then send it to school to obtain an education is like going to the well after a pail of water with a big hole in the bottom of your pail long ago it was truly said that there is no excellence without great labor to develop the intellect requires more real labor than to develop the body if the body will become flabby without exercise the mind will become worse than flabby there is no royal road to wisdom if a child is started in life with the idea that it is to do nothing it will have the hardest time of mortals for it is defying god for he hath said by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat thy bread such a father would say that mary has the best teacher was ever in our school she does not have to work any the teacher kindly shows her everything we wonder what the father would say if the teacher would eat marys dinner every day and let her starve the teacher had better eat the dinner of the child than to do its thinking the best thing about the woods school was its hard work the children were always employed no time for idleness no time to play we have heard the saying all work and no play makes jack a dull boy be that as it may yet it is better than the other saying all play and no work gives the devil the advantage over jack work did not hurt john or any of the pioneers of boone it was through that schooling that they obtained the nerve and the stability of character that enabled them to so well discharge the duties of life there is not a county in the state that was so hard to develop into beautiful homes and excellent farms as boone the hard work required to accomplish this great work gave our people something better than splendid farms it gave them splendid character that for a generation has made them shine with luster to this day it is a rich heritage that has been passed from generation to generation and is evident in our citizenship to this day let us as worthy sons hold on to this virtue as we would cling to life itself work is the inspiration of the soul that keeps us from gravitating into worthlessness of all the rich heritage that has come to us there is nothing like the love of toil   submitted by amy k davis source history of boone county indiana by hon l m
