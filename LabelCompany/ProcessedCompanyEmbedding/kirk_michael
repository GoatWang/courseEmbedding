michael kirk  demb flash products  diffuser flipit demb flash products  demb flash diffuser  demb flipit michael kirk michael kirk’s first flipit experience flipit is designed to be an easytouse lowtech product right out of the package pennsylvania photographer michael kirk reports on his first experience with flipit he writes “i purchased the demb “flipit” due to recommendations on a number of photography forums i frequently read  i had a family wedding that i was attending as a guest that weekend and thought this would be a good time to try my hand at wedding photography i primarily have been shooting sports and never shot a wedding prior  i received my flip it on thursday and brought it with me to the wedding rehearsal dinner on friday evening and again to the wedding on saturday since i was not the hired pro for the wedding and was only shooting as a guest  i had no qualms about trying a new piece of equipment with no prior experience using it  i went into this never using the demb flipit not even a practice image you can take a look at my gallery of the wedding pictures i took httpwwwmlkimagessmugmugcomgalleryp  all photos were taken using the ″x  ″ flipit it is the easiest piece of equipment to use…no shadows perfect lighting  i wasam very impressed with the results and ease of use you can get instant quality results which is a big plus for anyone just starting out using flash photography” top of page kirk michael  gainesville ga  company information products resources my account talk to a db advisor  business directory ga gainesville
