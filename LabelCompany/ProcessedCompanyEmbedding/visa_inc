card shown in the ad as well as the image of the bankamericard that it replaced in midseptember  bank of america bofa launched its bankamericard credit card program in fresno california with an initial mass mailing or drop as they came to be called of  unsolicited credit cards the original idea was the brainchild of bofas inhouse product development think tank the customer services research group and its leader joseph p williams williams convinced senior bofa executives in  to let him pursue what became the worlds first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards actual working cards not mere applications to a large population williams pioneering accomplishment was that he brought about the successful implementation of the allpurpose credit card in the sense that his project was not cancelled outright not in coming up with the idea by the mids the typical middleclass american already maintained revolving credit accounts with several different merchants which was clearly inefficient and inconvenient due to the need to carry so many cards and pay so many separate bills each month the need for a unified financial instrument was already evident to the american financial services industry but no one could figure out how to do it there were already charge cards like diners club which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle and by the mids there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an allpurpose credit card however these prior attempts had been carried out by small banks which lacked the resources to make them work williams and his team studied these failures carefully and believed they could avoid replicating those banks mistakes they also studied existing revolving credit operations at sears and mobil oil to learn why they were successful fresno was selected for its population of  big enough to make a credit card work small enough to control initial startup cost bofas market share of that population  and relative isolation to control public relations damage in case the project failed visa logo used from july   to  visa logo used from august  to  visa logo used from late  to may  visa logo used since january  visa acceptance logo from early  only in certain asian american and european markets the  test at first went smoothly but then bofa panicked when it confirmed rumors that another bank was about to initiate its own drop in san francisco bofas home market by march  drops began in san francisco and sacramento by june bofa was dropping cards in los angeles by october the entire state had been saturated with over  million credit cards and bankamericard was being accepted by  merchants however the program was riddled with problems as williams who had never worked in a banks loan department had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the banks customers and he resigned in december   of accounts were delinquent not the  expected and police departments around the state were confronted by numerous incidents of the brand new crime of credit card fraud both politicians and journalists joined the general uproar against bank of america and its newfangled credit card especially when it was pointed out that the cardholder agreement held customers liable for all charges even those resulting from fraud bofa officially lost over  million on the launch of bankamericard but when the full cost of advertising and overhead was included the banks actual loss was probably around  million however after williams and some of his closest associates left bofa management realized that bankamericard was salvageable they conducted a massive effort to clean up after williams imposed proper financial controls published an open letter to  million households across the state apologizing for the credit card fraud and other issues their card raised and eventually were able to make the new financial instrument work the original goal of bofa was to offer the bankamericard product across california but in  bofa began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of california in response to a new competitor master charge now mastercard which had been created by an alliance of several other california banks to compete against bankamericard bofa itself like all other us banks at the time could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions not repealed until  over the following  years various banks licensed the card system from bank of america thus forming a network of banks backing the bankamericard system across the united states the drops of unsolicited credit cards continued unabated thanks to bofa and its licensees and competitors until they were outlawed in  but not before over  million credit cards had been distributed into the american population during the late s bofa also licensed the bankamericard program to banks in several other countries which began issuing cards with localized brand names for examplecitation needed in canada an alliance of banks including torontodominion bank canadian imperial bank of commerce royal bank of canada banque canadienne nationale and bank of nova scotia issued credit cards under the chargex name from  to  in france it was known as carte bleue blue card the logo still appears on many frenchissued visa cards today in japan the sumitomo bank issued bankamericards through the sumitomo credit service in the uk the only bankamericard issuer for some years was barclaycard the branding still exists today but is used not only on visa cards issued by barclays but on its mastercard and american express cards as well in spain until  the only issuer was banco de bilbao in  a manager at the national bank of commerce later rainier bancorp dee hock was asked to supervise that banks launch of its own licensed version of bankamericard in the pacific northwest market although bank of america had cultivated the public image that bankamericards troubled startup issues were now safely in the past hock realized that the bankamericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an ad hoc fashion for example interchange transaction issues between banks were becoming a very serious problem which had not been seen before when bank of america was the sole issuer of bankamericards hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program they promptly made him the chair of that committee after lengthy negotiations the committee led by hock was able to persuade bank of america that a bright future lay ahead for bankamericard — outside of bank of america in june  bank of america gave up control of the bankamericard program the various bankamericard issuer banks took control of the program creating national bankamericard inc nbi an independent delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing promoting and developing the bankamericard system within the united states in other words bankamericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance like its competitor master charge hock became nbis first president and ceo however bank of america retained the right to directly license bankamericard to banks outside of the united states and continued to issue and support such licenses by  licenses had been granted in  countries the international licensees soon encountered a variety of problems with their licensing programs and they hired hock as a consultant to help them restructure their relationship with bofa as he had done for the domestic licensees as a result in  the international bankcard company ibanco a multinational member corporation was founded in order to manage the international bankamericard program sample barclaycard left as issued in the uk in the ss cobranded cards were also issued by affiliates such as the cooperative bank and yorkshire bank the chargex logo right used in canada in  the directors of ibanco determined that bringing the various international networks together into a single network with a single name internationally would be in the best interests of the corporation however in many countries there was still great reluctance to issue a card associated with bank of america even though the association was entirely nominal in nature for this reason in  bankamericard barclaycard carte bleue chargex sumitomo card and all other licensees united under the new name visa which retained the distinctive blue white and gold flag nbi became visa usa and ibanco became visa internationalcitation needed the term visa was conceived by the companys founder dee hock he believed that the word was instantly recognizable in many languages in many countries and that it also denoted universal acceptancecitation needed in october  bank of america announced it was resurrecting the bankamericard brand name as the bankamericard rewards visa corporate structureedit prior to october   visa comprised four nonstock separately incorporated companies that employed  people worldwide

divisions within visa billing  finance charge methodsedit initially signed copies of sales drafts were included in each customers monthly billing statement for verification purposes—an industry practice known as country club billing by the late s however billing statements no longer contained these enclosures but rather a summary statement showing posting date purchase date reference number merchant name and the dollar amount of each purchase at the same time many issuers particularly bank of america were in the process of changing their methods of finance charge calculation initially a previous balance method was used—calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior months statement later it was decided to use average daily balance which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior months statement several years later new average daily balance—in which transactions from previous and current billing cycles were used in the calculation—was introduced by the early s many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue enhancer ipo and restructuringedit on october   visa announced that some of its businesses would be merged and become a publicly traded company visa inc under the ipo restructuring visa canada visa international and visa usa were merged

return to the site within  days or they would be fined in the amount of us per day litigation and regulatory actionsedit antitrust lawsuit by atm operatorsedit mastercard along with visa have been sued in a class action by atm operators that claims the credit card networks rules effectively fix atm access fees the suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of federal law the lawsuit was filed by the national atm council and independent operators of automated teller machines more specifically it is alleged that mastercards and visas network rules prohibit atm operators from offering lower prices for transactions over pindebit networks that are not affiliated with visa or mastercard the suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using atms limits the revenue that atmoperators earn and violates the sherman acts prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade johnathan rubin an attorney for the plaintiffs said visa and mastercard are the ringleaders organizers and enforcers of a conspiracy among us banks to fix the price of atm access fees in order to keep the competition at bay debit card swipe feesedit visa settled a  antitrust lawsuit brought by a class of us merchants including walmart for billions of dollars in  over  million class members were represented by the plaintiffs according to a website

in october  visa and mastercard reached a settlement with the us justice department in another antitrust case the companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards because interchange fees differ or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards in  the department of justice sued visa over rules prohibiting its issuing banks from doing business with american express and discover the department of justice won its case at trial in  and the verdict was upheld on appeal american express and discover filed suit as well antitrust issues in europeedit in  the european commission exempted visa’s multilateral interchange fees from article  of the ec treaty that prohibits anticompetitive arrangements however this exemption expired on december   in the united kingdom mastercard has reduced its interchange fees while it is under investigation by the office of fair trading in january  the european commission issued the results of a twoyear inquiry into the retail banking sector the report focuses on payment cards and interchange fees upon publishing the report commissioner neelie kroes said the present level of interchange fees in many of the schemes we have examined does not seem justified the report called for further study of the issue on march   the european commission opened an investigation into visas multilateral interchange fees for crossborder transactions within the eea as well as into the honor all cards rule under which merchants are required to accept all valid visabranded cardsneeds update the antitrust authorities of eu member states other than the united kingdom are also investigating mastercards and visas interchange fees for example on january   the polish office of competition and consumer protection fined twenty banks a total of pln  million about  million for jointly setting mastercards and visas interchange fees in december  visa reached a settlement with the european union in yet another antitrust case promising to reduce debit card payments to  percent of a purchase a senior official from the european central bank called for a breakup of the visamastercard duopoly by creation of a new european debit card for use in the single euro payments area sepa after visas blocking of payments to wikileaks members of the european parliament expressed concern that payments from european citizens to a european corporation could apparently be blocked by the us and called for a further reduction in the dominance of visa and mastercard in the european payment system payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litigationedit main article payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litigation on november   a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a classaction lawsuit filed in  by merchants and trade associations against visa mastercard and many credit card issuing banks the suit was filed due to price fixing and other anticompetitive trade practices employed by mastercard and visa a majority of namedclass plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement stephen neuwirth a lawyer representing home depot said “it’s so obvious visa and mastercard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given it’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the home depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal” plaintiffs allege that visa mastercard and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels in their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lowercost cards cash and checks the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a  basispoint reduction  percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months this eightmonth period would probably begin in the middle of  the total value of the settlement will be about  billion according to court filings target walmart home depot neiman marcus saks and  other plaintiffs oppose the settlement a group of large merchants including kroger walgreens and safeway have reached a separate agreement with the defendants over swipe fees the nacs for example harshly criticised the settlement and is urging its members to opt out tom robinson chairman of nacs and president of robinson oil said this proposed settlement allows the card companies to continue to dictate the prices banks charge and the rules that constrain the market including for emerging payment methods particularly mobile payments consumers and merchants ultimately will pay more as a result of this agreement — without any relief in sight josh floum general counsel for visa responded “our belief that the agreement will eventually receive final approval was strengthened today as we have said from the beginning this settlement is a fair and reasonable compromise for all parties” in january  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that any appeals against the settlement that received preliminary approval in november  would not be heard until objections to the settlement are filed and considered by the trial court in september  the practical effect of this ruling was to allow settlement notices to be sent to eligible merchants high swipe fees in polandedit very high interchange fee for visa – from every transactions final price which also includes vat in poland started discussion about legality and need for government regulations of interchange fees to avoid high costs for business which also block electronic payment market and acceptability of cards this situation also led to the birth of new methods of payment which avoid the need for gobetween middleman companies like visa or mastercard for example mobile application issued by major banks and system by big chain of discount shops or older public transport tickets buying systems confrontation with

midseptember  bank of america bofa launched its bankamericard credit card program in fresno california with an initial mass mailing or drop as they came to be called of  unsolicited credit cards the original idea was the brainchild of bofas inhouse product development think tank the customer services research group and its leader joseph p williams williams convinced senior bofa executives in  to let him pursue what became the worlds first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards actual working cards not mere applications to a large population williams pioneering accomplishment was that he brought about the successful implementation of the allpurpose credit card in the sense that his project was not cancelled outright not in coming up with the idea by the mids the typical middleclass american already maintained revolving credit accounts with several different merchants which was clearly inefficient and inconvenient due to the need to carry so many cards and pay so many separate bills each month the need for a unified financial instrument was already evident to the american financial services industry but no one could figure out how to do it there were already charge cards like diners club which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle and by the mids there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an allpurpose credit card however these prior attempts had been carried out by small banks which lacked the resources to make them work williams and his team studied these failures carefully and believed they could avoid replicating those banks mistakes they also studied existing revolving credit operations at sears and mobil oil to learn why they were successful fresno was selected for its population of  big enough to make a credit card work small enough to control initial startup cost bofas market share of that population  and relative isolation to control public relations damage in case the project failed visa logo used from july   to  visa logo used from august  to  visa logo used from late  to may  visa logo used since january  visa acceptance logo from early  only in certain asian american and european markets the  test at first went smoothly but then bofa panicked when it confirmed rumors that another bank was about to initiate its own drop in san francisco bofas home market by march  drops began in san francisco and sacramento by june bofa was dropping cards in los angeles by october the entire state had been saturated with over  million credit cards and bankamericard was being accepted by  merchants however the program was riddled with problems as williams who had never worked in a banks loan department had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the banks customers and he resigned in december   of accounts were delinquent not the  expected and police departments around the state were confronted by numerous incidents of the brand new crime of credit card fraud both politicians and journalists joined the general uproar against bank of america and its newfangled credit card especially when it was pointed out that the cardholder agreement held customers liable for all charges even those resulting from fraud bofa officially lost over  million on the launch of bankamericard but when the full cost of advertising and overhead was included the banks actual loss was probably around  million however after williams and some of his closest associates left bofa management realized that bankamericard was salvageable they conducted a massive effort to clean up after williams imposed proper financial controls published an open letter to  million households across the state apologizing for the credit card fraud and other issues their card raised and eventually were able to make the new financial instrument work the original goal of bofa was to offer the bankamericard product across california but in  bofa began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of california in response to a new competitor master charge now mastercard which had been created by an alliance of several other california banks to compete against bankamericard bofa itself like all other us banks at the time could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions not repealed until  over the following  years various banks licensed the card system from bank of america thus forming a network of banks backing the bankamericard system across the united states the drops of unsolicited credit cards continued unabated thanks to bofa and its licensees and competitors until they were outlawed in  but not before over  million credit cards had been distributed into the american population during the late s bofa also licensed the bankamericard program to banks in several other countries which began issuing cards with localized brand names for examplecitation needed in canada an alliance of banks including torontodominion bank canadian imperial bank of commerce royal bank of canada banque canadienne nationale and bank of nova scotia issued credit cards under the chargex name from  to  in france it was known as carte bleue blue card the logo still appears on many frenchissued visa cards today in japan the sumitomo bank issued bankamericards through the sumitomo credit service in the uk the only bankamericard issuer for some years was barclaycard the branding still exists today but is used not only on visa cards issued by barclays but on its mastercard and american express cards as well in spain until  the only issuer was banco de bilbao in  a manager at the national bank of commerce later rainier bancorp dee hock was asked to supervise that banks launch of its own licensed version of bankamericard in the pacific northwest market although bank of america had cultivated the public image that bankamericards troubled startup issues were now safely in the past hock realized that the bankamericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an ad hoc fashion for example interchange transaction issues between banks were becoming a very serious problem which had not been seen before when bank of america was the sole issuer of bankamericards hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program they promptly made him the chair of that committee after lengthy negotiations the committee led by hock was able to persuade bank of america that a bright future lay ahead for bankamericard — outside of bank of america in june  bank of america gave up control of the bankamericard program the various bankamericard issuer banks took control of the program creating national bankamericard inc nbi an independent delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing promoting and developing the bankamericard system within the united states in other words bankamericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance like its competitor master charge hock became nbis first president and ceo however bank of america retained the right to directly license bankamericard to banks outside of the united states and continued to issue and support such licenses by  licenses had been granted in  countries the international licensees soon encountered a variety of problems with their licensing programs and they hired hock as a consultant to help them restructure their relationship with bofa as he had done for the domestic licensees as a result in  the international bankcard company ibanco a multinational member corporation was founded in order to manage the international bankamericard program sample barclaycard left as issued in the uk in the ss cobranded cards were also issued by affiliates such as the cooperative bank and yorkshire bank the chargex logo right used in canada in  the directors of ibanco determined that bringing the various international networks together into a single network with a single name internationally would be in the best interests of the corporation however in many countries there was still great reluctance to issue a card associated with bank of america even though the association was entirely nominal in nature for this reason in  bankamericard barclaycard carte bleue chargex sumitomo card and all other licensees united under the new name visa which retained the distinctive blue white and gold flag nbi became visa usa and ibanco became visa internationalcitation needed the term visa was conceived by the companys founder dee hock he believed that the word was instantly recognizable in many languages in many countries and that it also denoted universal acceptancecitation

central and eastern europe middle east and africa cemea were divisions within visa billing  finance charge methodsedit initially signed copies of sales drafts were included in each customers monthly billing statement for verification purposes—an industry practice known as country club billing by the late s however billing statements no longer contained these enclosures but rather a summary statement showing posting date purchase date reference number merchant name and the dollar amount of each purchase at the same time many issuers particularly bank of america were in the process of changing their methods of finance charge calculation initially a previous balance method was used—calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior months statement later it was decided to use average daily balance which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior months statement several years later new average daily balance—in which transactions from previous and current billing cycles were used in the calculation—was introduced by the early s many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue enhancer ipo and restructuringedit on october   visa announced that some of its businesses would be merged and become a publicly traded company visa inc under the ipo

objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement stephen neuwirth a lawyer representing home depot said “it’s so obvious visa and mastercard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given it’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the home depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal” plaintiffs allege that visa mastercard and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels in their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lowercost cards cash and checks the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a  basispoint reduction  percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months this eightmonth period would probably begin in the

and reasonable compromise for all parties” in january  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that any appeals against the settlement that received preliminary approval in

card shown in the ad as well as the image of the bankamericard that it replaced in midseptember  bank of america bofa launched its bankamericard credit card program in fresno california with an initial mass mailing or drop as they came to be called of  unsolicited credit cards the original idea was the brainchild of bofas inhouse product development think tank the customer services research group and its leader joseph p williams williams convinced senior bofa executives in  to let him pursue what became the worlds first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards actual working cards not mere applications to a large population williams pioneering accomplishment was that he brought about the successful implementation of the allpurpose credit card in the sense that his project was not cancelled outright not in coming up with the idea by the mids the typical middleclass american already maintained revolving credit accounts with several different merchants which was clearly inefficient and inconvenient due to the need to carry so many cards and pay so many separate bills each month the need for a unified financial instrument was already evident to the american financial services industry but no one could figure out how to do it there were already charge cards like diners club which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle and by the mids there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an allpurpose credit card however these prior attempts had been carried out by small banks which lacked the resources to make them work williams and his team studied these failures carefully and believed they could avoid replicating those banks mistakes they also studied existing revolving credit operations at sears and mobil oil to learn why they were successful fresno was selected for its population of  big enough to make a credit card work small enough to control initial startup cost bofas market share of that population  and relative isolation to control public relations damage in case the project failed visa logo used from july   to  visa logo used from august  to  visa logo used from late  to may  visa logo used since january  visa acceptance logo from early  only in certain asian american and european markets the  test at first went smoothly but then bofa panicked when it confirmed rumors that another bank was about to initiate its own drop in san francisco bofas home market by march  drops began in san francisco and sacramento by june bofa was dropping cards in los angeles by october the entire state had been saturated with over  million credit cards and bankamericard was being accepted by  merchants however the program was riddled with problems as williams who had never worked in a banks loan department had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the banks customers and he resigned in december   of accounts were delinquent not the  expected and police departments around the state were confronted by numerous incidents of the brand new crime of credit card fraud both politicians and journalists joined the general uproar against bank of america and its newfangled credit card especially when it was pointed out that the cardholder agreement held customers liable for all charges even those resulting from fraud bofa officially lost over  million on the launch of bankamericard but when the full cost of advertising and overhead was included the banks actual loss was probably around  million however after williams and some of his closest associates left bofa management realized that bankamericard was salvageable they conducted a massive effort to clean up after williams imposed proper financial controls published an open letter to  million households across the state apologizing for the credit card fraud and other issues their card raised and eventually were able to make the new financial instrument work the original goal of bofa was to offer the bankamericard product across california but in  bofa began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of california in response to a new competitor master charge now mastercard which had been created by an alliance of several other california banks to compete against bankamericard bofa itself like all other us banks at the time could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions not repealed until  over the following  years various banks licensed the card system from bank of america thus forming a network of banks backing the bankamericard system across the united states the drops of unsolicited credit cards continued unabated thanks to bofa and its licensees and competitors until they were outlawed in  but not before over  million credit cards had been distributed into the american population during the late s bofa also licensed the bankamericard program to banks in several other countries which began issuing cards with localized brand names for examplecitation needed in canada an alliance of banks including torontodominion bank canadian imperial bank of commerce royal bank of canada banque canadienne nationale and bank of nova scotia issued credit cards under the chargex name from  to  in france it was known as carte bleue blue card the logo still appears on many frenchissued visa cards today in japan the sumitomo bank issued bankamericards through the sumitomo credit service in the uk the only bankamericard issuer for some years was barclaycard the branding still exists today but is used not only on visa cards issued by barclays but on its mastercard and american express cards as well in spain until  the only issuer was banco de bilbao in  a manager at the national bank of commerce later rainier bancorp dee hock was asked to supervise that banks launch of its own licensed version of bankamericard in the pacific northwest market although bank of america had cultivated the public image that bankamericards troubled startup issues were now safely in the past hock realized that the bankamericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an ad hoc fashion for example interchange transaction issues between banks were becoming a very serious problem which had not been seen before when bank of america was the sole issuer of bankamericards hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program they promptly made him the chair of that committee after lengthy negotiations the committee led by hock was able to persuade bank of america that a bright future lay ahead for bankamericard — outside of bank of america in june  bank of america gave up control of the bankamericard program the various bankamericard issuer banks took control of the program creating national bankamericard inc nbi an independent delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing promoting and developing the bankamericard system within the united states in other words bankamericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance like its competitor master charge hock became nbis first president and ceo however bank of america retained the right to directly license bankamericard to banks outside of the united states and continued to issue and support such licenses by  licenses had been granted in  countries the international licensees soon encountered a variety of problems with their licensing programs and they hired hock as a consultant to help them restructure their relationship with bofa as he had done for the domestic licensees as a result in  the international bankcard company ibanco a multinational member corporation was founded in order to manage the international bankamericard program sample barclaycard left as issued in the uk in the ss cobranded cards were also issued by affiliates such as the cooperative bank and yorkshire bank the chargex logo right used in canada in  the directors of ibanco determined that bringing the various international networks together into a single network with a single name internationally would be in the best interests of the corporation however in many countries there was still great reluctance to issue a card associated with bank of america even though the association was entirely nominal in nature for this reason in  bankamericard barclaycard carte bleue chargex sumitomo card and all other licensees united under the new name visa which retained the distinctive blue white and gold flag nbi became visa usa and ibanco became visa internationalcitation needed the term visa was conceived by the companys founder dee hock he believed that the word was instantly recognizable in many languages in many countries and that it also denoted universal acceptancecitation needed in october  bank of america announced it was resurrecting the

divisions within visa billing  finance charge methodsedit initially signed copies of sales drafts were included in each customers monthly billing statement for verification purposes—an industry practice known as country club billing by the late s however billing statements no longer contained these enclosures but rather a summary statement showing posting date purchase date reference number merchant name and the dollar amount of each purchase at the same time many issuers particularly bank of america were in the process of changing their methods of finance charge calculation initially a previous balance method was used—calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior months statement later it was decided to use average daily balance which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior months statement several years later new average daily balance—in which transactions from previous and current billing cycles were used in the calculation—was introduced by the early s many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue enhancer ipo and restructuringedit on

sued in a class action by atm operators that claims the credit card networks rules effectively fix atm access fees the suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of federal law the lawsuit was filed by the national atm council and independent operators of automated teller machines more specifically it is alleged that mastercards and visas network rules prohibit atm operators from offering lower prices for transactions over pindebit networks that are not affiliated with visa or mastercard the suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using atms limits the revenue that atmoperators earn and violates the sherman acts prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade johnathan rubin an attorney for the plaintiffs said visa and mastercard are the ringleaders organizers and enforcers of a conspiracy among us banks to fix the price of atm access fees in order to keep the competition at bay debit card swipe feesedit visa

in october  visa and mastercard reached a settlement with the us justice department in another antitrust case the companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards because interchange fees differ or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards in  the department of justice sued visa over rules prohibiting its issuing banks from doing business with

in  the european commission exempted visa’s multilateral interchange fees from article  of the ec treaty that prohibits anticompetitive arrangements however this exemption expired on december   in the united kingdom mastercard has reduced its interchange fees while it is under investigation by the office of fair trading in january  the european commission issued the results of a twoyear inquiry into the retail banking sector the report focuses on payment cards and interchange fees upon publishing the report commissioner neelie kroes said the present level of interchange fees in many of the schemes we have examined does not seem justified the report called for further study of the issue on march   the european commission opened an investigation into visas multilateral interchange fees for crossborder transactions within the eea as well as into the honor all cards rule under which merchants are required to accept all valid visabranded cardsneeds update the antitrust authorities of eu member states other than the united kingdom are also investigating mastercards and visas interchange fees for example on january   the polish office of competition and consumer protection fined twenty banks a total of pln  million about  million for jointly setting mastercards and visas interchange fees in december  visa reached a settlement with the european union in yet another antitrust

debit card for use in the single euro payments area sepa after visas blocking of payments to wikileaks members of the european parliament expressed concern that payments from european citizens to a european corporation could apparently be blocked by the us and called for a further reduction in the dominance of visa and mastercard in the european payment system payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litigationedit main article payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litigation on november   a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a classaction lawsuit filed in  by merchants and trade associations against visa mastercard and many credit card issuing banks the suit was filed due to price fixing and other anticompetitive trade practices employed by mastercard and visa a majority of namedclass plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement stephen neuwirth a lawyer representing home depot said “it’s so obvious visa and mastercard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given it’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the home depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal” plaintiffs allege that visa mastercard and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels in their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lowercost cards cash and checks the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a  basispoint reduction  percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months this eightmonth period would probably begin in the middle of  the total value of the settlement will be about  billion according to court filings target walmart home depot neiman marcus saks and  other plaintiffs oppose the settlement a group of large merchants including kroger walgreens and safeway have reached a separate agreement with the defendants over swipe fees the nacs for example harshly criticised the settlement and is urging its members to opt out tom robinson chairman of nacs and president of robinson oil said this proposed settlement allows the card companies to continue to dictate the prices banks charge and the rules that constrain the market including for emerging payment methods particularly mobile payments consumers and merchants ultimately will pay more as a result of this agreement — without any relief in sight josh floum general counsel for visa responded “our belief that the agreement will eventually receive final approval was strengthened today as we have said from the beginning this settlement is a fair and reasonable compromise for all parties” in january  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that any appeals against the settlement that received preliminary approval in november  would not be heard until objections to the settlement are filed and considered by the trial court in september  the practical effect of this ruling was to allow settlement notices to be sent to eligible merchants high swipe fees in polandedit very high interchange fee for visa – from every transactions final price which also includes vat in poland started discussion about legality and need for government regulations of interchange fees to avoid high

midseptember  bank of america bofa launched its bankamericard credit card program in fresno california with an initial mass mailing or drop as they came to be called of  unsolicited credit cards the original idea was the brainchild of bofas inhouse product development think tank the customer services research group and its leader joseph p williams williams convinced senior bofa executives in  to let him pursue what became the worlds first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards actual working cards not mere applications to a large population williams pioneering accomplishment was that he brought about the successful implementation of the allpurpose credit card in the sense that his project was not cancelled outright not in coming up with the idea by the mids the typical middleclass american already maintained revolving credit accounts with several different merchants which was clearly inefficient and inconvenient due to the need to carry so many cards and pay so many separate bills each month the need for a unified financial instrument was already evident to the american financial services industry but no one could figure out how to do it there were already charge cards like diners club which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle and by the mids there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an allpurpose credit card however these prior attempts had been carried out by small banks which lacked the resources to make them work williams and his team studied these failures carefully and believed they could avoid replicating those banks mistakes they also studied existing revolving credit operations at sears and mobil oil to learn why they were successful fresno was selected for its population of  big enough to make a credit card work small enough to control initial startup cost bofas market share of that population  and relative isolation to control public relations damage in case the project failed visa logo used from july   to  visa logo used from august  to  visa logo used from late  to may  visa logo used since january  visa acceptance logo from early  only in certain asian american and european markets the  test at first went smoothly but then bofa panicked when it confirmed rumors that another bank was about to initiate its own drop in san francisco bofas home market by march  drops began in san francisco and sacramento by june bofa was dropping cards in los angeles by october the entire state had been saturated with over  million credit cards and bankamericard was being accepted by  merchants however the program was riddled with problems as williams who had never worked in a banks loan department had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the banks customers and he resigned in december   of accounts were delinquent not the  expected and police departments around the state were confronted by numerous incidents of the brand new crime of credit card fraud both politicians and journalists joined the general uproar against bank of america and its newfangled credit card especially when it was pointed out that the cardholder agreement held customers liable for all charges even those resulting from fraud bofa officially lost over  million on the launch of bankamericard but when the full cost of advertising and overhead was included the banks actual loss was probably around  million however after williams and some of his closest associates left bofa management realized that bankamericard was salvageable they conducted a massive effort to clean up after williams imposed proper financial controls published an open letter to  million households across the state apologizing for the credit card fraud and other issues their card raised and eventually were able to make the new financial instrument work the original goal of bofa was to offer the bankamericard product across california but in  bofa began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of california in response to a new competitor master charge now mastercard which had been created by an alliance of several other california banks to compete against bankamericard bofa itself like all other us banks at the time could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions not repealed until  over the following  years various banks licensed the card system from bank of america thus forming a network of banks backing the bankamericard system across the united states the drops of unsolicited credit cards continued unabated thanks to bofa and its licensees and competitors until they were outlawed in  but not before over  million credit cards had been distributed into the american population during the late s bofa also licensed the bankamericard program to banks in several other countries which began issuing cards with localized brand names for examplecitation needed in canada an alliance of banks including torontodominion bank canadian imperial bank of commerce royal bank of canada banque canadienne nationale and bank of nova scotia issued credit cards under the chargex name from  to  in france it was known as carte bleue blue card the logo still appears on many frenchissued visa cards today in japan the sumitomo bank issued bankamericards through the sumitomo credit service in the uk the only bankamericard issuer for some years was barclaycard the branding still exists today but is used not only on visa cards issued by barclays but on its mastercard and american express cards as well in spain until  the only issuer was banco de bilbao in  a manager at the national bank of commerce later rainier bancorp dee hock was asked to supervise that banks launch of its own licensed version of bankamericard in the pacific northwest market although bank of america had cultivated the public image that bankamericards troubled startup issues were now safely in the past hock realized that the bankamericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an ad hoc fashion for example interchange transaction issues between banks were becoming a very serious problem which had not been seen before when bank of america was the sole issuer of bankamericards hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program they promptly made him the chair of that committee after lengthy negotiations the committee led by hock was able to persuade bank of america that a bright future lay ahead for bankamericard — outside of bank of america in june  bank of america gave up control of the bankamericard program the various bankamericard issuer banks took control of the program creating national bankamericard inc nbi an independent delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing promoting and developing the bankamericard system within the united states in other words bankamericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance like its competitor master charge hock became nbis first president and ceo however bank of america retained the right to directly license bankamericard to banks outside of the united states and continued to issue and support such licenses by  licenses had been granted in  countries the international licensees soon encountered a variety of problems with their licensing programs and they hired hock as a consultant to help them restructure their relationship with bofa as he had done for the domestic licensees as a result in  the international bankcard company ibanco a multinational member corporation was founded in order to manage the international bankamericard program sample barclaycard left as

mastercard the suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using atms limits the revenue that atmoperators earn and violates the sherman acts prohibition against

litigation on november   a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a classaction lawsuit filed in  by merchants and trade associations against visa mastercard and many credit card issuing banks the suit was filed due to price fixing and other anticompetitive trade practices employed by mastercard and visa a majority of namedclass plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement stephen neuwirth a lawyer representing home depot said “it’s so obvious visa and mastercard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given it’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the home depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal” plaintiffs allege that visa mastercard and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels in their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lowercost cards cash and checks the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a  basispoint reduction  percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months this eightmonth period would probably begin in the middle of  the total value of the settlement will be about  billion according to court filings target walmart home depot neiman marcus saks and  other plaintiffs oppose the settlement a group of large merchants including kroger walgreens and safeway have reached a separate agreement with the defendants over swipe fees the nacs for example harshly criticised the settlement and is urging its members to opt out tom robinson chairman of nacs and president of robinson oil said this proposed settlement allows the card companies to continue to dictate the prices banks charge and the rules that constrain the market including for emerging payment methods particularly mobile payments consumers and merchants ultimately will pay more as a result of this agreement — without any relief in sight josh floum general counsel for visa responded “our belief that the agreement will eventually receive final approval was strengthened today as we have said from the beginning this settlement is a fair and reasonable compromise for all parties” in january  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that any appeals against the settlement that received preliminary approval in november  would not be heard until objections to the settlement are filed and considered by the trial court in september  the practical effect of this ruling was to allow settlement notices to be sent

card shown in the ad as well as the image of the bankamericard that it replaced in midseptember  bank of america bofa launched its bankamericard credit card program in fresno california with an initial mass mailing or drop as they came to be called of  unsolicited credit cards the original idea was the brainchild of bofas inhouse product development think tank the customer services research group and its leader joseph p williams williams convinced senior bofa executives in  to let him pursue what became the worlds first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards actual working cards not mere applications to a large population williams pioneering accomplishment was that he brought about the successful implementation of the allpurpose credit card in the sense that his project was not cancelled outright not in coming up with the idea by the mids the typical middleclass american already maintained revolving credit accounts with several different merchants which was clearly inefficient and inconvenient due to the need to carry so many cards and pay so many separate bills each month the need for a unified financial instrument was already evident to the american financial services industry but no one could figure out how to do it there were already charge cards like diners club which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle and by the mids there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an allpurpose credit card however these prior attempts had been carried out by small banks which lacked the resources to make them work williams and his team studied these failures carefully and believed they could avoid replicating those banks mistakes they also studied existing revolving credit operations at sears and mobil oil to learn why they were successful fresno was selected for its population of  big enough to make a credit card work small enough to control initial startup cost bofas market share of that population  and relative isolation to control public relations damage in case the project failed visa logo used from july   to  visa logo used from august  to  visa logo used from late  to may  visa logo used since january  visa

over  million credit cards and bankamericard was being accepted by  merchants however the program was riddled with problems as williams who had never worked in a banks loan department had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the banks customers and he resigned in december   of accounts were delinquent not the  expected and police departments around the state were confronted by numerous incidents of the brand new crime of credit card fraud both politicians and journalists joined the general uproar against bank of america and its newfangled credit card especially when it was pointed out that the cardholder agreement held customers liable for all charges even those resulting from fraud bofa officially lost over  million on the launch of bankamericard but when the full cost of advertising and overhead was included the banks actual loss was probably around  million however after williams and some of his closest associates left bofa management realized that bankamericard was salvageable they conducted a massive effort to clean up after williams imposed proper financial controls published an open letter to  million households across the state apologizing for the credit card fraud and other issues their card raised and eventually were able to make the new financial instrument work the original goal of bofa was to offer the bankamericard product across california but in  bofa began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of california in response to a new competitor master charge now mastercard which had been created by an alliance of several other california banks to compete against bankamericard bofa itself like all other us banks at the time could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions not repealed until  over the following  years various banks licensed the card system from bank of america thus forming a network of banks backing the bankamericard system across the united states the drops of unsolicited credit cards continued unabated thanks to bofa and its licensees and competitors until they were outlawed in  but not before over  million credit cards had been distributed into the american population during the late s bofa also licensed the bankamericard program to banks in several other countries which began issuing cards with localized brand names for examplecitation needed in canada an alliance of banks including torontodominion bank canadian imperial bank of commerce royal bank of canada banque canadienne nationale and bank of nova scotia issued credit cards under the chargex name from  to  in france it was known as carte bleue blue card the logo still appears on many frenchissued visa cards today in japan the sumitomo bank issued bankamericards through the sumitomo credit service in the uk the only bankamericard issuer for some years was barclaycard the branding still exists today but is used not only on visa cards issued by barclays but on its mastercard and american express cards as well in spain until  the only issuer was banco de bilbao in  a manager at the national bank of commerce later rainier bancorp dee hock was asked to supervise that banks launch of its own licensed version of bankamericard in the pacific northwest market although bank of america had cultivated the public image that bankamericards troubled startup issues were now safely in the past hock realized that the bankamericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an ad hoc fashion for example interchange transaction issues between banks were becoming a very serious problem which had not been seen before when bank of america was the sole issuer of bankamericards hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program they promptly made him the chair of that committee after lengthy negotiations the committee led by hock was able to persuade bank of america that a bright future lay ahead for bankamericard — outside of bank of america in june  bank of america gave up control of the bankamericard program the various bankamericard issuer banks took control of the program creating national bankamericard inc nbi an independent delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing promoting and developing the bankamericard system within the united states in other words bankamericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance like its competitor master charge hock became nbis first president and ceo however bank of america retained the right to directly license bankamericard to banks outside of the united states and continued to issue and support such licenses by  licenses had been granted in  countries the international licensees soon encountered a variety of problems with their licensing programs and they hired hock as a consultant to help them restructure their relationship with bofa as he had done for the domestic licensees as a result in  the international bankcard company ibanco a multinational member corporation was founded in order to manage the international bankamericard program sample barclaycard left as issued in the uk in the ss cobranded cards were also issued by affiliates such as the cooperative bank and yorkshire bank the chargex logo right used in canada in  the directors of ibanco determined that bringing the various international networks together into a single network with a single name internationally would be in the best interests of the corporation however in many countries there was still great reluctance to issue a card associated with bank of america even though the association was entirely nominal in nature for this reason in  bankamericard barclaycard carte bleue chargex sumitomo card and all other licensees united under the new name visa which retained the distinctive blue white and gold flag nbi became visa usa and ibanco became visa internationalcitation needed the term visa was conceived by the companys founder dee hock he believed that

divisions within visa billing  finance charge methodsedit initially signed copies of sales drafts were included in each customers monthly billing statement for verification purposes—an industry practice known as country club billing by the late s however billing statements no longer contained these enclosures but rather a summary statement showing posting date purchase date reference number merchant name and the dollar amount of each purchase at the same time many issuers particularly bank of america were in the process of changing their methods of finance charge calculation initially a previous balance method was used—calculation of finance charge on the unpaid balance shown on the prior months statement later it was decided to use average daily balance which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior months statement several years later new average daily balance—in which transactions from previous and current billing cycles were used in the calculation—was introduced by the early s many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue enhancer ipo and restructuringedit on

lawsuit was filed by the national atm council and independent operators of automated teller machines more specifically it is alleged that mastercards and visas network rules prohibit atm operators from offering lower prices for transactions over pindebit networks that are not affiliated with visa or mastercard the suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using atms limits the revenue that atmoperators earn and violates the sherman acts prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade johnathan rubin an attorney for the plaintiffs said visa and mastercard are the ringleaders organizers and enforcers of a conspiracy among us banks to fix the price of atm access fees in order to keep the competition at bay debit card swipe feesedit visa

into the retail banking sector the report focuses on payment cards and interchange fees upon publishing the report commissioner neelie kroes said the present level of interchange fees in many of the schemes we have examined does not seem justified the report called for further study of the issue on march   the european commission opened an investigation into visas multilateral interchange fees for crossborder transactions within the eea as well as into the honor all cards rule under which merchants are required to accept all valid visabranded cardsneeds update the antitrust authorities of

merchant discount antitrust litigationedit main article payment card interchange fee and merchant discount antitrust litigation on november   a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a classaction lawsuit filed in  by merchants and trade associations against visa mastercard and many credit card issuing banks the suit was filed due to price fixing and other anticompetitive trade practices employed by mastercard and visa a majority of namedclass plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement stephen neuwirth a lawyer representing home depot said “it’s so obvious visa and mastercard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given it’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the home depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal” plaintiffs allege that visa mastercard and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels in their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lowercost cards cash and checks the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a  basispoint reduction  percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months this eightmonth period would probably begin in the middle of  the total value of the settlement will be about  billion according to court filings target walmart home depot neiman marcus saks and  other plaintiffs oppose the settlement a group of large merchants including kroger walgreens and safeway have reached a separate agreement with the defendants over swipe fees the nacs for example harshly criticised the settlement and is urging its members to opt out tom robinson chairman of nacs and president of robinson oil said this proposed settlement allows the card companies to continue to dictate the prices banks charge and the rules that constrain the market including for emerging payment methods particularly mobile payments consumers and merchants ultimately will pay more as a result of this agreement — without any relief in sight josh floum general counsel for visa responded “our belief that the agreement will eventually receive final approval was strengthened today as we have said from the beginning this settlement is a fair and reasonable compromise for all parties” in january  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that any appeals against the settlement that received preliminary approval in november  would not be heard until objections to the settlement are filed and considered by the trial court in september  the practical effect of this ruling was to allow settlement notices to be sent to eligible merchants high swipe fees in polandedit very high interchange fee for visa – from every transactions final price which also includes vat in poland started discussion about legality and need for government regulations of interchange fees to avoid high

what could visa incs new product mean to the payments industry visa has launched a new product designed to make paying for purchases online as easy as swiping a card in the store what will this mean to visa and its rivals matthew frankel tmfmathguy jul   at am visa nysev and its rivals realize that while online shopping can be much more convenient that driving to a store no one has quite figured out a way to make paying by credit card online or in a mobile app as easy as swiping your card at a pointofsale terminal its a pain to have to take your credit card out of your wallet and type in the numbers especially in mobile apps not to mention the feeling of vulnerability that comes with typing your card number expiration date and security code hoping to change that visa has introduced a new product called visa checkout which is intended to be a digital representation of your visa card the idea is that a seamless quick and painless payment experience will make more customers choose to use visabranded cards when shopping how will it compete with a similar product from rival mastercard nysema and will american express nyseaxp come up with something similar and what company has the most to lose here the idea behind visa checkout essentially visas checkout is the most comprehensive way yet for customers to pay with a credit card in one single step source company customers create an account with visa and store the information from their cards as well as shipping information so they literally will have to enter no personal information when shopping then when shopping on a participating merchants website or app with the visa checkout button above all that is needed is a username and password and visa checkout does the rest and security is a big priority for visa when you check out a thumbnail of your own visa card shows up next to the checkout button for authentication visas senior vp of digital solutions sam shrauger said the company will work hard to provide the best security possible to visa checkout users mastercard and amexs efforts visa might be a little late to the party here mastercard recently launched its masterpass product which is now up and running in  countries and provides similar functions as visa checkout in fact masterpass also seems more useful in some ways as it is a full digital wallet while visa checkout is simply a digital representation of your credit card in addition to your credit card and shipping information masterpass also lets you store loyalty and rewards cards and it is worth noting both companies products work with any major credit cards not just their own american express has not come up with its own digital checkout service but is definitely heading in that direction the companys recent partnership with car service uber lets users pay for rides in ubers mobile app with their american express rewards points so it appears that american express is experimenting with oneclick payment solutions but is yet to unveil anything like visa and mastercards products what could it mean to the winners and losers obviously this could mean a lot to visa and mastercard by capturing market share from rival card issuers and other payment processors while both visa checkout and masterpass allow any credit cards to be linked most of the users will likely register visa and mastercard credit cards with their corresponding products one the other hand one company that stands to lose a lot from this is ebays nasdaqebay paypal which until recently was the only widespread way to pay for online purchases by simply entering a username and password in fact i think the biggest impact here will be a significant and gradual loss of fee revenue to paypal as the credit card companies have figured out how to offer a similar way to pay however ebay has managed to stay ahead of the curve so far in the payment processing game so itll be interesting to see how paypal responds to the increased competition in regards to whose product will be more successful its anyones guess at this point however both visa and mastercard will be longterm winners here as more and more consumers adopt their payment solutions
