hioki ft clamp on earth tester features bluetooth wireless technology this product was developed specifically to meet the needs of customers in north america europe and asia where there is high demand for multiple grounding measurements thanks to the small size of the clamp sensor the ft delivers a new level of convenience especially when used in confined locations at the same time we have increased the size of the grip used to open the sensor allowing the new meters to be operated with only half the force required for similar products offered by other companies finally the ft’s incorporation of bluetooth wireless technology allows it to be linked to android handsets for report creation advanced features compact clampon sensor for ultimate convenience in confined locations to date grounding resistance testers from other manufacturers have been characterized by their heavy weight and large jaws which complicate use of the instruments due to the difficulty of attaching them to ground wires responding to resulting demand for more compact sensors hioki engineered a lowprofile sensor just  mm wide for both instruments so that they can be used to measure ground wires that have been installed in cramped spaces the sensor is  percent smaller by volume than sensors on existing competing products larger sensor grip for improved workability hioki has enlarged the clamp sensors grip so that it can be opened with just two fingers enabling it to be operated with only half the force of existing competing products low power consumption for extended use the ft use approximately half the power of competing products maximizing work efficiency because they can be continuously used for longer periods of time bluetooth wireless technology for connectivity with android handsets ft the ft features bluetooth wireless technology allowing users to display data in real time on android handsets and instantaneously create reports in the field including measured values times and dates and position data this technology can be used to email measurement results to an administrator in a remote office in real time onboard storage for  data points the ft can store  data points each including a grounding resistance value and a current value in the field hioki ft datasheet  specifications   fill out the form below for more information about the hioki ft  indicates

hioki ft clamp on earth tester with bluetooth communication   hioki launches clamp on earth tester for multiple grounding use convenient lowprofile sensor is ideal for confined locations ft  ft   hioki ee corporation is pleased to announce the launch of the ft clamp on earth tester for multiple grounding use and the ft featuring bluetooth® wireless technology the two products were developed specifically to meet the needs of customers in north america europe and asia where there is high demand for multiple grounding measurements thanks to the small size of the clamp sensor the ft and ft deliver a new level of convenience especially when used in confined locations at the same time we have increased the size of the grip used to open the sensor allowing the new meters to be operated with only half the force required for similar products offered by other companies finally the ft’s incorporation of bluetooth® wireless technology allows it to be linked to android™ handsets for report creation need for grounding resistance measurement “grounding” generally refers to the act of connecting an electrical device with the ground earth in order to zero out any potential difference electrical equipment must be grounded for safety reasons because ungrounded devices that is devices with a nonzero potential difference may cause electric shock if they malfunction or suffer degraded components utilities and service contractors need to measure grounding resistance in order to verify whether a given device has been reliably grounded while grounding ideally eliminates any potential difference a potential difference does in fact occur between the grounded device and the earth this fact signals the existence of a not negligible level of resistance which is known as grounding resistance it is absolutely critical that we measure grounding resistance in order to ascertain whether it has been minimized to ensure optimal safety easy clamping   open jaws easily with just two
