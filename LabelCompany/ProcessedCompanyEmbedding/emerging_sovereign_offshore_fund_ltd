total number of common shares outstanding the common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the fund at a given time total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the period reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the funds dividend reinvestment plan and sale of all shares at the end of the period sec yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolios underlying asset over the trailing  days relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself the sec day yield  subsidized sub reflects current fee waivers in

holdings are updated  calendar days after monthend the repurchase information only represents shares repurchased as part of a share repurchase program and does not account for any shares repurchased through a tender offer risk considerations there is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks share prices also tend to be volatile and there is significant possibility of loss concentration in a single region may make the portfolio more volatile than one that invests globally fixedincome securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interestrate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk in the current rising interestrate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions longerterm securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes in a declining interestrate environment the portfolio may generate less income investments in securities rated below investment grade commonly known as junk bonds present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higherquality securities investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks the risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk nondiversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers as such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility the jp morgan emerging markets bond index global embi global – tracks total returns for traded external debt instruments in the emerging markets and is an expanded version of the embi as with the embi the embi global includes us dollardenominated brady bonds loans and eurobonds with an outstanding face value of at least  million the indices do not include any expenses fees or sales charges which would have lower performance the indices are unmanaged and should not be considered an investment it is not possible to invest directly in an index closed end funds unlike open end funds are not continuously offered there is a onetime public offering and once issued shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange nav per share is determined by dividing the value of the trusts portfolio securities cash and other assets less all liabilities and preferred shares by the total number of common shares outstanding the common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time morgan stanley investment management msim is the asset management division of morgan stanley     wam is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio the wam calculation utilizes the interestrate reset date rather than a securitys stated final maturity for variable and floating rate securities by looking to a portfolios interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates the wam measure effectively captures a funds exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements   wal is the weighted average life of the portfolio the wal calculation utilizes a securitys stated final maturity date or when relevant the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest such as a put feature accordingly wal reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit widening spreads or tightening liquidity conditions   tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the portfolios blended index added october   as this is a better representation of the portfolios global multiasset strategy the investment team manages the portfolio relative to this blended index   excess return versus custom benchmark is calculated using the portfolios blended index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on october     ntm  next twelve months   ltm  last twelve
