protest b relm wireless corporation december   decision matter of relm wireless corporation file b date december   william l walsh jr esq j scott hommer iii esq peter a riesen esq and keir x bancroft esq venable llp for the protester brian e toland esq department of the army for the agency katherine i riback esq and james a spangenberg esq office of the general counsel gao participated in the preparation of the decision digest protest that agency improperly obtained products outside scope of multipleaward indefinitedeliveryindefinitequantity contracts is denied where the product was reasonably encompassed by the contracts at issue decision relm wireless corporation protests the decision of us army communicationselectronics command cecom to issue a solicitation contemplating the award of a task order under a multipleaward indefinitedeliveryindefinitequantity idiq task order contract to obtain commercial land mobile radio lmr equipment for tactical intrasquad communications relm maintains that this tactical radio is outside the scope of the idiq contracts we deny the protest in  the department of the army issued a solicitation contemplating the award of multiple idiq contracts for base radio systems brs request for proposals rfp no daabrh under the statement of work the solicitation described the scope of the contracts as follows  scope the brs program will offer commercially available radio technology products and services these will allow customers to create a uniquely tailored solution to meet their lmr requirements offerings include categories for lmr systems from full turnkey to customertailored solutions equipment technical support services and system design and analysis rfp attach  statement of work sow at  the solicitation did not include a definition of brs but it did include the following definition of a lmr land mobile radio lmr the collective term for pagers and all fixed mobile and portable nontactical twoway radios used by various base and tenant organizations to control activities on or offbase this term also covers similar assets designated for contingency tactical or war ready material purposes id at  the sow went on to specify that the brs contractors are required to provide commercially available lmr equipment that meets joint tactical radio systems jtrs functional capabilities and association of public safety communications officials apco  guidelines id at  the rfp contemplated that task orders would be competed among the holders of the brs multipleaward task order contracts the solicitations requesting proposals from the brs contractors for a task order are supported by individual customer requirements statements crs which are tailored to the customers specific needs in march  the department of the army was tasked to procure commercial offtheshelf tier  lmrs for tactical operations that were compliant with apco  guidelines and had advanced encryption standard encryption capabilities on july  a letter request for proposals and crs  for radio equipment logistics support and training were issued to brs contractors these tier  lmrs are planned to be used at temporary bases that are set up during tactical operations and are relocated to new positions as the tactical missions evolve to provide intrasquad communications for noncritical command and control administrative and logistics functions and are intended for small unit operations agency report at  relm basically argues that the brs contract is limited to nontactical radios and that the agency is improperly using this contract vehicle to purchase tactical radios in this regard relm cites crs  which states that the tier  lmrs are not intended for use as part of a base radio system for conus or oconus garrison support operations nor as a contingency operation base    land mobile radio system crs  sect  as a general matter our office is statutorily precluded from considering protests challenging the issuance of task or delivery orders under multipleaward contracts see  usc sect cd  specialty marine inc b b june    cpd para  at  there is an exception to this prohibition however where a protester as in this case alleges that a task or delivery order is beyond the scope of the contract originally awarded  usc sect cd specialty marine inc supra when a protester alleges that an order is outside the scope of the contract we analyze the protest in essentially the same manner as those in which the protester argues that a contract modification is outside the scope of the underlying contract the fundamental issue is whether issuance of the task or delivery order in effect circumvents the general statutory requirement under cica that agencies obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures when procuring their requirements specialty marine inc supra see  usc sect aa in determining whether a task or delivery order or modification is outside the scope of the underlying contract and thus falls within cicas competition requirement our office examines whether the order is materially different from the original contract evidence of a material difference is found by reviewing the circumstances attending the original procurement any changes in the type of work performance period and costs between the contract as awarded and the order as issued and whether the original solicitation effectively advised offerors of the potential for the type of orders issued overall the inquiry is whether the order is one which potential offerors would have reasonably anticipated symetrics indus inc b apr    cpd para  at  as noted above the rfps sow included a definition of lmrs that specifically stated that lmrs cover similar assets designated for contingency tactical or war ready material purposes rfp attach  sow at  emphasis added the sow goes on to specify that the brs contractors will offer commercially available lmr equipment that meets joint tactical radio systems jtrs functional capabilities id at  the jtrs is clearly a tactical radio used for tactical purposes agency report at  we agree with the agency that the brs sow requires brs contractors to meet jtrs functional capabilities because the brs contracts include tactical radios we also find the statement in crs  referenced by the protester that the tactical radios to be purchased are not part of a base radio system does not mean that they are outside the scope of the brs contracts as explained by the agency the tier  radios described in crs  are for use at tactical bases whether they are used in a deployed setting or during training exercises as tactical radios operation of the tier  lmrs must be operationally independent of enterprise level or nontactical base radio systems agency report at  according to the agency the necessity for these radios to be able to operate independently from nontactical base radio systems explains why crs  states that the tier  lmrs are not intended for use as part of a base radio system for conus or oconus garrison support operations nor as a contingency operation base    land mobile radio system crs  sect  agency report at  the protester disputes the agencys explanation however it has not shown that the radios being purchased here are outside of the scope of the brs contracts that specifically indicate that they encompass tactical radios to the contrary the record shows that tier  radios are tactical radios that potential offerors reasonably could have anticipated would be covered by the brs contract the protest is denied gary l kepplinger general counsel  in its report the agency defines a brs as a communication system that supports a bases mission agency report at   the agency describes crs  as essentially a combination of a statement of work and objectives    with the technical specifications for the tier  lmr radio agency report at   the protester does not hold a brs contract but is an active supplier of analog tactical and nontactical radios to the army find recent legal decisions  » explore related legal resources  » jul   rcr properties gp we deny the protest b btas inccosts we
