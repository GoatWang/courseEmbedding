experience that counts blue clay’s chief investment officer gary kohler has more than  years of investment experience ranging from managing blue clay’s alternative and long only portfolios to managing family office assets at okabena  company and hedge fund assets at whitebox advisors much of mr kohler’s career has been focused on the smallcap equity markets covering many business cycles   fundamental investors our investment theses are based on longterm business fundamentals and not the quarter through fundamental valuation analysis we discover companies where the markets have mispriced underlying returns on capital cash flows or growth opportunities we apply our fundamental approach to the small and midcap universe where we find greater market inefficiencies and more undiscovered opportunities   focus on capital preservation we seek to generate equity returns while at the same time preserving capital a focus on capital preservation drives portfolio construction and individual position decisions blue clay utilizes a diversified portfolio construction to manage overall direction and net exposures with conservative application of leverage       blue clay

perspective that is desperately needed to the companys board of directors the board we have nominated two highlyqualified director candidates brian a spaly and adam j wright for election to the board at the companys  annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held on may   the annual meeting with a median tenure of  years we believe the current board has grown stale and is failing to act with the urgency and innovative thinking that is required to protect your best interests in this letter we will demonstrate to you the following the stock price underperformance and financial deterioration of the company during the tenure of ceo shelly ibach as well as the companys repeated failures to achieve its stated performance goals that any recent changes you may have noticed from the company can be directly attributed to our presence our strategic plan to enhance longterm shareholder value by aggressively expanding the store base and rightsizing expenses both of which we believe can lead to significant improvements in operating income and margins the poor capital allocation decisions corporate governance practices excessive tenure and interlocks of the current board and its failure to hold management accountable for the companys lackluster performance our highlyqualified nominees are far better equipped than the incumbent nominees to help the board maximize longterm shareholder value select comforts stock has underperformed management has repeatedly failed to meet stated performance goals and financial results have deteriorated since ms ibach became ceo on june   the companys stock price has significantly underperformed not only its mattress industry peers mattress firm holding corp and tempur sealy international inc and its iss peer groups but also the broader market indexes over the same time period total shareholder return june    december   total return mattress firm holding corp  tempur sealy international inc  home furnishing peers  sp  retailing group

hvt kirk lzb ll mfrm pir rh from its ipo on november   and tpx  peer group as defined by iss as of may  we believe the primary reasons for the stocks severe underperformance are the companys repeated failures to meet its stated performance objectives and its declining financial results failures to achieve stated performance goals a review of the companys repeated swings and misses on its performance goals reveals how management and the board have severely damaged their credibility with investors and impaired shareholder value company prediction at its may  investor day ms ibach the companys then chief operating officer and incoming president and ceo stated we are on a path to achieve our goal of more than doubling our  sales and expanding operating margin to more than  by  in my over year retail career i have never been more confident about a strategy as i am about our strategy right now at sleep number the result based on its fiscal  results the company would need to grow its revenues by nearly  and increase operating income by over  to achieve its forecasted results company prediction during ms ibachs first quarterly conference call as ceo on july   the company provided  earnings per share eps guidance for fiscal  of  to  and predicted future earnings growth of at least  per year over the next three years the result the company has fallen short of these goals by  and  in  and  respectively and based on managements own guidance expects to miss its  eps target by a staggering  company prediction ms ibach stated at the companys may  investor day that  of sales increases would flow through to operating income the result the company has generated negative flow through operating income would be  higher today if management achieved its guidance company prediction in  the company stated it would penetrate onethird of the us mattress market covering  key metro areas by  the result the company will only be entering its th market in  given this track record we think shareholders would be hardpressed to believe any rosy predictions of future results that may now be emanating from the companys management deteriorating financial results in addition the company has utterly failed to impose much needed discipline on corporate spending resulting in declining operating income and margins since ltm march  operating expenses have increased  while operating income and margins have decreased  and  respectively since ltm march  the companys total ga expenses and ga expenses per store have increased  and  respectively from march  through fiscal  management and the board have overseen a  million increase in annual advertising expenses and have spent in excess of  million on capital expenditures yet operating income has declined since march  during this period instead of actively pursuing highreturn new stores in new and underpenetrated markets the company has prioritized lowreturn store remodels store relocations and an expensive enterprise resource planning erp operating system the companys erprelated capital expenditures alone total approximately  million between  and  this  million is in addition to the  million asset writeoff the company had to previously expense as a result of a prior failed technology upgrade we are extremely concerned that capital spending on this project is excessive on an absolute basis for a company of this size and even more so when considering that the project was apparently done without a quantified expected return as cfo david callen has stated the primary objectives for the project the reasons for doing it arent so much about the returns on the investment given this mindset it is unsurprising to us that the companys significant increase in expenses has failed to produce positive results for shareholders as return on invested capital per the companys calculation and methodology or roic decreased from  in ltm march  to  in fiscal  excluding the companys significant cash holdings roic declined  from  in ltm march  to  in fiscal  photo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnhinfo recent company changes due to blue clays presence do not go far enough we find it curious how prior to our nomination of our two highlyqualified candidates the companys senior management would not even speak with us yet once we submitted our nominations in december  its shareholder engagement policy appeared to change overnight the company which hasnt held a formal investor day since may  suddenly hosted shareholders and analysts at an industry conference in january  in addition the companys march   letter to shareholders trumpets its alleged proactive shareholder outreach program the timing of which also coincides with our nominations in view of the companys decaying fundamentals we think that any recent uptick in the stock that management may try to use as a diversion is primarily due to the companys aggressive and unprecedented outreach campaign to analysts in response to the nomination of our highlyqualified candidates the company has also sharply reversed course on its message to shareholders culminating with its march   letter that you recently received we believe the following actions were expressly taken as reactionary measures to our nominations before blue clay nominations after blue clay nominations share repurchases objective of its share repurchase program was to maintain common shares outstanding at current levels repurchased targeted amount of shares each quarter regardless of companys share price or valuation changed objective from maintaining share count to being accretive to eps rescinded its quarterly fixed repurchase strategy and added an investment consideration to the repurchase program focus on roic annual cash incentive compensation and longterm equitybased incentive lti compensation performance metrics have focused on absolute growth with no regard for capital deployed or return on that capital to achieve growth targets added roic component to its lti plan in  and specifically discussed roic metric for the first time in its fy  form k and q earnings call march   letter to shareholders is rife with references to roic including how its aggressive growth strategy is carefully calibrated to deliver optimal return on investment and we analyze and prioritize our media spend on a return on investment basis erp system in october  management stated the primary objectives for the erp project the reasons for doing it arent so much about the returns on the investment march   letter states that erp implementation is incorporated in select comforts longrange outlook of … return on invested capital at least in the midteens store target   store target in   and  increased target to  stores in february  march   letter now discloses a fiveyear target of  stores longterm guidance in  management provided year eps guidance which it has not come close to meeting management provided year eps guidance share in   which was reiterated in its march   letter the companys bold  eps pronouncement is especially peculiar given that it has fallen well short of its previous eps estimates this has apparently raised intrigue among other investors as well one research analyst had the following to say on the companys q  earnings call im curious about the timing of your decision to put forth a fiveyear eps kind of plan at a time when you are starting a year where you are about to embark on the erp upgrade… what has changed versus a year ago why give this fiveyear kind of back of the envelope guideline now however these actions merely scratch the surface we seriously question whether without shareholder representation on the board management will be properly incentivized or be held accountable by the current board to continue to act in a manner that is responsive to shareholder concerns we believe that if the mere submission of our nominations can have this type of effect then the actual presence of our shareholder representatives in the boardroom would be a driving force for positive change if past history is any indication of future performance shareholders should have severe doubts about the ability of the company to suddenly achieve its goals under the current board and management blue clay has a plan to enhance longterm value all shareholders should have deep concerns with the companys financial performance the companys recent maneuvers do not nearly go far enough to address the serious issues facing the company in our view the board needs to take immediate substantive action to implement the following growth plan centered around the aggressive expansion of the companys store base we believe these strategic initiatives should enable the company to leverage its overhead infrastructure and existing nationwide advertising program resulting in vastly improved margins eps and roic accelerate new store growth as shareholders we are perplexed by the current boards alarming lack of focus on new store growth based on our analysis of optimal store density we believe the us market has the potential for  total stores yet the company currently operates just  stores and as of february  had plans to open only  net new stores in the next  years although in its march   letter the company suddenly raised its estimate we find it astonishing that the company has fewer stores than it had seven years ago the companys stores are a highreturn investment the company generates fourwall profitability of over  per store and new stores only cost  to open moreover the company has substantial capital available for growth as of the end of fiscal  the companys  million of cash on hand represented sufficient capital to open more than  additional stores as acknowledged by the companys competitors increased store density and proximity are key drivers to accelerating sales within a local market the companys large and rapidlygrowing competitor mattress firm has over  stores up from under  three years ago and sees a need for more than  stores in the us this strategy should come as no surprise to this board and belies any claims management and the board may make about sales cannibalization in early  when five of the existing board members including current nominees stephen l gulis and brenda j lauderback served as directors the company provided guidance to open new stores at a rate of up to  per year from a base of  locations had the company been able to achieve its  growth forecast it would have  stores today double the  stores it currently has and in line with blue clays target of the actual opportunity our plan simply aims to fulfill the promises that the board and management once made to shareholders but have since failed to keep improve margins the companys lack of store growth makes even less sense when viewed in the context of the companys increased spending on national advertising which reaches tens of millions of consumers in larger markets who currently dont have a sleep number store anywhere nearby since ltm march  the companys total advertising expenses have increased  compared to a net sales increase of  advertising expense per store has increased  over this same period faster store development in the companys new and underdeveloped markets along with more efficient spending should enable the company to realize significant operating leverage since ltm march  the company has significantly increased operating expenses while roic has declined blue clays nominees will work to rightsize operating expenses with the goal of increasing roic we note managements repeated statements that  operating margins are attainable although past operating margins have exceeded  fiscal s operating margin fell to  additionally if the company had achieved its flowthrough guidance from its may  investor day operating margins would be  today far more disciplined expense management is required to achieve previous guidance of  operating margins and the  of net sales growth flowthrough to operating income our plan simply aims to fulfill the promises that the board and management once made to shareholders but have since failed to keep do not be deceived by the companys false and misleading claims regarding our plans to cut advertising expenses and eliminate tv advertising our goal is to impose the longterm spending discipline and achieve the economies of scale from revenue growth that management and the board have either been unwilling or unable to do rationalize capital allocation we believe the board needs to make capital allocation decisions based on the expected impact on roic although the company must maintain a reasonable cash balance we believe its stated minimum cash requirement of  million net of customer deposits is overly conservative and unjustified it is evident to us that board members with an owners mentality are vital to the implementation of a more rational capital structure that is needed to unlock shareholder value toward this end we believe excess capital should first be invested in accelerated store growth with remaining excess capital returned to shareholders through sensible share repurchases we believe the current board has failed to act in shareholders best interests and has become stale based on the boards past performance we do not have any confidence in the ability of the board as currently composed to lead the company on this path to longterm value creation with a median tenure of  years we believe the present board has grown stale and is incapable of the type of forwardthinking to execute an ambitious growth initiative for the benefit of all shareholders following are some of the starker examples of this boards poor decisionmaking and corporate governance practices that lead us to this inescapable conclusion failure to hold management accountable rather than have management answer for the companys flaccid stock price and failure to meet performance goals the board has chosen to reward senior executives for subpar results special stock awards – in  despite the fact that the companys stock has lagged major indexes and its peers the board granted special performance awards the  special lti awards to ceo shelly ibach and other company executives the  special lti awards had a grant date price of  and were fully earned at  without any provision for a clawback if the stock price declined providing the executives with an additional  in compensation at that price the grant date and target prices were  and  respectively below the  share price immediately prior to ms ibachs promotion to ceo on june   changing performance metrics – we are also extremely concerned by the boards decision in light of the companys inability to grow its operating margins as forecasted to change the companys  annual cash incentive plan metric from net operating profit nop which it had used since  to ebitda resulting in aggregate cash incentive payments of  to the companys executives as warren buffett said in his  annual letter to shareholders yardsticks seldom are discarded while yielding favorable readings but when results deteriorate most managers favor disposition of the yardstick rather than disposition of the manager we note the companys yardstick change coincides with an implied nop in  of  million a meager  increase from  and even worse  below  which highlights the low returns the company is realizing on its capital expenditures regarding the use of ebitda mr buffett says it best in his  letter to shareholders references to ebitda make us shudder  does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures we believe these actions are strong indicators of a board that is refusing to hold management accountable and we fail to see how these decisions promote longterm shareholder value creation poor capital allocation decisions the current board members have overseen a number of questionable and valuedestructive capital allocation decisions selling low buying high – subsequent to the companys initial public offering at  in  the company has raised approximately  million by issuing  million shares more than doubling its share count at an average price of only  per share  below its ipo price in stark contrast the company has spent nearly  million to repurchase approximately  million shares at an average price of  per share poor share repurchase strategy – only after we nominated our highlyqualified candidates did the board abandon its illconceived strategy of making a fixed amount of share repurchases each quarter regardless of the companys stock price or valuation in order to maintain common shares outstanding at current levels the company has also maintained cash balances well above its stated minimum levels which we believe has caused it to miss favorable opportunities to repurchase shares at attractive prices history of valuedestructive decisions – this boards dubious capital allocation decisions are not a recent phenomenon five of the current board members including mr gulis and ms lauderback were responsible for a series of moves that we believe forced the company into financial distress in  during this time while business fundamentals were rapidly deteriorating the company moved into a new corporate headquarters began a massive erp system upgrade which was subsequently scrapped and levered the balance sheet with bank debt to fund an aggressive repurchase program we believe these decisions directly caused the following chain of events to occur the stock price declined  from its  high of  to  in  the board approved and recommended in may  a highly dilutive equity capital raise at  per share a  discount to the closing market price the day prior to the boards approval interestingly the two independent board members with the largest direct shareholdings at the time voted against this onerous financing and are no longer directors today fortunately shareholders recognized this transaction was not in their best interests and voted the boards poor decision down the board subsequently approved and raised  million at  per share in october  and  million at  per share in december  to remedy bank debt covenants diluting shareholders by  the net closing of  stores from march  through september  and the impairment and abandonment of  million of the erp system investment necessitating significant additional future capital expenditures to reopen stores and install the companys new erp system clearly select comfort shareholders cannot afford to have this history repeat itself no meaningful investment risk at stake we believe the boards troubling failures to act in shareholders best interests are in large part due to the misalignment of interests that exists between the directors and select comforts shareholders collectively the nonexecutive members of the board directly own approximately  of the outstanding stock of the company even when restricted stock awards are included in the calculation in fact according to public filings the members of the board in the aggregate have purchased only  shares in the open market representing a mere  of the outstanding stock of the company but have sold almost double that amount of shares totaling  we believe the boards minimal investment in the shares of select comfort is evidence of their minimal commitment to enhancing and lack of confidence in their ability to create longterm shareholder value insulation of directors through classified board and excessive tenure classified board – select comfort has a classified board which is currently divided into three classes meaning that directors are only subject to reelection by shareholders once every three years we strongly believe that directors should be elected annually in order to ensure director accountability to shareholders in our view the boards current classified structure impedes shareholders ability to regularly and effectively evaluate the performance of their directors and insulates and entrenches the incumbents from the consequences of their questionable decisionmaking excessive tenure – we believe the board has grown stale and is entrenched median tenure is  years two directors have been on the board for more than  years and three other directors have been on the board for at least nine years including mr gulis who has served as a director since  and ms lauderback whose tenure extends back to  tellingly in the companys proxy statement for its  annual meeting its position regarding median board tenure changed from if the median tenure of the board exceeds  years…then one or more directors will either not be renominated or be asked to resign from the board to …then the board may consider alternatives to achieve an appropriate balance of new perspectives and experienced directors on the board over the ensuing years emphasis added we do not believe that the addition of ms ibach and one new independent director to the board since  achieves an appropriate balance and that further change on the board is warranted to ensure new insight and a renewed commitment to enhancing shareholder value we find the following facts about mr gulis and ms lauderback the two incumbents against whom our nominees are running particularly noteworthy stephen l gulis has been on the board for nearly  years since  a retired footwear executive on a board with a total of four current or former footwear executives he previously worked at wolverine world wide inc has purchased only  shares of the companys stock on the open market brenda j lauderback has served as a director for over  years starting in  another former footwear executive whose bio indicates she has been retired since  serves on the board of directors of three other companies including wolverine world wide inc has been a net seller of the companys shares having purchased  shares on the open market and sold a total of  shares including at prices below the market price when she first became a director which we believe reflects a lack of belief in the stock and a lack of alignment with shareholders interestingly one other director david t kollat is also a board member at wolverine world wide inc while another director kathleen l nedorostek works at nine west group ms lauderbacks former employer while these directors all may be technically independent we do not believe this type of cronyism and overlap among board members generates the kind of independent thinking that is necessary to spur positive change for the benefit of all shareholders blue clays nominees have the right blend of experience qualifications and commitment to enhance shareholder value given the boards past track record excessive tenure and misalignment of interests with shareholders we believe the addition of shareholder representatives to the board is crucial to the protection of shareholders best interests blue clays nominees will bring significant and relevant experience and a fresh perspective to the board and will work for the benefit of all the companys shareholders our interests are squarely aligned with yours to capture the opportunities that exist to drive growth at the company and maximize longterm shareholder value our highlyqualified nominees are brian a spaly mr spaly is an experienced ceo with noted public success as the founder and chief executive officer of trunk club inc an innovative apparel retailer recently acquired by nordstrom for  million prior to founding trunk club in

and has also worked at parthenon capital llc a private equity firm mr spaly holds an mba from the stanford graduate school of business mr spalys extensive expertise in retail sales and marketing brandbuilding and customer acquisition will make him a valuable addition to the board in addition we believe mr spalys leadership in the convergence of online and offline retail would greatly enhance

solicitation at select comfort corporation blue clay will continue to monitor progress and hold the board accountable to shareholders may    et from blue clay capital management llc minneapolis may   prnewswire  blue clay capital management llc together with its affiliates and other participants in its solicitation blue clay beneficial owners of  shares of common stock of select comfort corporation nasdaq scss select comfort or the company today issued an open letter to shareholders of select comfort announcing that in recognition of the companys progress in implementing blue clays recommended actions blue clay has determined to withdraw its slate of two director nominees for election to the board of directors of the company at its upcoming  annual meeting  the full text of the letter follows dear fellow select comfort shareholders over five months ago we nominated our two highlyqualified candidates for election to the board of directors the board of select comfort corporation select comfort or the company  in a detailed presentation to management and the board chairman we stated blue clay applauds the companys brand development product innovation and customer experience  however greater focus is needed on increasing store count expanding margins and increasing per share shareholder value  we proposed to work collaboratively with the board and management to enhance per share shareholder value  since that time we are pleased to have seen numerous actions taken by the company in response to our nominations and our carefully researched analysis of the companys financial performance capital allocation decisions and the future opportunities that exist to maximize value for all shareholders new store growth we strongly urged the company to focus on highroic new store growth and significantly increase store openings from its current level of approximately   following our discussions management has increased its goal from  to  stores  we believe that this is a step in the right direction and that store openings will accelerate in previously identified new and underpenetrated markets as the board and management come to realize our recommendation for faster but thoughtfully staged growth is not risky as it has been characterized but rather the highest roic strategy available  as we have highlighted in our analysis for the company and for shareholders the existing national advertising program has fostered a high level of awareness in markets with low store densities  this awareness should ensure new stores are wellreceived and growing revenue in these markets should help to spread the expense of a national advertising program across a greater amount of sales generating a higher return for shareholders capital allocation and focus on roic we advised the board and management to modify and greatly increase the companys share repurchase program prompting the company to change its repurchase objective from maintaining common shares outstanding at current levels to a more sensible approach that repurchases be accretive to earnings  further the company doubled its monthly share repurchase to  million in march  which we support  lastly and most importantly the board and management have now incorporated an roic framework in their share repurchase decisions as well as in performance metrics for the companys executive compensation  we believe roic should drive every spending or investment decision and are hopeful that the board and management will continue to be guided by this fundamental premise since we submitted our nominations on december   as the board and management began implementing our recommended changes and supported the stock with increased share repurchases and investor communication the companys stock price has increased by   as longterm holders we are hopeful the company will continue to make changes that benefit shareholders  specifically we hope that the company will move to  open the four remaining markets previously identified by management to be developed by   close the significant gap to historical margin guidance and  further improve capital allocation by returning more cash to shareholders and reducing annual capital expenditures to focus on new store growth once the erp and store remodel and relocation program are concluded later this year in recognition of the company moving in the overall direction of our recommendations we are withdrawing our slate of two director nominees for election to the board at this years annual shareholders meeting  we remain excited about the opportunity ahead for the company and will continue to encourage the board and management to embrace the strategic initiatives that we have advanced but that have not yet been adopted  we sincerely hope that the board and management will be amenable to considering alternative views expressed by shareholders and continue to foster the direct line of communication with investors that was opened as a result of our nominations  we look forward to working constructively with the board and management to maximize value for all shareholders we want to thank the many shareholders that have expressed their support for our candidates  as we have said many times we are longterm shareholders interested in longterm results and we will continue to press for positive change at select comfort  we expect the board and management to deliver on the promises they have made and as shareholders will continue to hold them accountable for achieving the companys longterm performance objectives about blue clay capital management blue clay capital management is an alternative investment management firm with an experienced team focused on small and
