the filing of the original k   part i   item a   except as otherwise indicated by the context references in this report to we us our our company or the company are to the combined business of china xuefeng environmental engineering inc an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment   risks related to our business our failure to effectively compete in the waste processing market may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and our ability to generate revenue we currently compete primarily on the basis of our ability to secure contracts with waste processing companies and local government entities in the jiangsu province china and surrounding areas for the updating of waste processing equipment  the company is embarking on an area of growth in licensing the use of our licensed patented technology used in these updates and plans to establish our own waste processing centers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such expansion without losses or that our competitors will not develop at a faster rate and offer more favorable arrangements to our current and future customers we expect that we will be required to continue to invest in research and development and building our waste treatment and disposal infrastructure our competitors include both domestic companies and international companies operating in the waste processing industry in china some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition than that of our company at this point as the chinese government continues to support and encourage the development of the environmentally sound waste processing industry more domestic and international competitors may enter the market we believe that the chinese market for our services is subject to intense regional competition with a relatively limited number of large competitors while the company effectively competes in our current focus of updating waste processing equipment for centers in our primary regional market of jiangsu province and surrounding areas our reach outside this primary market and beyond our current focus has yet to be tested and we will necessarily face new competitors in the other geographic markets into which we plan to expand if the chinese government continues to emphasize the spending on environmental protection and continues to allocate funds to our industry the number of our competitors throughout china both domestic and foreign companies will likely increase so we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any new or existing competitors or against any new technologies our competitors may develop or implement  all of these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues profitability and growth prospects   the waste processing industry is highly regulated and our business depends on governmental permits and certifications to operate our business the loss of any of which would have a material adverse impact on our business   only those companies that have been granted operating licenses issued by the prc central and local governments are permitted to engage in the industrial waste treatment and disposal business in china our company is currently fully licensed to carry out our core business of updating and improving waste processing equipment however creation of our own waste processing center in the future will require new licenses for which we will apply the central and local governments of the prc impose strict requirements on companies regarding the technology which must be employed and the qualifications and training of management employees which must be maintained while we possess the necessary permits and certifications to operate our business our regulatory approvals authorizing our operations and activities are subject to periodic review reassessment and renewal by chinese authorities  standards of compliance necessary to pass such reviews change from time to time and differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction leading to a degree of uncertainty if our licenses and permits are revoked substantially modified or not renewed or if additional permits business licenses or approvals that may become necessary in connection with our business are not granted or are delayed we may suffer adverse consequences as a result the termination or suspension of our licenses to operate would have a material adverse impact on our revenue and business    if we fail to introduce new products or services or our existing products and services do not meet the requirements of our customers we may not gain or may lose market share   our continued growth is dependent upon our ability to generate increased revenue from our existing customers obtain new customers and raise capital from outside sources while our current technology is at the forefront of industry developments in order to maintain that advantage we will need to continue to pursue innovative solutions to meet our customers needs we believe that in order to continue to capture additional market share and generate additional revenue we will have to raise more capital to fund the construction and installation of new facilities and to obtain additional equipment to collect process and dispose of industrial waste and recycle waste for our existing and future customers we anticipate that such funding will be provided through a variety of sources including bank loans equity financing and net cash flow generated from operations   in the future we may be unable to obtain the necessary financing for our capital requirements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms which may prevent or delay the planned expansion of our service offerings our failure to provide new products or services may prevent us from retaining customers or gaining new customers which may adversely affect our financial position competitive position growth and profitability our ability to obtain acceptable financing at any time may depend on a number of factors including our financial condition and results of operations the condition of the prc economy the industrial waste treatment industry in the prc and conditions in relevant financial markets in the united states prc and elsewhere in the world   the rapid expansion of our business could strain our resources and adversely affect our ability to effectively control and manage our growth   if our business and markets grow and develop as planned it will be necessary for us to finance and manage expansion in an efficient manner we may face challenges in managing our waste processing equipment updating business over an expanded geographical area as well as managing expanded service offerings including among other things waste processing services and patent licensing such eventualities will increase demands on our existing management workforce and facilities failure to satisfy such increased demands could interrupt or adversely affect our operations and cause administrative inefficiencies   waste processing operations can be hazardous and may subject us to civil liabilities as a result of hazards posed by such operations   waste processing operations are subject to potential hazards incident to the gathering processing and storage of industrial hazardous waste such as explosions product spills leaks emissions and fires these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in the curtailment or suspension of operations at the affected facility consequently we may face civil liabilities in the ordinary course of our business as we update the equipment which performs this process at clients waste processing plants and as we branch into our own waste processing business as the environmental protection industry in china is developing there is no comprehensive insurance available to cover environmental liabilities although we have not faced any civil liabilities in the ordinary course of our waste processing equipment updating operations there is no assurance that we will not face such liabilities in the future if such liabilities occur in the future they may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and business prospects   our success depends on our management team and other key personnel the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results and growth prospects    our success to date has been largely due to the contributions of our current management team especially chairman li yuan the continued success of our business is very much dependent on the experience of the members of our management team and the goodwill that they have developed in the industry to date as a result our continued success is dependent to a large extent on our ability to retain the services of our management team and key personnel the loss of the services of any of our management team or key personnel due to resignation retirement illness or otherwise without suitable replacement or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel would have a material adverse effect on our operations and may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment we do not currently maintain key man insurance covering our key personnel    if we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights we may be exposed to intellectual property infringement and the value of our intellectual property rights could diminish   if we need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights such actions may be costly and may divert management attention as well as expend other resources which could otherwise have been devoted to our business an adverse determination in any such litigation could impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition historically implementation of prc intellectual propertyrelated laws has been lacking primarily because of ambiguities in the prc laws and difficulties in enforcement accordingly intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in china may not be as effective as in the united states or other countries which increases the risk that we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property given the relative unpredictability of chinas legal system and potential difficulties enforcing a court judgment in china there is no guarantee that we would be able to halt any unauthorized use of our intellectual property through litigation which may cause us to lose our competitive advantage and adversely affect our business and profitability   we may face claims for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights    we may face claims from third parties with respect to the infringement of any intellectual property rights owned by such third parties there is no assurance that third parties will not assert claims to our processes technologies and systems in such an event we may need to acquire licenses to or to contest the validity of issued or pending patents or claims of third parties there can be no assurance that any license acquired under such patents would be made available to us on acceptable terms if at all or that we would prevail in any such contest in addition we would incur substantial costs and spend substantial amounts of time in defending ourselves in or contesting suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another partys patent rights as such our operations and business may be adversely affected by such civil actions we rely on trade secrets technology and knowhow there can be no assurance that other parties may not obtain knowledge of our trade secrets and processes technology and systems should these events occur our business would be affected and our profitability affected   a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our improvement and upgrading business  as our improvement and upgrading business has become dependent on only a limited few customers such dependency may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition   our improvement and upgrading business greatly relies on our ability to maintain and continue to develop our customer base our improvement and upgrading business generated revenue from four customers for the fiscal year ended may   should any of our current customers cease to require the use of our service and if we are unable to grow our customer base on a timely basis our operations revenue and profitability could be materially and adversely affected bot buildoperatetransfer projects that we may be awarded could be adversely affected by cost overruns project delays andor incorrect estimation of project costs   the company is establishing its own waste processing centers as an extension of its current business  however any future bot projects we may be awarded will require us to incur high upfront expenditures  therefore it is important that we manage such projects efficiently in terms of time procurement of materials and allocation of resources if our initial cost estimates are incorrect or delays occur in a project resulting in cost overruns the profitability of that project could be adversely affected cost overruns due to additional rectification work and delays in completion of projects or delivery of waste to our new processing centers would adversely affect our profitability we may also face potential liability from legal suits brought against us by our government customers for causing loss due to any delay in completing a project in addition we may also face potential liability from legal suits brought against us by our customers who have suffered loss due to such mismanagement or mistakes this would also adversely affect our profitability and financial position  substantially all of our business operations are concentrated in jiangsu and surrounding areas and expose us to regional economic or market declines   substantially all of our revenues are generated from jiangsu china our current customer base is comprised of companies located in jiangsu and surrounding areas as a result any adverse economic developments in jiangsu could affect regional waste generation rates and demand for waste processing services which we plan to provide in the future or waste processing equipment upgrades which we currently provide to waste processing centers in jiangsu in addition adverse market developments caused by increased waste disposal capacity from our competitors in this region could adversely affect waste disposal pricing while one of our main growth strategies is to expand into other geographic markets in china the occurrence of any adverse economic developments in jiangsu and surrounding areas could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and growth prospects through agreements with a group of shareholders our president and ceo has control over majority interest of the company in april  our president and ceo mr li yuan entered into written authorization agreements with  shareholders of the company which gave him investing and dispositive power of the shares held by these individuals and control of  of the total voting ownership in january  mr yuan entered into similar agreements with  additional shareholders that provided mr yuan with control to a total voting ownership of  as of august    mr yuan is able to exercise control over all matters requiring shareholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions he also has significant control over our management and policies and will be able to significantly influence decisions affecting our capital structure this control may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in companys best interest   we are subject to risks relating to expanding into other geographic markets in china outside of our principal market of jiangsu   to take advantage of industrialization outside of jiangsu and to expand our service offerings to other geographic markets we plan to establish centers for waste processing both within jiangsu and expanding into other areas of the country we intend to build and operate waste treatment facilities gradually   expansion into new geographic markets will require us to comply with rules and regulations of the applicable local government and to address certain business issues particular to each market depending on the development and demand of customers within that market as a result there may be a significant period of time before any facility that we construct develops a consistent revenue stream accordingly any delays or interruptions in implementing our expansion strategy or our business operations outside of jiangsu may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects profitability and financial condition   relaxed enforcement of prc environmental laws and governmental approvals and noncompliance by new and existing customers could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and growth prospects   companies operating in the waste treatment and disposal industry are subject to chinas national environmental protection law as well as a number of other national and local laws and regulations governing air water noise pollution and establishing pollutant discharge standards in addition such companies are subject to stringent licensing and certification requirements imposed by the prc ministry of environmental protection and the provincial environmental bureaus which has created high barriers to entry for potential market participants  however the urbanization and industrialization from chinas rapid economic growth has created an increased need for waste treatment services from solid waste disposal to sewage and sludge treatment in order to help meet the demand for such services the central government may not strictly enforce the compliance with environmental laws and relax certain conditions to gaining governmental licensing and approvals  if such an event were to occur there would be more competitors to our business operations and customers may turn to less expensive competitors for their waste disposal needs which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and grow prospects    fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities   the value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and the rmb and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated appreciation or depreciation in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar would affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into us dollars as well as earnings from and the value of any us dollardenominated investments we make in the future   since july  the rmb is no longer pegged to the us dollar although the peoples bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant shortterm fluctuations in the exchange rate the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term moreover it is possible that in the future prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the rmb exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market in august  the prc government devalued its currency by approximately    very limited hedging transactions are available in china to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations to date we have not entered into any hedging transactions while we may enter into hedging transactions in the future the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all in addition our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into foreign currencies   under the new income tax law enterprises established outside the prc whose de facto management bodies are located in the prc are considered resident enterprises and their global income will generally be subject to the uniform  enterprise income tax rate on december   the prc state council promulgated the implementation regulations on the new income tax law the implementation regulations which define de facto management bodies as bodies that have material and overall management control over the business personnel accounts and properties of an enterprise in addition a recent circular issued by the state administration of taxation on april   provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a prc company or a prc company group will be classified as a resident enterprise with its de facto management bodies located within the prc if the following requirements are satisfied   i     the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function mainly in the prc     ii      its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the prc     iii       its major assets accounting books company seals and minutes and files of its board and shareholders meetings are located or kept in the prc and     iv        more than half of the enterprises directors or senior management with voting rights reside in the prc    because the eit law its implementing rules and the recent circular are relatively new no official interpretation or application of this new resident enterprise classification is available therefore it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case   if the prc tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes a number of unfavorable prc tax consequences could follow first we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of  on our worldwide taxable income as well as prc enterprise income tax reporting obligations in our case this would mean that nonchina source income would be subject to prc enterprise income tax at a rate of  second although under the eit law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our prc subsidiary would qualify as taxexempt income we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a  withholding tax as the prc foreign exchange control authorities which enforce the withholding tax have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for prc enterprise income tax purposes finally it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new resident enterprise classification could result in a situation in which a  withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our nonprc stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our nonprc stockholders from transferring our shares   we do not carry business interruption insurance so we could incur unrecoverable losses if our business is interrupted   we are subject to risk inherent to our business including equipment failure theft natural disasters industrial accidents labor disturbances business interruptions property damage product liability personal injury and death we do not carry any business interruption insurance or thirdparty liability insurance or other insurance to cover risks associated with our business as a result if we suffer losses damages or liabilities including those caused by natural disasters or other events beyond our control and we are unable to make a claim against a third party we will be required to bear all such losses from our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives   as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we will be subject to the reporting and other requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of  or the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and protection act these rules and regulations will require among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives   we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act of    we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act and for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period    in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an emerging growth company we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reports are not as transparent as other companies in our industry if we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected     risks related to doing business in the prc   we face the risk that changes in the policies of the prc government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the prc and the profitability of such business   the prcs economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market oriented economy subject to fiveyear and annual plans adopted by the central government that set national economic development goals policies of the prc government can have significant effects on the economic conditions of the prc the prc government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy under this direction we believe that the prc will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the prc will follow market forces while we believe that this trend will continue we cannot assure you that this will be the case a change in policies by the prc government could adversely affect our interests by among other factors changes in laws regulations or the interpretation thereof confiscatory taxation restrictions on currency conversion imports or sources of supplies or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises although the prc government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades we cannot assure you that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered especially in the event of a change in leadership social or political disruption or other circumstances affecting the prcs political economic and social environment   introduction of new laws or changes to existing laws by the prc government may adversely affect our business    the prc legal system is a codified legal system made up of written laws regulations circulars administrative directives and internal guidelines unlike common law jurisdictions like the us decided cases which may be taken as reference do not form part of the legal structure of the prc and thus have no binding effect on subsequent cases with similar issues and fact patterns furthermore in line with its transformation from a centrallyplanned economy to a more free marketoriented economy the prc government is still in the process of developing a comprehensive set of laws and regulations as the legal system in the prc is still evolving laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same may be subject to further changes for example the prc government may impose restrictions on the amount of service fees that may be payable by municipal governments to wastewater and sludge treatment service providers also the prc central and municipal governments may impose more stringent environmental regulations which would affect our ability to comply with or our costs to comply with such regulations such changes if implemented may adversely affect our business operations and may reduce our profitability    the prc laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain any changes in such prc laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business   there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of prc laws and regulations including but not limited to the laws and regulations governing our business or the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens death bankruptcy and criminal proceedings we are required to comply with prc laws and regulations these laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty the effectiveness of newly enacted laws regulations or amendments may be delayed resulting in detrimental reliance by foreign investors new laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively we cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new prc laws or regulations may have on our operations financial condition and business prospects  a slowdown or other adverse developments in the prc economy or other major economies all over the world may have a material adverse effect on our customers demand for our services and our business a slowdown in the economic growth in the prc has recently occurred   all of our revenues are currently generated in the prc where all of our business operations are conducted because there are signs that the growth of prc economy has slowed down over the last few years we cannot assure you that such growth will continue moreover china enjoys an exportoriented economy and it relies on external demand the industrial waste treatment industry in the prc is relatively new and growing but we do not know how sensitive we are to a slowdown in economic growth or other adverse changes in the prc economy which may affect demand for our products and services a slowdown in overall economic growth an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in the prc or other major economies all over the world may materially reduce the demand for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business    inflation in the prc could negatively affect our profitability and growth   while the prc economy has experienced rapid growth such growth has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation in order to control inflation in the past the prc government has imposed controls on bank credits limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending such an austere policy can lead to a slowing of economic growth which may have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition   governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment   the prc government imposes controls on the convertibility of renminbi or rmb into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of currency out of the prc we receive all of our revenues in rmb which is currently not a freely convertible currency shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay expenses and dividends or otherwise satisfy foreign currency dominated obligations under existing prc foreign exchange regulations payments of current account items including profit distributions interest payments and expenditures from the transaction can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the prc state administration of foreign exchange or safe by complying with certain procedural requirements however approval from appropriate governmental authorities is required where rmb is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the prc to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies   the prc government also may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions if the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due    the fluctuation of rmb may materially and adversely affect your investment   the value of the rmb against the us dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by among other things changes in the prcs political and economic conditions as we rely entirely on revenues earned in the prc any significant revaluation of rmb may materially and adversely affect our cash flows revenues and financial condition for example to the extent that we need to convert us dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into rmb for our operations appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar could cause the rmb equivalent of us dollars to be reduced and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations conversely if we decide to convert our rmb into us dollars for the purpose of making dividend payments on our common stock or for other business purposes and the us dollar appreciates against the rmb the us dollar equivalent of the rmb we convert would be reduced in addition the depreciation of significant us dollar denominated assets could result in a change to our operations and a reduction in the value of these assets in august  the prc government devalued the currency by approximately  the impact of this devaluation is not currently determinable   because our principal assets are located outside of the united states and all of our directors and all our officers reside outside of the united states it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights based on us federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors or to enforce a judgment of a united states court against us or our officers and directors in the prc   all of our directors and officers reside outside of the united states in addition substantially all of our assets are located outside of the united states it may therefore be difficult for investors in the united states to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws against us in the courts of either the us or the prc and even if civil judgments are obtained in us courts to enforce such judgments in prc courts further it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the united states and the prc would permit effective enforcement against us or our officers and directors of criminal penalties under the us federal securities laws or otherwise   adverse changes in economic and political policies of the prc government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china which could adversely affect our business   substantially all of our business operations are conducted in china accordingly our results of operations financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic political and legal developments in china chinas economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects including with respect to the amount of government involvement level of development growth rate and control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources   since the adoption of the open door policy in  and the socialist market economy in  the prc government has been reforming and is expected to continue to reform its economic and political systems any changes in the political or economic policy of the prc government may lead to changes in the laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same as well as changes in the foreign exchange regulations taxation and import and export restrictions which may in turn adversely affect our financial performance while the current policy of the prc government seems to be one of imposing economic reform policies to encourage foreign investments and greater economic decentralization there is no assurance that such a policy will continue to prevail in the future   while the prc economy has experienced significant growth in the past  years growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of china the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources some of these measures benefit the overall prc economy but may also have a negative effect on us for example our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us since early  the prc government has implemented certain measures to control the pace of economic growth such measures may cause a decrease in the level of economic activity in china including the manufacturing output of our customers which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and business prospects the growth rate of the prc economy has recently beguns to slowdown    failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and chinese anticorruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences   we are required to comply with chinas anticorruption laws and the united states foreign corrupt practices act which generally prohibits us companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business in addition we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls foreign companies including some of our competitors are not subject to these prohibitions corruption extortion bribery payoffs theft and other fraudulent practices occur from timetotime in mainland china if our competitors engage in these practices they may receive preferential treatment from some companies giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses which would put us at a disadvantage although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible if our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition our brand and reputation our sales activities or the price of our ordinary shares could be adversely affected if we become the target of any negative publicity as a result of actions taken by our employees or other agents we do not have liability business interruption litigation or natural disaster insurance   the insurance industry in china is still at an early stage of development in particular prc insurance companies offer limited business products as a result we do not have any business liability disruption insurance or any other forms of insurance coverage for our operations in china any potential liability business interruption litigation or natural disaster may result in our business incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources   restrictions under prc law on our prc subsidiarys ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow make investments or complete acquisitions that could benefit our business pay dividends to you and otherwise fund and conduct our businesses   substantially all of our revenues are earned by our prc subsidiary however prc regulations restrict the ability of our prc subsidiary to make dividend and other payments to its offshore parent company prc legal restrictions permit payments of dividend by our prc subsidiary only out of its accumulated aftertax profits if any determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations our prc subsidiary is also required under prc laws and regulations to allocate at least  of our annual aftertax profits determined in accordance with prc gaap to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches  of our registered capital allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans advances or cash dividends any limitations on the ability of our prc subsidiary to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business     failure to comply with prc regulations relating to the foreign exchange registration for oversea investment and return investment by prc resident   in october  safe issued the notice on relevant issues in the foreign exchange control over financing and return investment through special purpose companies by residents inside china generally referred to as circular  which required prc residents to register with the local safe branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company or spv for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of china on the strength of domestic prc assets originally held by those residents internal implementing guidelines issued by safe which became public in june  known as notice  expanded the reach of circular  by  purporting to cover the establishment or acquisition of control by prc residents of offshore entities which merely acquire control over domestic companies or assets even in the absence of legal ownership  adding requirements relating to the source of the prc residents funds used to establish or acquire the offshore entity covering the use of existing offshore entities for offshore financings  purporting to cover situations in which an offshore spv establishes a new subsidiary in china or acquires an unrelated company or unrelated assets in china and  making the domestic affiliate of the spv responsible for the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in connection with any such registration notably the business plan which describes the overseas financing and the use of proceeds  amendments to registrations made under circular  are required in connection with any increase or decrease of capital transfer of shares mergers and acquisitions equity investment or creation of any security interest in any assets located in china to guarantee offshore obligations and notice  makes the offshore spv jointly responsible for these filings in the case of an spv which was established and which acquired a related domestic company or assets before the implementation date of circular  a retroactive safe registration was required to have been completed before march   this date was subsequently extended indefinitely by notice  which also required that the registrant establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the spv and its affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  failure to comply with the requirements of circular  as applied by safe in accordance with notice  may result in fines and other penalties under prc laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions any such failure could also result in the spvs affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital share transfer or liquidation to the spv or from engaging in other transfers of funds into or out of china we have advised our shareholders who are prc residents as defined in circular  to register with the relevant branch of safe as currently required in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our prc subsidiary and affiliate however we cannot provide any assurances that their existing registrations have fully complied with and they have made all necessary amendments to their registration to fully comply with all applicable registrations or approvals required by circular  moreover because of uncertainty over how circular  will be interpreted and implemented and how or whether safe will apply it to us we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies for example our present and prospective prc subsidiarys and affiliates ability to conduct foreign exchange activities such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currencydenominated borrowings may be subject to compliance with circular  by our prc resident beneficial holders in addition such prc residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by circular  we also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect shareholders or the outcome of such registration procedures a failure by our prc resident beneficial holders or future prc resident shareholders to comply with circular  if safe requires it could subject these prc resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions restrict our overseas or crossborder investment activities limit our subsidiarys and affiliates ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure which could adversely affect our business and prospects   risks related to our vie agreements   the prc government may determine that the vie agreements are not in compliance with applicable prc laws rules and regulations   baichuang consulting provides support and consulting services to jiangsu xuefeng pursuant to the vie contractual agreements  almost all economic benefits and risks arising from jiangsu xuefengs operations are transferred to baichuang consulting under these agreements  details of the vie agreements are set out in description of business – contractual arrangements with our controlled affiliate and its shareholders above   there are risks involved with the operation of our business in reliance on the vie agreements including the risk that the vie agreements may be determined by prc regulators or courts to be unenforceable  our prc counsel has provided a legal opinion that the vie agreements are binding and enforceable under prc law but has further advised that if the vie agreements were for any reason determined to be in breach of any existing or future prc laws or regulations the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such breach including          ● imposing economic penalties         ● discontinuing or restricting the operations of baichuang consulting or jiangsu xuefeng         ● imposing conditions or requirements in respect of the vie agreements with which baichuang consulting or jiangsu xuefeng may not be able to comply         ● requiring our company to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations         ● taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could adversely affect our companys business and         ● revoking the business licenses andor the licenses or certificates of jiangsu xuefeng andor voiding the vie agreements   any of these actions could adversely affect our ability to manage operate and gain the financial benefits of jiangsu xuefeng which would have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations   our ability to control jiangsu xuefeng under the vie agreements may not be as effective as direct ownership   we conduct our business in the prc and currently generate virtually all of our revenues through the vie agreements our plans for future growth are based substantially on growing the operations of jiangsu xuefeng  however the vie agreements may not be as effective in providing us with control over jiangsu xuefeng as direct ownership  the vie agreements do not provide us with daytoday control over the operations of jiangsu xuefeng  under the current vie arrangements as a legal matter if jiangsu xuefeng fails to perform its obligations under these contractual arrangements we may have to i incur substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements and ii rely on legal remedies under prc law which we cannot be sure would be effective therefore if we are unable to effectively control jiangsu xuefeng it may have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives and grow our revenues as the vie agreements are governed by prc law we would be required to rely on prc law to enforce our rights and remedies under them prc law may not provide us with the same rights and remedies as are available in contractual disputes governed by the laws of other jurisdictions   the vie agreements are governed by prc law and provide for the resolution of disputes through the jurisdiction of the courts in the prc  if jiangsu xuefeng or its shareholders fail to perform the obligations under the vie agreements we would be required to resort to legal remedies available under prc law including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief or claiming damages we cannot be sure that such remedies would provide us with effective means of causing jiangsu xuefeng or its shareholders to meet their obligations or recovering any losses or damages as a result of nonperformance further the legal environment in china is not as developed as in other jurisdictions uncertainties in the application of various laws rules regulations or policies in prc legal system could limit our liability to enforce the vie agreements and protect our interests   the payment arrangement under the vie agreements may be challenged by the prc tax authorities   we generate our revenues through the payments we receive pursuant to the vie agreements currently all of our operations reside in the vie which is required to pay our wholly owned subsidiary baichuang consulting  of their earnings as defined plus a monthly consulting fee of rmb approximately us  we could face adverse tax consequences if the prc tax authorities determine that the vie agreements were not entered into based on arms length negotiations for example prc tax authorities may adjust our income and expenses for prc tax purposes which could result in our being subject to higher taxes or cause other adverse financial consequences  item a control and procedures a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule ab under the
