different a clearing firm will look depending on which brokerdealer–ria they are accessed through for our part we have chosen not to delegate key functions like transfer of assets and cashiering to nfs and we’ve chosen to pay for upgraded optional services eg expanded tax reporting on behalf of our advisors perhaps of paramount importance we’ve invested considerable time and money internally

to perform an indepth customized analysis we would be delighted to do this for you please also note you pay your brokerdealer–ria for services too many advisors don’t realize that most brokerdealer–rias do not offer similar services these incremental differences have a significant impact on an advisor’s bottom line while it is important to understand your payout it may be even more
