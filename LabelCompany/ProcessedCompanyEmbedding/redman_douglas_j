royal swedish academy of sciences  abstract urbanization is a global multidimensional process paired with increasing uncertainty due to climate change migration of people and changes in the capacity to sustain ecosystem services this article lays a foundation for discussing transitions in urban governance which enable cities to navigate change build capacity to withstand shocks and use experimentation and innovation in face of uncertainty using the three concrete case cities— new orleans cape town and phoenix—the article analyzes thresholds and crossscale interactions and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of “system of cities” ie they cannot be seen as single entities based on this the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems the article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing humandominated ecosystems practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented

his article andersson   in discussing cape town with its previous institutionalized apartheid system we recognize that racial categories are social constructs that serve certain interests of domination however through practices of domination racial categories nonetheless become real as they constrain or facilitate individuals access to societys resources  it needs to be acknowledged that average per capita numbers conceals high inequities for instance people classified during apartheid as whites consumed more water than the majority eg through being owners of wineries and being better connected to water infrastructure  arbesman et al  mention two other possible explanations to urban innovation that cities simply have more highly educated people and more transient people that bring new ideas however the social networks of cities—especially the great number of longdistance weak ties—constitute a fundamental difference between urban and nonurban systems  we note how this also partly resonates with ideas from the early s as articulated by for instance the american intellectual and regional planning theorist luis mumford – luccarelli  article views » abstract  references
