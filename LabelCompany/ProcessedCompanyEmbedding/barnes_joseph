everything you have with a guy named bernie madoff steady returns dude a nobrainerthe tyranny of small decisions someone once called it the gate of history turns on small hingesdanny goodman’s nightmare began with a quick handshake and a friendly smilewhenever he drove up to his daughter’s private school the lyman academy danny couldn’t help thinking of stately wayne manor the baronial mansion outside gotham city where batman lives as bruce wayne if only he were driving the batmobile instead of a  honda accordlyman was the most exclusive private girls’ school in boston and most of the other cars in the pickup line were gleaming luxury suvs range rovers or mercedesbenzes or land cruisers today though abby would be spared the public humiliation of an accord sighting because her father had arrived twenty minutes early for the afternoon pickup he had an appointment with the head of the upper school tinsley thornton whom everybody called lallylally no wonder the place made danny uncomfortablehe parked in the side lot where the teachers parked and where his  dented old honda didn’t look quite so out of placethe office of the head of the upper school was at the end of a long corridor next to the headmaster’s office and admissions which might as well have been labeled rejections you either had to know someone—several someones—to get into lyman or be able to write a check sizable enough to build a new library danny had been fortunate the foundation his late wife sarah had worked for was endowed by a guy who also happened to be chairman of lyman’s board of trusteeslally thornton welcomed him to her large oakpaneled office with a concerned look clutching his hand in two of hers her steelgray hair was held back with a black velvet headband she wore a black turtleneck a double strand of pearls and perfume with the strong floral smell of urinal cake her air of lethal graciousness always reminded danny of that socialite girls’school headmistress who shot the diet doctor years ago“is everything all right with abby at home” she asked with hushed concern settling into a low brocade chair while danny sat on the couch at a right angle to her“oh yeah she’s—doing well” he swallowed hard “it must be so difficult for her”he nodded “but you know abby’s a strong kid” “losing a mother at her age what a terrible thing”danny nodded she must have just reviewed the file “i had a quick question about the italy trip” he saidshe lit up “it is such a profound experience” she said “you’ll see it changes them they come back different people—more aware of the world more appreciative of different cultures and well it seems to just dissolve all those cliques all those silly tensions between the girls i’d even call it transformative abby—oh she’s going isn’t she”“well see that’s the question”“she must she absolutely must it’s the trip of a lifetime”he blotted his damp palms on the knees of his suit pants “right i know i’ve heard    but abby—well you know how idealistic these girls can be at that age she’s sort of concerned that some of her classmates might find it difficult to go”“difficult”“the five thousand dollars i mean not everyone can afford it and you know that bothers her” danny tried to sound casual as if he were a hedge fund tycoon with a social conscience instead of a writer whose advance on his latest book had run out months agowhat lally apparently didn’t know was that he was more than a month late with this semester’s tuition he had no idea how he could possibly come up with it—let alone five thousand bucks for a trip to italy on top of that lyman had the biggest endowment of any private school in the united states he was fairly certain they’d squeak by a bit longer without his lousy sixteen thousand dollarshe imagined her reply why that fivethousanddollar fee that’s merely a suggestion a recommendation of course it’s waived if it’s a hardship for any familyhe felt a single fat bead of sweat trickle down behind his left ear then down the side of his neck and under his shirt collar“isn’t that thoughtful of her well you tell abby that if any of her friends aren’t going to italy because of the money their parents should say something to leah winokur right away we have scholarships for deserving minorities”“of course” he’d come here to try and finagle something that might enable abby to go to italy a price break maybe a loan something a scholarship for minorities didn’t exactly help the only minority that abby goodman blondhaired and blueeyed belonged to at this school was girls whose parents didn’t have a summer house “you know i do wonder whether it might be difficult for other parents too—not minorities but not you know the very wealthy to pay that kind of money on top of everything else”“i doubt most lyman parents would consider that a hardship after all no one has to go to italy”with a smile as cold as a pawnbroker’s she said “was there anything else”the halls were crowded with teenage girls it rang with squeals and shouts and laughter some of them walked arm in arm or hugged one another danny often marveled at how affectionate girls that age were and couldn’t help contrasting them with teenage boys who smelled like old gym socks and zit cream and expressed affection by punching one another  on the shoulderhe waited for abby with a deep sense of dreadnot going on the italy trip she’d said would be social death she’d be a pariah he’d told her he’d think about it he’d see what he could domeeting with lally thornton had been a desperation move a hail mary pass that didn’t complete no need to let abby in on just how bad things were how they were basically living on fumes he wanted her life to be as normal as possible given the circumstancesshe was doing better than a lot of girls her age would have done she was strong but her mother’s death had hit her hard for months her de fault expression had been a darth vader mask of anger who could blame herhe didn’t look forward to giving her the bad news about the one thing she was looking forward tofrom behind him came a rumbling basso profundo “oh danny boy the pipes the pipes” sang a school security guard leon chisholm he was a black man of about sixty with closecropped white hair and a wide open face he wore wirerimmed glasses and had a gap between his front teeth the vibe was part professor part prizefighter he’d spent twenty years with the boston police department so he was probably able to handle a few mean girls in lululemon yoga pants“officer” danny said with a grin and clapped him companionably on the shoulder when leon’s oldest daughter rebecca had graduated from bunker hill community college—the first in the family to go to college— danny had helped her get a job with a publisher in boston leon liked danny one of the few lyman dads who said hi and actually chitchatted with him to most other lyman parents leon was invisiblethen danny caught a glimpse of abby near the front lobby—her silvery metallic fringed scarf then her face smiling which surprised him he couldn’t remember when he’d last seen her smile she was walking arm in arm with her new bff jenna galvinjenna galvin seemed to be abby’s polar opposite she was small and darkhaired and chubby where abby was slender and graceful and blond jenna seemed sour aloof even arrogant whereas abby was sweetnatured and sociable or had been anyway until six months ago jenna had just transferred to lyman as a junior which was unusually late to start a new school and had apparently been an outcast there abby empathic as ever and maybe also a bit rebellious had felt bad for the new girl and befriended her now they were inseparableabby’s face lit up when she saw her father which was disorienting— was she smiling at someone else she maneuvered nimbly through the teeming horde of girls and threw her arms around himfirst uncoerced hug in eleven months danny thought but who’s counting“oh my god daddy thank you”for what he wanted to sayshe hugged him even harder he still hadn’t gotten used to how tall she’d grown “thank you thank you thank you i just saw my name on the italy trip list i knew you’d let me go you are so awesome”“abby honey—”jenna touched her arm “my dad’s here come on” a sleek silverhaired man in an expensivelooking camelcolored suit entered the lobby and gave jenna a kiss“abby wait—what are you talking about” danny saidbut abby didn’t hear him she’d turned around and was talking tojenna abby said “i know right” before turning back to her father “daddy is it okay if i go home with jenna”he felt a flash of irritation she never seemed to want to spend time at home but he said only “well i don’t know i’d rather not have to drive out to weston to pick you up”“esteban will take her home” jenna saidesteban was the galvins’ driver jenna’s father was some kind of investor and had a lot of money even by lyman standards“abby” danny said but then someone tapped him on the shoulder he turnedthe silverhaired man thomas galvinhe appeared to be in his late forties his bluegray eyes were like steel against his deep tan his suit was exquisitely cut his pale blue shirt perfectly pressed his tie neatly knotted everything in place danny’s crappy sport coat which he’d bought off the discount rack at the men’s wearhouse black friday sale felt itchy“just wanted to introduce myself” the man said offering his hand “tom galvin”“dan goodman”abby was already out the front door with jenna “nice to meet abby’s dad she’s terrific”“most of the time” danny said with a grin “jenna couldn’t ask for a better friend” “well it’s great to meet you too”“listen thanks for letting me kick in on that italy thing” he had the accent of a kid out of southie“kick in”“abby has been a lifesaver for our jenna you have no idea” “hold on a second you paid for abby’s trip to italy”“for totally selfish reasons trust me” he lowered his voice to a confidential mutter “this is jenna’s fourth school in three years she was already begging to leave until she started hanging out with abby and she sure as hell doesn’t want to go with the class to italy if abby’s not going” danny’s cheeks grew hot he was astonished and embarrassed and angry though he rarely let anyone see his angerhow much had abby told her friend she couldn’t possibly know how bad their financial situation was but she must have said something this was beyond embarrassing it was demeaning this rich guy was treating them like a charity case“that’s extremely generous of you” he said “but i can’t accept it” “please it’s for my daughter”“i’m sorry i’ll call the bursar and set them straight but i really do appreciate the thought” he smiled then turned and pushed through the front doorsthe sun dazzled his eyes a gleaming black maybach limousine was parked at the curb it had to belong to galvin a man in a uniform of black suit white shirt and black tie approached abby and jenna with a cardboard starbucks takeout tray and handed them each a cup galvin’s chauffeur must have gone on a starbucks run“thanks esteban” abby said she turned as danny emerged beaming excitedly her eyes shining “everything okay daddy”he beckoned her over “boogie” he began quietly using the pet name he never used around anyone else“oh god i’m so so so excited” she interrupted then followed a tor rent of words—pasta and gelato and shopping—that danny couldn’t quite follow she grabbed both of his elbows “i’m going to italy” she almost sanghe hadn’t seen her this happy in years dimples had appeared on her cheeks her smile so wide it looked like her face might crack in twonow what tell her there’d been a mixupdanny had once made the mistake of opening a link a friend had sent him it was something called a crush video it showed a woman stepping on a tiny kitten with her stiletto heels it was one of the sickest most disturbing things he’d ever seen and he wished he could unsee ittelling abby the italy trip wasn’t going to happen would feel a bit like that“dan” galvin said by way of greeting as he came out the front door lowering his blackberrydanny approached and said in a low voice “i can only accept this if you’ll let me pay you back”galvin’s eyebrows shot up he nodded solemnly “if you don’t i’ll send my goons after you” he gave danny a wry smile“i mean no offense but it’s a little awkward we don’t even know each other”“which is crazy right given how close abby and jenna are listen come over for dinner tomorrow night wouldja the boys are home from college and they love abby and celina is making her famous arroz con pollo”what could he say the guy was shelling out for his daughter’s trip to italy dinner with his family was the least he could domuch later he’d replay that moment over and over again in his head he thrust out his hand and smiled “sounds great” he said “thanks a lot”when danny opened the door of the twobedroom on marlborough street he was greeted by the loud thumping of a dog’s tail against the floor rex their arthritic chocolate lab struggled to get up from his bed near the kitchen“that’s okay buddy no need to get up for my sake” he said coaxing rex back down onto the plaid dog bed stroking his graying coat massaging his haunches rex was thirteen years old which was old for the breed his muzzle had gone silver his amber eyes clouded with an opaque cataract haze he’d belonged to sarah went with her after the divorce and then had moved in with abby the old boy profligate with affection had heroically gotten abby through her mother’s deaththe red message light on danny’s phone was blinkingeight voice mails seven from one particularly odious and persistent collections agent named tony santangelo of asset recovery solutions who seemed to have trained at the bada bing school of debt collection his “solution” was to “garnish” danny’s wagesgarnish such a benignsounding word like parsley sprigs and radish rosesand what wageshe’d replayed over and over that odd exchange with tom galvin thanks for letting me kick in on that italy thing who was the guy really in the age of the internet the information had to be out there and danny if nothing else was an ace researchersitting at his desk in the small alcove off the living room that was now his “study”—his office had become abby’s bedroom—danny opened a browser on his old macbook pro linkedin had a long list of thomas galvins halfway down that roster was a thomas x galvin who’d graduated from boston college worked for putnam investments and was the founder chief executive chief investment officer and managing director of galvin advisers on saint james avenue in bostonbingorex who was now curled atop danny’s shoes heaved a long soulful sigh and nuzzled even closergalvin advisers of boston mass the website was nothing more than a secure portal a page showing an overhead view of boston’s financial district and a login box that asked for user name and password above it the words “this website is intended solely for the employees and investors of galvin advisers”danny’s girlfriend lucy lindstrom arrived with dinner in a white plastic bag takeout from a place on newbury street a salad for her and linguine with shrimp scampi for him he could smell the garlic the warm olive oil oregano a vinegary biteshe leaned over to stroke rex’s face causing him to close his eyes in bliss then she gave danny a squeeze and a kiss her hair gave off a faint whiff of cigarette which told danny she’d spent the day doing outreach she was a psychiatrist for the boston health care for the homeless program and she spent two days a week on the streets of boston trying to bribe and wheedle homeless people to come in and get treatedshe wore a pale gray turtleneck under a blue vneck sweater with black jeans and a great old pair of black leather boots that danny loved seeing her in she was wearing her chunky black glasses which danny was convinced she used to make herself plainer and thus less vulnerable at work it gave her a sort of winsomely studious lookthey’d been going out for three years but they’d known each other since freshman year at columbia back then before life had kicked them both around lucy lindstrom seemed unattainable to danny she was the it girl of his college class she had blond hair that came down in unruly ripples to her shoulders a sharp nose and chin bluegray eyes a dazzling smile an endearing overbiteback then she’d been way out of his league frankly she still wasthe two decades since college had etched faint lines around her mouth and vertical worry lines between her pale eyebrows it wasn’t just the years she’d also survived an unhappy first marriagedanny knew she was overly sensitive about the signs of aging indoctrinated like most women by fashion magazinesdanny couldn’t care less he thought lucy was more beautiful now than when she was a freshmanshe set the round foil takeout pans on the dining table and eased off their cardboard lids“hard day”“mostly a lot of walking around i need a shower” lucy never complained about her work he admired that “glass of wine first”“sure why not”he pulled the cork out of a chilled bottle of sancerre and poured them each a glass they clinked the wine was crisp citrus and chalky“street outreach”she nodded “there was this guy at south station today sleeping on a bench he looks like he’s seventy but he could be ten years younger—you know how the street ages them well the police tried to take him to one of our day shelters but he refused to go really fought with them so i tried”she looked pained as if reliving the moment and at the same time tender transported she felt a deep connection with the homeless guys as far as danny was concerned they were vagrants and bums but they were lucy’s children her wards not her patients“i told him it’s getting to be really cold at night and he should sleep at the night center not out on the street but he said people were tampering with his food and they’ll get to him if he goes to sleep he started babbling—all kinds of nonsense word salad”he nodded “paranoid schizophrenic” he found her work fascinating but also fundamentally baffling how could she bear taking care of people who didn’t want her help“probably we need to get him on risperdal but first i need to get him to talk so i asked if i could sit with him and he said no i said i just wanted to help he said ‘what the hell can you do for me’ so i said ‘well i have cigarettes’ and he said ‘oh okay’” she took a sip of winedanny laughed “suddenly you couldn’t shut him up”“i gave him a fivedollar gift certificate for mcdonald’s a cigarette and a pair of white tube socks”“so he’s coming in to see you”she shook her head “later maybe first i have to get him to trust me but you know there’s something really    moving about this guy”“how so”“there’s an intelligence in there a really great interesting mind locked away deep inside it’s sort of heartbreaking”the phone rangno he thought don’t let it be tony santangelo from asset recovery solutions again he was about to let it go to voice mail when he checked the caller id  area code and the name of his literary agency levitan freed associateshis agent mindy levitan rarely called except when she was in the middle of negotiating a deal for himit couldn’t be good news“how’s life in the salt mines” mindy said she had a raspy voice from years of smoking which she’d only recently been able to quit with the help of a russian hypnotist“excellent” he lied “deep into it” for several years now he’d been working on a biography of a nineteenthcentury robber baron named jay gould“good good that’s what i like to hear” she said it without enthusiasm “so listen danny sorry to call you at suppertime but i just got into my country house and checked my messages and i got a call from louisa” louisa penniman was danny’s editor she was a legendary editor of “serious” nonfiction she’d made her bones on “inside the beltway” books about politics and a couple of presidential memoirs she was widely feared and even more widely disliked“you’re breaking up” danny said “i’m losing you”“nice try we’re both on landlines listen this is serious danny she wants to cancel the bookdanny felt his mouth go dry “she wants to cancel because i’m a few months late” “first kiddo it’s not ‘a few’ months it’s fifteen months—” “okay but—”“you know how bad things are in the industry publishers are all freaking out about ebooks they’re looking for any excuse to cancel contracts these days”“was there ever a time when things weren’t bad in publishing” mindy gave a quick rueful laugh more a bark “louisa penniman doesn’t screw around”“this isn’t just a threat i mean you think—she’s actually serious” “as cancer” mandy said then quickly she added “sorry bad choice of words”mindy levitan had gotten him a bigger advance for his biography of jay gould than he’d ever expected it helped that his first book the kennedys of boston had been a finalist for the pulitzer prize even though it didn’t sell particularly well or actually win the pulitzer for that matteralso he had to admit that his proposal had been damned good even better was mindy’s pitch to publishers no one knows who jay gould is anymore she’d written in her cover email yet no one had heard of some olympic track star shot down in world war ii but unbroken was a massive bestseller nor had anyone heard of a serial killer who menaced chicago during the world’s fair which didn’t stop readers from buying the devil in the white city it’s all in how the story is toldand danny knew how to tell the story jay gould was a railroad speculator and a strikebreaker and one of the richest men in america an inside trader and a virtuoso at bribery a scammer and a liar who actually bragged about being “the most hated man in america”random house harpercollins and simon  schuster had all bid but louisa at triangle had topped them all the money sounded good at first—until you subtracted mindy’s fifteen percent and spread the payments out over the three years at least it would take him to write the book plus a big chunk of the money wouldn’t come in until the trade paperback was published at least a year after the hardcover not that he was complaining he got to do what he loved and if he lived frugally and didn’t go on any trips to the caribbean he could have made itbut then came the call from sarahhis exwife had just gotten the results of a biopsy there’d been no lump nothing on a mammogram just a little warmth and redness in one breast she noticed one day the skin felt different hard and taut like an orange her lymph nodes were enlarged her doctor had told her it was probably an insect bite and he’d prescribed antibioticsher doctor was wrongthe survival rates for inflammatory breast cancer weren’t great she was a single mom and she was frightenedone minute danny was researching the great southwest railroad strike of  and the next he was googling estrogen receptors sarah’s second husband had taken a job at a firm in manhattan and their eventual breakup had been acrimonious and the guy was a jerk as sarah had finally come to realize she needed danny’s helphe began eating a lot of cafeteria meals at the danafarber cancer centerfor the first time in years his daughter actually seemed to need him around too she needed a steadying presence she also needed someone to drive her to dance practice and play rehearsals and sleepovers while he waited in the cramped back room of the dance studio he researched chemotherapy and radiation and hyperthermia and raw apricot seeds and vitamin band jay gould moved to the back burnerbecause mr gould as fascinating as he was wasn’t as important as danny’s daughter or his exwife whom he’d never stopped loving even when she stopped loving him“danny” “what”“i said we need to figure out what’s next how soon can you get me a hundred hundred fifty pages to see if we can keep them on the reservation keep her from canceling”“you think that’ll do it”“might who knows it’s the only card i have to play so you’ll do it” danny wasn’t even close to having a decent hundredplus pages and he wouldn’t be for at least a month but if the book was canceled there went his entire income streamdanny swallowed hard “no problem” he saidlucy looked at him arched her brows and smiled sadly “how bad” “very” he told her what mindy had to say and about his meeting with the head of schooland then about the surprise loan from thomas galvin“oh” she said “that’s generous” she didn’t sound enthusiastic “lucy”she avoided his eyes “let’s hear it” he said“well are you sure that’s really a good idea” “why not”“i just think it’s weird for this guy who doesn’t even know you to pay for your daughter to go on a trip”“it’s unusual i’ll give you that though he invited us over for dinner tomorrow night”“i work tomorrow night i mean if i was even invited does abby know about this”“i don’t think so”“never underestimate teenage girls they notice everything and they can be manipulative believe me i used to be one”“maybe”“i just think it’s not a good idea to borrow money from this guy you barely know it just—well it sends up a red flag”“you know what’s not a good idea charging five thousand bucks for a friggin’ school trip to italy the way this school just takes for granted that parents can shell out that kind of money”“you’re just figuring this out”“no but it still annoys me what it’s doing to abby” “so we’re really talking about abby’s new friend”“abby gets driven home from the galvins by a hispanic servant wearing a chauffeur’s uniform okay there’s something wrong with that” “i wouldn’t mind it”“she’s a kid and it’s not her life it’s someone else’s”“exactly that’s not her life and she knows it that kind of thing isn’t going to turn her head”“how could it not it’s like when someone says to you ‘doesn’t that tag inside the neck of your tshirt bother you doesn’t it itch’ and all of a sudden what do you know—it does itch that tag starts driving you crazy”“the itch being—what living with a father who adores her but doesn’t happen to be a zillionaire”they heard the squeak of the frontdoor hinges the thud of abby putting down her backpack the thumpthumpthump of rex’s tail against the floor abby was talking to the dog as if he were either a young child or a moron “how was your day rex have you been a good boy oh why is your collar still on” the dog’s prong collar jingled “let’s ask daddy if he remembered to take you out for a walk”when she walked to the kitchen she looked more like a woman less like a girl in the couple of months since she’d become best friends with jenna she’d started dressing differently instead of her everyday uniform of light blue juicy sweatpants and a plaid fleecelined flannel shirt untucked she’d wear preppylooking twin sets and leggings she’d started using makeup he wanted to tell her to stop slow down you have your whole life to be a grownup you only get to be a girl for a few years“for you” she pulled an envelope from the pile and dropped it on the table he recognized the creamcolored paper stock of a lyman academy envelope “looks like another bill” she said “are we behind on the tuition again”“we’re fine” he said “nothing to worry about you have dinner yet i’ve got some shrimp and linguine left if you want it or i could make i don’t know macaroni and cheese”“no thanks” she said her tone softening a bit “i ate at the galvins’” “great” he said trying to sound upbeat lately she’d been having dinner most nights with jenna and her family who could blame her dinner with just the two of them was often strained punctuated by long silences but still   “i guess i get to meet them tomorrow night” she nodded “i know you’ll like them a lot”“hey abby” said lucy coming up from behind and giving abby a quick peck on the cheek “i love those flats tory burch”abby looked uncomfortable but at the same time pleased “i guess” danny used to worry about how his daughter would get along with his girlfriend but she and lucy seemed to be friends maybe it was because lucy never tried to take sarah’s place maybe it was because abby wanted another mother figure in her life maybe it was because sarah had married a man abby didn’t like“they’re so cute” lucy said “are they new” danny askedabby’s face reddened she looked around theatrically and said “what is this like the style network um can i go do my homework now please”“in a moment” danny said “we’re talking”abby folded her arms and compressed her lips making it clear how much talking she planned to do“i asked are those shoes new”abby looked at him steadily for a long moment as if deciding how to reply finally she said “they’re a gift from the galvins okay”“that’s so nice” lucy said trying to calm the waters she busied herself at the dining table which was piled with books and papers and junk mail she was smart enough not to get involved any further“a gift for what occasion”“occasion” abby’s eyes widened “i mean for standing there like a dork watching jenna buy stuff when we were at the natick mall this afternoon because i don’t have a credit card and i don’t have any money and she probably just felt sorry for me”“she felt sorry for you”“she has her own platinum american express card and i don’t even have like a debit card”“that’s terrible how can a girl show her face if she doesn’t have a platinum amex card” abby smoldered silently“if you wanted to buy something you could have called me you know that”“and you would have said no”“maybe yes maybe no but at least you should have asked”“oh yeah sure i could see that like ‘hi dad i just saw the cutest pair of tory burch flats and jenna just bought a pair and can i have two hundred dollars to buy them too’ like you would have said yes at least why don’t you be honest with yourself”“two hundred dollars” danny said “you’re damned right i would have said no” “see”obviously his daughter didn’t mind receiving charity from the galvins “you girls spent the afternoon at a shopping mall what about your homework”“i didn’t have my laptop with me” “why not”“you’re talking about that macbook that weighs like a thousand pounds i don’t think so”“you carried it around all last year and didn’t mind”“and the year before and the year before and the year before it’s a dinosaur it should like be on antiques roadshow or whatever”he tried not to laugh “if you need a new laptop we can talk about it” he said “until then why don’t you invite jenna over here sometime maybe you two can actually get some homework done”abby stared with incredulity “are you serious”“if you’re concerned about privacy i can go out and work somewhere while you girls are here find a starbucks whatever”“you don’t get it do you” “what am i not getting”“you think i want her to see this    this veal cage we live in” danny couldn’t help bursting out laughing“it’s not funny” she protested“of course it’s not sweetie” danny said when her mother was well before her second marriage broke up abby had lived in a rambling old sixbedroom victorian in chestnut hill that belonged to her stepfather a partner in a big boston law firm now she had no stepfather—not that she minded that—and no rambling house and no motherhe came closer tried to put his arms around her but she bucked away “i just want to make sure you give yourself enough time to do your homework this is a really important year you know that this fall you’ll be applying to colleges and—”“seriously” she said stiffening “seriously” then yelling “i don’t believe this”she spun around and ran into her bedroom and slammed the door lucy glanced up from the dining table gave a sad smile she didn’t need to say anything she felt bad for both father and daughter she understood the complexity her marriage to an architect had broken up though amicably her son kyle was a sophomore at bowdoin she’d been through all thisshe ran her fingers through danny’s hair “no one ever said teenagers were easy” she murmuredlucy woke early and made coffee for the two of them before leaving for work danny managed to get in a solid hour of writing before he  heard the music coming from abby’s roomthumping floorvibrating bass some kind of hiphop it wasn’t so long ago that abby awoke to some sweet twangy ballad by taylor swift or one of her many clones now everything she listened to sounded the same autotuned vocal tricks and rants about being “on the floor” in “the club” twenty minutes later he was sitting at the dining table reading the boston globe and sipping coffee from an oversize white mug that said i ♥ my daddy in the spindly printing of a fiveyearold the y looked like poseidon’s trident abby had made it at a friend’s birthday party at a clay workshop in brookline where kids decorated readymade pieces of ceramic pottery over a decade ago and he remembered it as if it were a few monthsabby emerged from the bathroom in a steam cloud wearing a bathrobe hair wet from the shower she came over to the small kitchen without acknowledging his presence and poured herself a bowl of cinnamon roll frosted miniwheats doused it with lactaid milk and brought it over to the dining table“any left for me” she asked as she sat down “any what”“that” she pointed at his coffee mughe grinned “you’re too young to get hooked on caffeine”she slid the pile of mail in front of her and began flipping idly through the envelopes “i mean it’s so not a big deal when i sleep over at the galvins’ celina always makes café con leche for jenna and me”“celina is their housekeeper or their cook”“keep up dad she’s jenna’s mom” she picked up the creamstock envelope from lyman and slid a finger under the flap he didn’t want her looking at the reminder note—no need for her to worry—but he also didn’t want to make too big a deal of it so he said nothing“well you’re not at the galvins’ are you” he said and he couldn’t hide his smilehe’d solemnly sworn when sarah and he first saw that whooshing heartbeat on the fetal monitor never to say all those trite predictable things that all parents seem to say like as long as you live under my roof you’ ll live by my rules and because i said so and i don’t care what the other kids do and don’t make me stop this carhe put the milk away in the refrigerator and then he heard a highpitched sound a stifled cry and he whirled aroundabby was holding the lyman letter in a trembling hand the paper rattled her face had gone pale“hey don’t worry about it” he said “the check’s a little late i have to move some money around”she was crying with an abandon that danny had seen her do only once before in the hospital room right after sarah had died there was barely any sound like she was gasping for breath or hiccupping her eyes were wide her mouth open and downturned she looked almost in shock tears streamed down her cheeksdanny felt his insides clutch she was overreacting but he couldn’t stand seeing her in pain “boogie” he said softly coming over to her and circling his arms around her shoulders from behind “abby baby what’s wrong” he glanced at the letter and felt his stomach drop even though he glimpsed only fragments of sentences it was enough to understand   regret to inform    leave us no choice    immediate payment is received    abigail’s school records    assist in the transfer to another school   unless lyman academy received sixteen thousand dollars by twelve pm on friday—three days from then—abby would have to leave the schoolhe squeezed her tight her tears scalding his forearm her chest heaving “listen” he said softly yet firmly “that’s not going to happen okay” then came a rush of words in one terrible anguished sob most of which he couldn’t make out just the words “all my friends” and “daddy”the shape of her mouth when she’d let out a cry was precisely the same as it had been seconds after she’d been born when the nurse had taken her all of six pounds from the obstetrician’s gloved hands swaddling her ex pertly in a blanket and put her down on the warming table then this tiny infant had curled her tiny hands into fists and let out a great big gusty cry the first of her life announcing hey i’m hereand he knew he’d always do everything in his power to protect this little creature“sweetie” he said “listen to me don’t even think about it that is not going to happen you have my word”but he knew his assurances were hollow his promises empty and he wondered whether she knew it toodanny had been late with the tuition once before last semester in fact but the bursar’s office had let him slide for a few weeks they must have gotten marching orders from the administration to be compassionate since abby’s mother had died over the summerbut lyman’s compassion apparently had its limitshe had no pull at the school the guy whose foundation sarah had worked for who’d been chairman of the lyman board had died of a stroke a couple of years agoso he decided to go straight to the top“i’m having sort of a silly little problem i thought you might be able to help me with” he told lally thornton when he finally got her on the phone “seems i’m a bit late with this semester’s tuition—it’s mostly a matter of liquidity moving money around and such but i should have it cleared up in a week or so”he paused waited for her to say something reassuring but there was only silence then she said “and”finally he went on “i thought you might be able to reassure the bursar’s office for me”“i’m sorry i don’t follow”“you know we got a form letter about abby having to leave lyman if the bursar doesn’t receive a check by friday or whatever they’re being pretty hardline about it”“well i’m not sure i understand why you called me mr goodman this is a matter for the bursar’s office not for the head of the upper school”“i’ve already spoken with them—”“so i understand” her tone had become downright icy “you’re not asking that an exception be made for you i trust”“not an exception per se but—well a little leeway is all a little compassion really”“i’m sorry mr goodman i wish i could help please ask abby to send me a note once she’s settled at her new school tell me how she’s doing i really am so fond of her”even if he could bring himself to ask lucy to lend him money he knew she didn’t have it to lend she was barely getting by herself so that was outhis parents helen and bud lived modestly and always had in the same small house in a development in wellfleet massachusetts on cape cod where danny had grown up his dad was a contractor and a finish carpenter and a decent man but he was irascible he was a man who didn’t take guff he was always pissing people off at the same time he was a good person he always paid his construction crew better than anyone else whenever any of them ran into trouble he’d bail them out lend them money and not keep track of what he was owedwhen he retired he had hardly any savings he and danny’s mother lived off social securitydanny had no one to borrow the money from at least no family or friends he tried to remember why he was so uncomfortable about accepting a loan from thomas galvin for the italy trip pride that didn’t seem like such a compelling reason anymore he imagined a balance scale with his pride on one side—looking like some raw shapeless pulsing purplish internal organ—and abby’s happiness on the other he imagined abby as a chubby laughing baby wearing only a diaper the chubby baby easily outweighed the pulsing blob what had he been thinking if he had jewelry to pawn or anything of value to sell he’d do it in a split second if he knew a vinny icepick he’d borrow sixteen largehe had to find some money somewhere somehow    and soon show more what people are saying about this from the publisher “a novel that is as timely and cognizant of contemporary society as it is a startling seat of the pants

clandestine situations and corrupt politics into a gripping story with plenty of twists scenes play out with a hip rollicking energy that propels the plot along with breakneck speed though deceptively simple this suspense tale works on several levels with the crime element often taking a backseat to more personal matters moral dilemmas and questions of professional ethics are subjects not often explored in runofthemill thrillers but finders shrewd understanding of conflicted human nature helps elevate paranoia above most books in the genre tom piccirilli publishers weekly is it too early to declare finders fifth novel after high crimes the most entertaining thriller of  probably but it will be a surprise if another suspenser proves as much sheer fun as finders robust tale of corporate

chapter until the whole thing happened i never believed the old line about how you should be careful what you wish for because you might get iti believe it nowi believe in all those cautionary proverbs now i believe that pride goeth before a fall i believe the apple doesnt fall far from the tree that misfortune seldom comes alone that all that glitters isnt gold that lies walk on short legs man you name it i believe iti could try to tell you that what started it all was an act of generosity but that wouldnt be quite accurate it was more like an act of stupidity call it a cry for help maybe more like a raised middle finger whatever it was my bad i half thought id get away with it half expected to be fired ive got to say when i look back on how it all began i marvel at what an arrogant prick i was im not going to deny that i got what i deserved it just wasnt what i expected — but whod ever expect something like thisall i did was make a couple of phone calls impersonated the vp for corporate events and called the fancy outside caterer that did all of wyatt telecoms parties i told them to just make it exactly like the bash theyd done the week before for the top salesman of the year award of course i had no idea how lavish that was i gave them all the right disbursement numbers authorized the transfer of funds in advance the whole thing was surprisingly easythe owner of meals of splendor told me hed never done a function on a company loading dock that it presented décor challenges but i knew he wasnt going to turn away a big check from wyatt telecomsomehow i doubt meals of splendor had ever done a retirement party for an assistant foreman eitheri think thats what really pissed wyatt off paying for jonesies retirement party — a loading dock guy for christs sake— was a violation of the natural order if instead id used the money as a down payment on a ferrari  modena convertible nicholas wyatt might have almost understood he would have recognized my greed as evidence of our shared humanity like a weakness for booze or broads as he called womenif id known how it would all end up would i have done it all over again hell nostill i have to say it was pretty cool i was into the fact that jonesies party was being paid for out of a fund earmarked for among other things an offsite for the ceo and his senior vice presidents at the guanahani resort on the island of st barthélemyi also loved seeing the loading dock guys finally getting a taste of how the execs lived most of the guys and their wives whose idea of a splurge was the shrimp feast at the red lobster or ribs on the barbie at outback steakhouse didnt know what to make of some of the weird food the osetra caviar and saddle of veal provençal but they devoured the filet of beef en croûte the rack of lamb the roasted lobster with ravioli the ice sculptures were a big hit the dom perignon flowed though not as fast as the budweiser this i called right since i used to hang out on the loading dock on friday afternoons smoking when someone usually jonesie or jimmy connolly the foreman brought in an igloo of cold ones to celebrate the end of another weekjonesie an old guy with one of those weathered hangdog faces that make people like him instantly was lit the whole night his wife of fortytwo years esther at first seemed standoffish but she turned out to be an amazing dancer id hired an excellent jamaican reggae group and everyone got into it even the guys youd never expect to dancethis was after the big tech meltdown of course and companies everywhere were laying people off and instituting frugality policies meaning you had to pay for the lousy coffee and no more free cokes in the break room and like that jonesie was slated to just stop work one friday spend a few hours at hr signing forms and go home for the rest of his life no party no nothing meanwhile the wyatt telecom estaff was planning to head down to st barts in their learjets boink their wives or girlfriends in their private villas slather coconut oil on their love handles and discuss companywide frugality policies over obscene buffet breakfasts of papayas and hummingbird tongues jonesie and his friends didnt really question too closely who was paying for it all but it did give me some kind of twisted secret pleasureuntil around onethirty in the morning when the sound of electric guitars and the screams of a couple of the younger guys blotto out of their minds must have attracted the curiosity of a security guard a fairly new hire the pays lousy turnover is unbelievable who didnt know any of us and wasnt inclined to cut anyone any slackhe was a pudgy guy with a flushed sort of porky pig face barely thirty he just gripped his walkietalkie as if it were a glock and said what the helland my life as i knew it was overchapter the voice mail was waiting for me when i got in to work late as usualeven later than usual actually i felt queasy and my head thudded and my heart was going too fast from the giant cup of cheap coffee id gulped down on the subway a wave of acid splashed over my stomach id considered calling in sick but that little voice of sanity in my head told me that after the events of last night the wiser thing to do was to show up at work and face the musicthing is i fully expected to get fired — almost looked forward to it the way you might both dread and look forward to having an aching tooth drilled when i came out of the elevator and walked the halfmile through the lower forty of the cubicle farm to my workstation i could see heads popping up prairiedog style to catch a glimpse of me i was a celebrity the word was out email was no doubt flyingmy eyes were bloodshot my hair was a mess i looked like a walking just say no public service spotthe little lcd screen display on my ip phone said you have eleven voice mails i put it on speaker and zipped through them just listening to the messages frantic and sincere and wheedling increased the pressure behind my eyeballs i got out the advil bottle from the bottom desk drawer and dry swallowed two that made six advils already this morning which exceeded the recommended maximum so what could happen to me die from an ibuprofen overdose just moments before being firedi was a junior product line manager for routers in our enterprise division you dont want the english translation its too mindnumbingly boring i spent my days hearing phrases like dynamic bandwidth circuit emulation service and integrated access device and atm backbones and ip security tunneling protocol and i swear i didnt know what half the shit meanta message from a guy in sales named griffin calling me big guy boasting of how hed just sold a couple dozen of the routers i was managing by assuring the customer that theyd have a particular feature — extra multicast protocols for live video streaming — that he knew damned well it didnt have but it sure would be nice if the feature was added to the product like maybe in the next two weeks before the product was supposed to ship yeah dream ona followup call five minutes later from griffins manager just checking on the progress of the multicast protocol work we heard youre doing as if i actually did the technical work myselfand the clipped important voice of a man named arnold meacham who identified himself as director of corporate security and asked me to please come by his office the moment i got ini had no idea who arnold meacham was beyond his title id never heard his name before i didnt even know where corporate security was locatedits funny when i heard the message my heart didnt start racing like you might expect it actually slowed as if my body knew the gig was up there was actually something zen going on the inner serenity of realizing theres nothing you can do anyway i almost luxuriated in the momentfor a few minutes i stared at my cubicle walls the nubby charcoal avora fabric that looked like the walltowall in my dads apartment i kept the panel walls free of any evidence of human habitation — no photos of the wife and kids easy since i didnt have any no dilbert cartoons nothing clever or ironic that said i was here under protest because i was way beyond that i had one bookshelf holding a routing protocol reference guide and four thick black binders containing the feature library for the mgk router i would not miss this cubiclebesides it wasnt like i was about to get shot id already been shot i figured now it was just a matter of disposing of the body and swabbing up the blood i remember once in college reading about the guillotine in french history and how one executioner a medical doctor tried this gruesome experiment you get your kicks wherever you can i guess a few seconds after the head was lopped off he watched the eyes and lips twitch and spasm until the eyelids closed and everything stopped then he called out the dead mans name and the eyes on the decapitated head popped open and stared right at the executioner a few seconds more and the eyes closed then the doctor called the mans name again and the eyes came open again staring cute so thirty seconds after being separated from the body the heads still reacting this was how i felt the blade had already dropped and theyre calling my namei picked up the phone and called arnold meachams office told his assistant that i was on my way and asked how to get theremy throat was dry so i stopped at the break room to get one of the formerlyfreebutnowfiftycent sodas the break room was all the way back in the middle of the floor near the bank of elevators and as i walked in a weird sort of fugue state a couple more colleagues caught sight of me and turned away quickly embarrassedi surveyed the sweaty glass case of sodas decided against my usual diet pepsi — i really didnt need more caffeine right now — and pulled out a sprite just to be a rebel i didnt leave any money in the jar whoa thatll show them i popped it open and headed for the elevatori hated my job truly despised it so the thought of losing it wasnt exactly bumming me out on the other hand it wasnt as if i had a trust fund and i sure did need the money that was the whole point wasnt it i had moved back here essentially to help with my dads medical care — my dad who considered me a fuckup in manhattan bartending i made half the money but lived better were talking manhattan here i was living in a ratty streetlevel studio apartment on pearl street that reeked of traffic exhaust and whose windows rattled when the trucks rumbled by at five in the morning granted i was able to go out a couple of nights a week with friends but i usually ended up dipping into my checking accounts credit line a week or so before my paycheck magically appeared on the fifteenth of the monthnot that i was exactly busting my ass either i coasted i put in the minimum required hours got in late and left early but i got my work done my performance review numbers werent so good — i was a core contributor a two band just one step up from lowest contributor when you should start packing your stuffi got into the elevator looked down at what i was wearing — black jeans and a gray polo shirt sneakers — and wished id put on a tiechapter when you work at a big corporation you never know what to believe theres always a lot of tough scary macho talk theyre always telling you about killing the competition putting a stake in their heart they tell you to kill or be killed eat or be eaten to eat their lunch and eat your own dog food and eat your youngyoure a software engineer or a product manager or a sales associate but after a while you start to think that somehow you got mixed up with one of those aboriginal tribes in papua new guinea that wear boars tusks through their noses and gourds on their dicks when the reality is that if you email an offcolor politically incorrect joke to your buddy in it who then ccs it to a guy a few cubicles over you can end up locked in a sweaty hr conference room for a grueling week of diversity training filch paper clips and you get slapped with the splintered ruler of lifething is of course id done something a little more serious than raiding the officesupply cabinetthey kept me waiting in an outer office for half an hour fortyfive minutes but it seemed longer there was nothing to read — just security management stuff like that the receptionist wore her ashblond hair in a helmet yellow smokers circles under her eyes she answered the phone tapped away at a keyboard glanced over at me furtively from time to time the way you might try to catch a glimpse of a grisly car accident while youre trying to keep your eyes on the roadi sat there so long my confidence began to waver that might have been the point the monthly paycheck thing was beginning to look like a good idea maybe defiance wasnt the best approach maybe i should eat shit maybe it was way past thatarnold meacham didnt get up when the receptionist brought me in he sat behind a giant black desk that looked like polished granite he was around forty thin and broad a gumby build with a long square head long thin nose no lips graying brown hair that was receding he wore a doublebreasted blue blazer and a blue striped tie like the president of a yacht club he glared at me through oversized steel aviator glasses you could tell he was totally humorless in a chair to the right of his desk sat a woman a few years older than me who seemed to be taking notes his office was big and spare lots of framed diplomas on the wall at one end a halfopened door let onto a darkened conference roomso youre adam cassidy he said he had a prissy precise way of speaking party down dude he pressed his lips into a smirkoh god this was not going to go well what can i do for you i said i tried to look perplexed concernedwhat can you do for me how about start with telling the truth thats what you can do for me he had the slightest trace of a southern accentgenerally people like me im pretty good at winning them over — the pissedoff math teacher the enterprise customer whose order is six weeks overdue you name it but i could see at once this wasnt a dale carnegie moment the odds of salvaging my odious job were dwindling by the secondsure i said the truth about whathe snorted with amusement how about last nights catered eventi paused considered youre talking about the little retirement party i said i didnt know how much they knew since id been pretty careful about the money trail i had to watch what i said the woman with the notebook a slight woman with frizzy red hair and big green eyes was probably there as a witness it was a muchneeded morale boost i added believe me sir itll do wonders for departmental productivityhis lipless mouth curled morale boost your fingerprints are all over the funding for that morale boostfundingoh cut the crap cassidyim not sure im understanding you sirdo you think im stupid six feet of fake granite between him and me and i could feel droplets of his spittleim guessing  no sir the trace of a smile appeared at the corner of my mouth i couldnt help it pride of workmanship big mistakemeachams pasty face flushed you think its funny hacking into proprietary company databases to obtain confidential disbursement numbers you think its recreation its clever it doesnt countno sir —you lying sack of shit you prick its no better than stealing an old ladys purse on the fucking subwayi tried to look chastened but i could see where this conversation was going and it seemed pointlessyou stole seventyeight thousand dollars from the corporate events account for a goddamned party for your buddies on the loading docki swallowed hard shit seventyeight thousand dollars i knew it was pretty highend but i had no idea how highendthis guy in on it with youwho do you mean i think maybe youre confused about —jonesie the old guy the name on the cakejonesie had nothing to do with it i shot backmeacham leaned back looking
