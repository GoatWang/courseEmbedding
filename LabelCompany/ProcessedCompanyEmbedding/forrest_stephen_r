mar  field of invention the present invention generally relates to organic thinfilm photosensitive optoelectronic devices more specifically it is directed to organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices eg solar cells and photodetectors having transparent electrodes further it is directed to organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices having a transparent cathode which forms a low resistance interface with the adjacent organic semiconductor layer further it is directed to an organic photosensitive optoelectronic device consisting of a plurality of stacked photosensitive optoelectronic subcells each subcell having one or more photosensitive optoelectronically active layers and transparent charge transfer layers background of the invention optoelectronic devices rely on the optical and electronic properties of materials to either produce or detect electromagnetic radiation electronically or to generate electricity from ambient electromagnetic radiation photosensitive optoelectronic devices convert electromagnetic radiation into electricity solar cells also known as photovoltaic pv devices are specifically used to generate electrical power pv devices are used to drive power consuming loads to provide for example lighting heating or to operate electronic equipment such as computers or remote monitoring or communications equipment these power generation applications also often involve the charging of batteries or other energy storage devices so that equipment operation may continue when direct illumination from the sun or other ambient light sources is not available as used herein the term “resistive load” refers to any power consuming or storing device equipment or system another type of photosensitive optoelectronic device is a photoconductor cell in this function signal detection circuitry monitors the resistance of the device to detect changes due to the absorption of light another type of photosensitive optoelectronic device is a photodetector in operation a photodetector has a voltage applied and a current detecting circuit measures the current generated when the photodetector is exposed to electromagnetic radiation a detecting circuit as described herein is capable of providing a bias voltage to a photodetector and measuring the electronic response of the photodetector to ambient electromagnetic radiation these three classes of photosensitive optoelectronic devices may be characterized according to whether a rectifying junction as defined below is present and also according to whether the device is operated with an external applied voltage also known as a bias or bias voltage a photoconductor cell does not have a rectifying junction and is normally operated with a bias a pv device has at least one rectifying junction and is operated with no bias a photodetector has at least one rectifying junction and is usually but not always operated with a bias traditionally photosensitive optoelectronic devices have been constructed of a number of inorganic semiconductors eg crystalline polycrystalline and amorphous silicon gallium arsenide cadmium telluride and others herein the term “semiconductor” denotes materials which can conduct electricity when charge carriers are induced by thermal or electromagnetic excitation the term “photoconductive” generally relates to the process in which electromagnetic radiant energy is absorbed and thereby converted to excitation energy of electric charge carriers so that the carriers can conduct ie transport electric charge in a material the terms “photoconductor” and “photoconductive material” are used herein to refer to semiconductor materials which are chosen for their property of absorbing electromagnetic radiation of selected spectral energies to generate electric charge carriers solar cells are characterized by the efficiency with which they can convert incident solar power to useful electric power devices utilizing crystalline or amorphous silicon dominate commercial applications and some have achieved efficiencies of  or greater however efficient crystallinebased devices especially of large surface area are difficult and expensive to produce due to the problems inherent in producing large crystals without significant efficiencydegrading defects on the other hand high efficiency amorphous silicon devices still suffer from problems with stability more recent efforts have focused on the use of organic photovoltaic cells to achieve acceptable photovoltaic conversion efficiencies with economical production costs pv devices typically have the property that when they are connected across a load and are irradiated by light they produce a photogenerated voltage when irradiated without any external electronic load a pv device generates its maximum possible voltage v opencircuit or voc if a pv device is irradiated with its electrical contacts shorted a maximum shortcircuit current or isc is produced when actually used to generate power a pv device is connected to a finite resistive load and the power output is given by the current voltage product i×v the maximum total power generated by a pv device is inherently incapable of exceeding the product isc×voc when the load value is optimized for maximum power extraction the current and voltage have values imax and vmax respectively a figure of merit for solar cells is the fill factor ff defined as ffimax⁢vmaxisc⁢voc where ff is always less than  since in actual use isc and voc are never obtained simultaneously nonetheless as ff approaches  the device is more efficient when electromagnetic radiation of an appropriate energy is incident upon a semiconductive organic material for example an organic molecular crystal omc material or a polymer a photon can be absorbed to produce an excited molecular state this is represented symbolically as shvs here s and s denote ground and excited molecular states respectively this energy absorption is associated with the promotion of an electron from a bound state in the valence band which may be a πbond to the conduction band which may be a πbond or equivalently the promotion of a hole from the conduction band to the valence band in organic thinfilm photoconductors the generated molecular state is generally believed to be an exciton ie an electronhole pair in a bound state which is transported as a quasiparticle the excitons can have an appreciable lifetime before geminate recombination which refers to the process of the original electron and hole recombining with each other as opposed to recombination with holes or electrons from other pairs to produce a photocurrent the electronhole pair must become separated if the charges do not separate they can recombine in a geminate recombination process either radiatively—reemitting light of a lower than incident light energy— or nonradiatively—with the production of heat either of these outcomes is undesirable in a photosensitive optoelectronic device while exciton ionization or dissociation is not completely understood it is generally believed to occur in regions of electric field occurring at defects impurities contacts interfaces or other inhomogeneities frequently the ionization occurs in the electric field induced around a crystal defect denoted m this reaction is denoted sme−h if the ionization occurs at a random defect in a region of material without an overall electric field the generated electronhole pair will likely recombine to achieve a useful photocurrent the electron and hole must be collected separately at respective opposing electrodes which are frequently referred to as contacts this is achieved with the presence of an electric field in the region occupied by the carriers in power generation devices ie pv devices this is preferably achieved with the use of internally produced electric fields that separate the generated photocarriers in other photosensitive optoelectronic devices the electric field may be generated by an external bias eg in a photoconductor cell or as a result of the superposition of internally and externally generated electric fields eg in a photodetector in an organic pv device as in other photosensitive optoelectronic devices it is desirable to separate as many of the photogenerated electronhole pairs or excitons as possible the builtin electric field serves to dissociate the excitons to produce a photocurrent fig  schematically depicts the photoconductive process in organic semiconducting materials step  shows electromagnetic radiation incident upon sample of photoconductive material between two electrodes a and b in step  a photon is absorbed to generate an exciton ie electronhole pair in the bulk the solid circle schematically represents an electron while the open circle schematically represents a hole the curving lines between the hole and electron are an artistic indication that the electron and hole are in an excitonic bound state in step  the exciton diffuses within the bulk photoconductive material as indicated by the excitons closer proximity to electrode a the exciton may suffer recombination in the bulk material away from any field associated with a contact or junction as indicated in step  if this occurs the absorbed photon does not contribute to the photocurrent preferably the exciton ionizes within the field associated with a contact or junction as indicated by the progression from step  to step  however it is still possible for the newly liberated carriers to recombine as indicated in step  before permanently separating and contributing to the photocurrent preferably the carriers separate and respond to the field near a contact or junction according to the sign of their electric charge as indicated by the progression from step  to step  that is in an electric field indicated by in step  holes and electrons move in opposite directions to produce internally generated electric fields which occupy a substantial volume the usual method is to juxtapose two layers of material with appropriately selected conductive properties especially with respect to their distribution of molecular quantum energy states the interface of these two materials is called a photovoltaic heterojunction in traditional semiconductor theory materials for forming pv heterojunctions have been denoted as generally being of either n or donor type or p or acceptor type here ntype denotes that the majority carrier type is the electron this could be viewed as the material having many electrons in relatively free energy states the ptype denotes that the majority carrier type is the hole such material has many holes in relatively free energy states the type of the background ie not photogenerated majority carrier concentration depends primarily on unintentional doping by defects or impurities the type and concentration of impurities determine the value of the fermi energy or level within the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo called the homolumo gap the fermi energy characterizes the statistical occupation of molecular quantum energy states denoted by the value of energy for which the probability of occupation is equal to ½ a fermi energy near the lumo energy indicates that electrons are the predominant carrier a fermi energy near the homo energy indicates that holes are the predominant carrier accordingly the fermi energy is a primary characterizing property of traditional semiconductors and the prototypical pv heterojunction has traditionally been the pn interface in addition to relative freecarrier concentrations a significant property in organic semiconductors is carrier mobility mobility measures the ease with which a charge carrier can move through a conducting material in response to an electric field as opposed to free carrier concentrations carrier mobility is determined in large part by intrinsic properties of the organic material such as crystal symmetry and periodicity appropriate symmetry and periodicity can produce higher quantum wavefunction overlap of homo levels producing higher hole mobility or similarly higher overlap of lumo levels to produce higher electron mobility moreover the donor or acceptor nature of an organic semiconductor eg perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride ptcda may be at odds with the higher carrier mobility for example while chemistry arguments suggest a donor or ntype character for ptcda experiments indicate that hole mobilities exceed electron mobilities by several orders of magnitude so that the hole mobility is a critical factor the result is that device configuration predictions from donoracceptor criteria may not be borne out by actual device performance thus in selecting organic materials such as those described herein for photosensitive optoelectronic devices it has been found that isotype heterojunctions eg pp may have rectifying properties as good as traditional pn type heterojunctions although true pn type is generally preferable when possible isotype heterojunctions are discussed further below due to these unique electronic properties of organic materials rather than designating them as “ptype” or “ntype” the nomenclature of “holetransportinglayer” htl or “electrontransportinglayer” etl is frequently used in this designation scheme an etl will preferentially be electron conducting and an htl will preferentially be hole transporting the term “rectifying” denotes inter alia that an interface has an asymmetric conduction characteristic ie the interface supports electronic charge transport preferably in one direction rectification is associated normally with a builtin electric field which occurs at the heterojunction between appropriately selected materials the electrodes or contacts used in a photosensitive optoelectronic device are an important consideration in a photosensitive optoelectronic device it is desirable to allow the maximum amount of ambient electromagnetic radiation from the device exterior to be admitted to the photoconductively active interior region that is it is desirable to get the electromagnetic radiation to where it can be converted to electricity by photoconductive absorption this indicates that at least one of the electrical contacts should be minimally absorbing and minimally reflecting of the incident electromagnetic radiation that is the contact should be substantially transparent when used herein the terms “electrode” and “contact” refer only to layers that provide a medium for delivering photogenerated power to an external circuit or providing a bias voltage to the device that is an electrode or contact provides the interface between the photoconductively active regions of an organic photosensitive optoelectronic device and a wire lead trace or other means for transporting the charge carriers to or from the external circuit the term “charge transfer layer” is used herein to refer to layers similar to but different from electrodes in that a charge transfer layer only delivers charge carriers from one subsection of an optoelectronic device to the adjacent subsection as used herein a layer of material or a sequence of several layers of different materials is said to be “transparent” when the layer or layers permit at least  of the ambient electromagnetic radiation in relevant wavelengths to be transmitted through the layer or layers when an electrode or charge transfer layer provides the primary mechanism for photovoltaic charge separation the device is called a schottky device as discussed further below electrodes or contacts are usually metals or “metal substitutes” herein the term “metal” is used to embrace both materials composed of an elementally pure metal eg mg and also metal alloys which are materials composed of two or more elementally pure metals eg mg and ag together denoted mgag here the term “metal substitute” refers to a material that is not a metal within the normal definition but which has the metallike properties that are desired in certain appropriate applications commonly used metal substitutes for electrodes and charge transfer layers would include wide bandgap semiconductors for example transparent conducting oxides such as indium tin oxide ito tin oxide to gallium indium tin oxide gito zinc oxide zo and zinc indium tin oxide zito in particular ito is a highly doped degenerate n semiconductor with an optical bandgap of approximately  ev rendering it transparent to wavelengths greater than approximately  å another suitable metal substitute material is the transparent conductive polymer polyanaline pani and its chemical relatives metal substitutes may be further selected from a wide range of nonmetallic materials wherein the term “nonmetallic” is meant to embrace a wide range of materials provided that the material is free of metal in its chemically uncombined form when a metal is present in its chemically uncombined form either alone or in combination with one or more other metals as an alloy the metal may alternatively be referred to as being present in its metallic form or as being a “free metal” thus the metal substitute electrodes of the present invention may sometimes be referred to by one or more of the inventors of the present invention as “metalfree” wherein the term “metalfree” is expressly meant to embrace a material free of metal in its chemically uncombined form free metals typically have a form of metallic bonding that may be thought of as a type of chemical bonding that results from a sea of valence electrons which are free to move in an electronic conduction band throughout the metal lattice while metal substitutes may contain metal constituents they are “nonmetallic” on several bases they are not pure freemetals nor are they alloys of freemetals further these metal substitutes do not have their fermi level in a band of conducting states in contrast with true metals when metals are present in their metallic form the electronic conduction band tends to provide among other metallic properties a high electrical conductivity as well as a high reflectivity for optical radiation another characteristic of metallic conductors is the temperature dependence of their conductivity metals generally have a high conductivity at room temperature which increases as the temperature is lowered to near absolute zero metal substitutes for example semiconductors including inter alia inorganic organic amorphous or crystalline generally have conductivities which decrease as their temperature is lowered to near absolute zero there are two basic organic photovoltaic device configurations the first type is the schottkytype cell with a single species of organic photoconductive material sandwiched between a pair of metal andor metal substitute contacts conventionally for ntype photoconductors a high work function metal eg au has been used as the schottky contact and for ptype photoconductors a metal with a low work function eg al mg or in has been used as the schottky contact the charge separation desired in a pv device is induced by exciton dissociation in the spacecharge region associated with the builtin electric field at the metalphotoconductor interface conventionally such a device requires different metal or metal substitute pair combinations as contacts since use of the same material at both interfaces would ostensibly produce opposing rectifying junctions if the same material is used for both electrodes it has been generally thought that the fields generated at the photoconductorelectrode interfaces are necessarily equal in magnitude and opposite in direction so that no net photocurrent is generated in the absence of an external applied voltage while it is possible for charge separation to occur at both interfaces and be additive it is generally preferable to have all charge separation occurring at one interface for example this can be achieved if the nonrectifying interface has little or no barrier to carrier transport ie if it is a relatively low resistance contact this may also be referred to as an “ohmic” contact in any event in photosensitive optoelectronic devices it is generally desirable that the interfaces either contribute to the net charge separating action or present the smallest possible resistance or barrier to carrier transport a

separation and high charge carrier mobilities” molecular crystals and liquid crystals vol  pp   hereinafter karl et al karl et al noted that while the ag electrode a was photovoltaically active in such a cell the ito electrode very rarely was photoactive and further that the indications of photovoltaic action at the ito electrode had poor statistical certainty further one of ordinary skill in the art would expect contact a not to be transparent the second type of photovoltaic device configuration is the organic bilayer cell in the bilayer cell charge separation predominantly occurs at the organic heterojunction the builtin potential is determined by the homolumo gap energy difference between the two materials contacting to form the heterojunction an isotype heterojunction has been discussed in an article by s r forrest l y leu f f so and w y yoon “optical and electrical properties of isotype crystalline molecular organic heterojunctions” journal of applied physics vol  no   hereinafter “forrest leu et al” and in an article by forrest s r “ultrathin organic films grown by organic molecular beam deposition and related techniques” chemical reviews vol  no   hereinafter forrest chem rev  both of which are incorporated herein by reference forrest leu et al describe two isotype solar cells depicted in fig b and fig c fig b shows a device consisting of an ito electrode b on a substrate b covered with a layer b of copper phthalocyanine cupc and a layer b of ptcda with a top electrode b of in in a second device with reference to fig c an ito electrode c is again placed on a substrate c then a cupc layer c and a perylenetetracarboxylicbisbenzimidazole ptcbi layer c are placed in order with a ag electrode c on top this prior art had only one transparent electrode and it was on the bottom of the device it was also noted in this reference that these organic photovoltaic devices suffered from a high series resistance as in the case of schottky devices unless an interface at a contact for example is contributing to the charge separation it is desirable that the interface produce the smallest possible obstruction to free current flow in bilayer devices since the dominant charge separating region is located near the heterojunction it is desirable for the interfaces at the electrodes to have the smallest possible resistance in particular it is known in the art to use thin metal layers as low resistance or ohmic electrodes or contacts when ohmic contacts are desired a high work function metal eg au has been used as the positive electrode ie anode in photosensitive optoelectronic devices similarly a low work function metal eg al mg or in has been used to make an ohmic negative electrode ie cathode herein the term “cathode” is used in the following manner in a pv device under ambient irradiation and connected with a resistive load and with no externally applied voltage eg a solar cell electrons move to the cathode from the adjacent photoconducting material with an applied bias voltage electrons may move from the cathode to the adjacent photoconducting material or vice versa depending on the direction and magnitude of the applied voltage for example under “forwardbias” a negative bias is applied to the cathode if the magnitude of the forwardbias equals that of the internally generated potential there will be no net current through the device if the forwardbias potential exceeds the internal potential in magnitude there will be a current in the opposite direction from the nonbiased situation in this later forwardbias situation electrons move from the cathode into the adjacent photoconductive organic layer under “reversebias” a positive bias is applied to the cathode and any electrons which can move do so in the same direction as in the no bias situation a reversebiased device generally has little or no current flow until it is irradiated similarly the term “anode” is used herein such that in a solar cell under illumination holes move to the anode from the adjacent photoconducting material which is equivalent to electrons moving in the opposite manner the application of an external voltage to the device structure will alter the flow of the carriers at the anodephotoconductor interface in a complementary fashion to that described for the cathode and in a manner understood by those of ordinary skill in the art it will be noted that as the terms are used herein anodes and cathodes may be electrodes or charge transfer layers further as discussed above in nonschottky photosensitive optoelectronic devices it is similarly desirable for the electrodes not merely to form ohmic contacts but also to have high optical transparency transparency requires both low reflectivity and low absorption metals have the desired low resistance contact properties however they can produce significant conversion efficiency reductions due to reflection of ambient radiation away from the device also metal electrodes can absorb significant amounts of electromagnetic radiation especially in thick layers therefore it has been desirable to find low resistance high transparency electrode materials and structures in particular the metal substitute ito has the desired optical properties it is also known in the art that ito functions well as an anode in organic optoelectronic devices however it had not been previously thought that ito or other metal substitutes could make low resistance cathodes for organic optoelectronic devices solar cells had been disclosed in which a highly transparent ito layer may have functioned as a cathode in some cases but such ito cathodes were only disclosed as having been prepared by depositing the chargecarrying organic layer onto the ito layer by karl et al and whitlock j b panayotatos p sharma g d cox m d savers r r and bird g r “investigations of materials and device structures for organic semiconductor solar cells” optical eng vol  no   august  whitlock et al prior art pv devices eg figs a and b have only utilized nonmetallic materials eg indium tin oxide ito as one electrode of the photovoltaic device the other electrode has traditionally been a nontransparent metallic layer eg aluminum indium gold tin silver magnesium lithium etc or their alloys selected on the basis of work function as discussed above us pat no  to forrest s r et al hereinafter forrest  incorporated herein by reference describes a technique for fabricating organic photoemissive devices toleds transparent organic light emitting diodes having a transparent cathode deposited onto an organic etl by depositing a thin metallic layer eg mgag onto the organic etl and then sputter depositing an ito layer onto the mgag layer such a cathode having the ito layer sputter deposited onto a mgag layer is referred to herein as a “composite itomgag cathode” the composite itomgag cathode has high transmission as well as low resistance properties it is known in the art of inorganic solar cells to stack multiple photovoltaic cells to create an inorganic multisection solar cell with transparent metallic layers for example us pat no  to frass hereinafter “frass ” discloses a stacked cell arrangement however the photolithographic techniques used to fabricate inorganic electronic devices are typically inapplicable to production of organic optoelectronic devices photolithography generally involves deposition of metallic layers and inorganic semiconductive layers followed by additional steps of masking and etching the etching steps involve use of strong solvents which can dissolve the relatively fragile organic semiconductor materials that are suitable for organic photovoltaic devices therefore organic photosensitive optoelectronic device fabrication techniques typically avoid this type of liquid etching process in which deposited material is removed after an organic layer has been deposited instead device layers are generally deposited sequentially with techniques such as evaporation or sputtering access to electrodes is generally implemented using masking or dry etching during deposition this constraint presents a challenge to fabrication of a stacked organic optoelectronic device for which electrode access to the intervening layers in the stack is desired thus it is believed that all prior art stacked cells have the individual photovoltaic cells electrically connected internally and only in series for inorganic photovoltaic devices series connection is not particularly disadvantageous however due to the high series resistance of the organic photovoltaic devices noted above a series configuration is undesirable for power applications due to the reduced efficiency forrest chem rev  reported that high series resistance in organic solar cells leads to spacecharge buildup as power levels are raised with increasing incident light intensity this leads to degradation of the photocurrent imax effectively reducing the fill factor and therefore the efficiency moreover what is believed to be the only previously disclosed organic solar cell with more than one photovoltaic subcell was a tandem ie two pv subcells with the subcells connected in series see effect of thin gold interstitiallayer on the photovoltaic properties of tandem organic solar cell hiramoto m suezaki m yokoyama m chemistry letters   hereinafter “hiramoto” referring to fig d substrate d is glass d is ito d is meptc  å d is hpc  å d is au  å d is meptc  å and d is hpc  å in addition there is an au  å electrode not shown on top of the layer d this device has the subcells electrically connected internally and in series thus avoiding the problem of devising a means to make external contact to an electrode within the middle of a stack of organic semiconducting material hiramotos organic tandem devices have just two electrodes one on top and bottom used to make external connections plus recombination layer d which electrically “floats” between the two subcells only one of the electrodes bottom ito layer d was transparent top au layer not shown was  å thick and therefore nontransparent further for the reasons noted above series connection is not an optimal configuration in stacked organic photovoltaic devices for high power applications a solar cell may be viewed as a photodiode with no applied bias the internal electric field generates a photocurrent when light is incident on the solar cell and the current drives a resistive load for the extraction of power on the other hand a photodetector may be viewed as a diode with no externally applied bias voltage or a finite externally applied bias voltage when electromagnetic radiation is incident upon a photodetector with a bias the current increases from its dark value to a value proportional to the number of photogenerated carriers and the increase may be measured with external circuitry if a photodiode is operated with no applied bias an external circuit may be used to measure the photogenerated voltage and achieve photodetection while the same general configuration of electrodes charge transfer layers and photoconductive layers may be used alternatively as a solar cell or as a photodetector a configuration optimized for one purpose is generally not optimal for another for example photosensitive optoelectronic devices produced as solar cells are designed to convert as much of the available solar spectrum as possible to electricity therefore a broad spectral response over the entire visible spectrum is desirable on the other hand a photodetector may be desired which has a photosensitive response over a narrow spectral range or over a range outside the visible spectrum organic pv devices typically have relatively low quantum yield the ratio of photons absorbed to carrier pairs generated or electromagnetic radiation to electricity conversion efficiency being on the order of  or less this is in part thought to be due to the second order nature of the intrinsic photoconductive process that is carrier generation requires exciton generation diffusion and ionization as described above in order to increase these yields materials and device configurations are desirable which can enhance the quantum yield and therefore the power conversion efficiency forrest chem rev  and arbour c

electrodes in particular devices that include an organic photosensitive optoelectronic cell comprised of at least one pair of two transparent electrodes that is a transparent cathode and a transparent anode or devices that have a transparent electrode in superposed relationship upon the top surface of a substrate with at least one photoconductive organic layer disposed between the electrode and the substrate more specifically the organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices of the present invention may be comprised of a transparent cathode that is highly transparent andor highly efficient as representative embodiments such transparent cathodes may be the highly transparent highly efficient andor low resistance nonmetallic or metallicnonmetallic composite cathodes such as disclosed in the copending application ser nos  now us pat no  hereinafter “parthasarathy ” and  now us pat no  hereinafter “parthasarathy ” or in forrest  each of which being incorporated in its entirety by reference the organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices of the present invention may function as a solar cell photodetector or photocell whenever the organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices of the present invention function as solar cells the materials used in the photoconductive organic layer or layers and the thicknesses thereof may be selected for example to optimize the external quantum efficiency of the device whenever the organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices of the present invention function as photodetectors or photocells the materials used in the photoconductive organic layer or layers and the thicknesses thereof may be selected for example to maximize the sensitivity of the device to desired spectral regions in each case use of transparent electrodes or even only a transparent top electrode makes it possible for substantially higher external quantum efficiencies andor photosensitivities in selected spectral regions to be realized compared to when one or more of the electrodes can cause substantial transmission losses due to absorption andor reflection losses in addition to the organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices that may be comprised of two transparent electrodes or a transparent top electrode the present invention is further directed to organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices having the unique geometric and electrical configurations that may be fabricated using stacked cells with transparent electrodes in particular the organic photosensitive optoelectronic device may be a stacked device comprised of a plurality of subcells in superposed relation to each other on the surface of a substrate the materials and thicknesses of the individual subcells may be selected for example together with selecting the total number of subcells that are included in the stacked photosensitive optoelectronic device so as to optimize the external quantum efficiency of the photosensitive optoelectronic device in particular for stacked photosensitive optoelectronic devices configured to be electrically connected in parallel the thicknesses of the individual subcells may be adjusted so that in combination with selecting the total number of subcells in the stacked device the external quantum efficiency of the device may be optimized so as to obtain an external quantum efficiency that is higher than that which is possible for a single cell the term “external quantum efficiency” is used herein to refer to the efficiency with which a photosensitive optoelectronic device is capable of converting the total incident radiation into electrical power as distinct from the term “internal quantum efficiency” which is used herein to refer to the efficiency with which a photosensitive optoelectronic device is capable of converting the absorbed radiation into electrical power using these terms a stacked photosensitive optoelectronic device with an electrically parallel configuration may be designed to achieve an external quantum efficiency under a given set of ambient radiation conditions that approaches the maximum internal quantum efficiency that may be achieved for an individual subcell under such ambient conditions this result may be achieved by considering several guidelines that may be used in the selection of layer thicknesses it is desirable for the exciton diffusion length ld to be greater than or comparable to the layer thickness l since it is believed that most exciton dissociation will occur at an interface if ld is less than l then many excitons may recombine before dissociation it is further desirable for the total photoconductive layer thickness to be of the order of the electromagnetic radiation absorption length α where α is the absorption coefficient so that nearly all of the radiation incident on the solar cell is absorbed to produce excitons however the layer thicknesses should not be so large compared to the extent of the heterojunction electric fields that many excitons get generated in a fieldfree region one reason for this is that the fields help to dissociate the excitons another reason is that if an exciton dissociates in a fieldfree region it is more likely to suffer geminant recombination and contribute nothing to the photocurrent furthermore the photoconductive layer thickness should be as thin as possible to avoid excess series resistance due to the high bulk resistivity of organic semiconductors accordingly these competing guidelines inherently require tradeoffs to be made in selecting the thickness of the photoconductive organic layers of a photosensitive optoelectronic cell thus on the one hand a thickness that is comparable or larger than the absorption length is desirable in order to absorb the maximum amount of incident radiation on the other hand as the photoconductive layer thickness increases two undesirable effects are increased one is that due to the high series resistance of organic semiconductors an increased organic layer thickness increases device resistance and reduces efficiency another undesirable effect is that increasing the photoconductive layer thickness increases the likelihood that excitons will be generated far from the effective field at a chargeseparating interface resulting in enhanced probability of geminate recombination and again reduced efficiency therefore a device configuration is desirable which balances between these competing effects in a manner that produces a high quantum efficiency for the overall device in particular by taking the abovenoted competing effects into account that is the absorption length of the photoconductive materials in the device the diffusion length of the excitons in these materials the photocurrent generation efficiency of these excitons and the resistivity of these materials the thickness of the layers in an individual cell may be adjusted so as to obtain a maximum internal quantum efficiency for those particular materials for a given set of ambient radiation conditions since the diffusion length of the excitons tends to have a relatively small value and the resistivity of typical photoconductive materials tends to be relatively large an optimal subcell with respect to achieving the maximum internal quantum efficiency would typically be a relatively thin device however since the absorption length for such photoconductive organic materials tends to be relatively large as compared with the exciton diffusion length such thin optimal photosensitive optoelectronic subcells which may have the maximum internal quantum efficiency would tend to have a relatively low external quantum efficiency since only a small fraction of the incident radiation would be absorbed by such optimal subcells so as to improve the external quantum efficiency of an individual subcell the thickness of the photoconductive organic layers may be increased so as to absorb significantly more incident radiation although the internal quantum efficiency for converting the additionally absorbed radiation into electrical power might gradually decrease as the thickness is increased beyond its optimal subcell thickness the external quantum efficiency of the subcell would still increase until a certain thickness is reached where no further increase in absorption could produce an increase in external quantum efficiency since the internal quantum efficiency of the subcell tends to drop rather sharply as the thickness of the photoconductive layers increases much beyond the diffusion length of the photogenerated excitons the maximum external quantum efficiency of the subcell may be achieved well before the thickness of the thicker subcell is sufficient to absorb substantially all the incident radiation thus the maximum external quantum efficiency that may be achieved using this single thickercell approach is limited not only by the fact that the subcell thickness may be significantly greater than that desired for achieving the maximum internal quantum efficiency but in addition such thicker subcells may still not absorb all the incident radiation thus due to both of these effects the maximum external quantum efficiency of the thicker subcell would be expected to be significantly less than the maximum internal quantum efficiency that can be achieved for an optimal subcell having the optimal thickness a particular feature of the present invention having the stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic device with the electrically parallel configuration is that instead of attempting to improve the external quantum efficiency by increasing the thickness of a single subcell which sacrifices the internal quantum efficiency subcells that have a thickness that is optimal or near optimal for achieving the maximum internal quantum efficiency may be used to fabricate a stacked structure the total number of such optimal subcells that are included in the stacked structure may be increased so as to provide an increase in absorption of the incident radiation with the total number being limited by that which produces no further increase in the external quantum efficiency the net result of this approach for improving the external quantum efficiency is that a stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic device can be made to have an external quantum efficiency approaching the maximum value of the internal quantum efficiency that can be achieved for an individual optimal subcell the improved external quantum efficiency of the stacked devices may be attributed in large part to the fact that the subcells of the stacked device may be comprised of pairs of transparent electrodes and in some cases also of a transparent top electrode taking into account that the additional subcells of the stacked device tend to introduce additional losses such as that due to the residual reflectivity of the transparent electrodes the maximum external quantum efficiency that can be achieved for a fully optimized stacked device would typically be somewhat less than the internal quantum efficiency of an optimal subcell nevertheless using the methods of the present invention for optimizing the external quantum efficiency of an organic photosensitive optoelectronic device substantially higher external quantum efficiencies may be achieved for a stacked device than are possible for a device having a single cell which is optimized for external quantum efficiency at the expense of internal quantum efficiency since the organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices of the present invention may be desired for widely varying ambient radiation conditions for example with respect to the intensity of incident radiation andor with respect to the spectral distribution of the incident radiation the photoconductive organic materials and the layer thicknesses thereof may be selected so as to be optimized for a given set of ambient conditions for example the photoconductive organic materials may be selected to have absorption maxima in selected spectral regions since the photoconductive organic materials that may be used in a photosensitive optoelectronic cell may typically have absorption maxima only over a limited spectral range it is an additional feature of the present invention that the stacked photosensitive optoelectronic devices may be comprised of different types of cells having photoconductive organic materials with different absorption characteristics so as to more effectively utilize the entire spectral range of the incident radiation when the term “subcell” is used hereafter it may refer to an organic photosensitive optoelectronic construction of the unilayer bilayer or multilayer type when a subcell is used individually as a photosensitive optoelectronic device it typically includes a complete set of electrodes ie positive and negative as disclosed herein in some stacked configurations it is possible for adjacent subcells to utilize common ie shared electrode or charge transfer layers in other cases adjacent subcells do not share common electrodes or charge transfer layers the term “subcell” is disclosed herein to encompass the subunit construction regardless of whether each subunit has its own distinct electrodes or shares electrodes or charge transfer layers with adjacent subunits herein the terms “cell” “subcell” “unit” “subunit” “section” and “subsection” are used interchangeably to refer to a photoconductive layer or set of layers and the adjoining electrodes or charge transfer layers as used herein the terms “stack” “stacked” “multisection” and “multicell” refer to any optoelectronic device with multiple layers of a photoconductive material separated by one or more electrode or charge transfer layers since the stacked subcells of the solar cell may be fabricated using vacuum deposition techniques that allow external electrical connections to be made to the electrodes separating the subcells each of the subcells in the device may be electrically connected either in parallel or in series depending on whether the power andor voltage generated by the solar cell is to be maximized the improved external quantum efficiency that may be achieved for the stacked solar cells of the present invention may also be attributed to the fact that the subcells of the stacked solar cell may be electrically connected in parallel since a parallel electrical configuration permits substantially higher fill factors to be realized than when the subcells are connected in series it is believed that this parallel electrical configuration of the stacked subcells is a further unique aspect of the present invention although the high series resistance of photoconductive organic materials inhibits use of subcells in a series configuration for high power applications there are certain applications for example in operating liquid crystal displays lcd for which a higher voltage may be required but only at low current and thus at low power levels for this type of application stacked seriesconnected solar cells may be suitable for providing the required voltage to the lcd in the case when the solar cell is comprised of subcells electrically connected in series so as to produce such a higher voltage device the stacked solar cell may be fabricated so as to have each subcell producing approximately the same current so to reduce inefficiency for example if the incident radiation passes through in only one direction the stacked subcells may have an increasing thickness with the outermost subcell which is most directly exposed to the incident radiation being the thinnest alternatively if the subcells are superposed on a reflective surface the thicknesses of the individual subcells may be adjusted to account for the total combined radiation admitted to each subcell from the original and reflected directions further it may be desirable to have a direct current power supply capable of producing a number of different voltages for this application external connections to intervening electrodes could have great utility and are not believed to have been previously disclosed accordingly in addition to being capable of providing the maximum voltage that is generated across the entire set of subcells the stacked solar cells of the present invention may also be used to provide multiple voltages from a single power source by tapping a selected voltage from a selected subset of subcells the present invention may be further described as being directed toward a method of fabricating photosensitive optoelectronic devices comprising fabricating a first photosensitive optoelectronic subcell on a substrate so as to form a photosensitive optoelectronic cell

subcell are electrically connected in series the present invention may be further described as being directed toward a method of fabricating a parallel stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic device comprising fabricating a first organic photosensitive optoelectronic subcell on a substrate so as to form an organic photosensitive optoelectronic device capable of producing a given external quantum efficiency and fabricating a second organic photosensitive optoelectronic subcell in superposed relationship upon the top surface of the first organic photosensitive optoelectronic subcell so as to form a stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic device so that the external quantum efficiency capability of the organic photosensitive optoelectronic device is increased wherein the first subcell and the second subcell are electrically connected in parallel the present invention may be further described as being directed toward a mixed electrical configuration stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic device comprising a substrate having a proximal surface and a distal surface and a plurality of subassemblies of organic photosensitive optoelectronic subcells each of the subcells having a cathode and an anode each of the cathode and anode being an electrode layer or a charge transfer layer the subcells in superposed relation with each other and with the distal

connected in series wherein the first stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic subassembly and the second stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic subassembly are electrically connected in parallel representative embodiments may also comprise transparent charge transfer layers as described herein charge transfer layers are distinguished from etl and htl layers by the fact that charge transfer layers are frequently but not necessarily inorganic and they are generally chosen not to be photoconductively active that is the electrodes and charge transfer layers preferably do not absorb electromagnetic radiation for conversion to electrical or thermal forms of energy therefore transparent low reflectivity electrodes and charge transfer layers are generally preferred in the present invention in addition the electrode and charge transfer layer electronic properties are important in certain device configurations one or more of the electrodes or charge transfer layers may be electronically active for example as discussed above an electrode or charge transfer layer may provide an interfacial region for dissociating or recombining excitons or it may provide a rectifying interface in other device configurations it is desired that the electrode or charge transfer layer have minimal electronic activity and instead serve primarily as a low resistance means for delivering the photogenerated current to the external circuitry or to the adjacent subsection of a multisection device moreover in pv devices high contact or charge transfer layer resistance is detrimental in many applications since the resulting increased series resistance limits power output the preferred embodiments of the present invention include as one or more of the transparent electrodes of the optoelectronic device a highly transparent nonmetallic low resistance cathode such as disclosed in parthasarathy  or a highly efficient low resistance metallicnonmetallic composite cathode such as disclosed in forrest  each type of cathode is preferably prepared in a fabrication process that includes the step of sputter depositing an ito layer onto either an organic material such as copper phthalocyanine cupc ptcda and ptcbi to form a highly transparent nonmetallic low resistance cathode or onto a thin mgag layer to form a highly efficient low resistance metallicnonmetallic composite cathode parthasarathy  discloses that an ito layer onto which an organic layer had been deposited instead of an organic layer onto which the ito layer had been deposited does not function as an efficient cathode in summary it is an object of the present invention to provide an organic photosensitive optoelectronic device with two transparent electrodes more specifically it is an object of

significantly that the conventional picture of opposing mirrorimage schottky barriers is altered parthasarathy  discloses that the surface states which may be defects may effectively provide small energy “steps” that allow electrons to more easily traverse what would otherwise be for example a schottky barrier one theory of unilayer device operation is that deposition of electrode  onto organic

optoelectronic bilayer device  represents an embodiment of a photosensitive optoelectronic device accordingly the thicknesses of the photoconductive organic materials are adjusted to the requirements of a photosensitive optoelectronic device and during operation electrons flow from second organic layer  into second electrode a without being limited to this particular theory it was typically believed by one skilled in the art that metal substitute electrodes eg ito would create a barrier to electron flow in both directions ie into or out of the device when such materials were used as cathodes the low resistance operation of the ito cathode in the present invention demonstrates that the surface states proposed in parthasarathy  are effective in reducing the barrier to electron flow in either direction at an ito cathode made in accord with the present invention of parthasarathy  although first organic layer  and second organic layer  may be interchanged in some cases and still obtain a working device with only a reversal of polarity these embodiments are less preferred due to the reduced efficiency of a device whenever the metal substitute electrode is used as the bottom cathode the surface states believed to effectively reduce the barrier at an ito cathode are not thought to be produced when the organic thin film is deposited onto the ito layer the term “low resistance metal substitute cathode” is thus used herein to refer to a metal substitute eg ito prepared by sputter depositing a metal substitute eg ito onto an organic layer in particular as distinct from an electrode prepared by depositing an organic layer onto a metal substitute eg ito it is believed herein that the barrierreducing effect of surface states also can function to permit holes to traverse what would otherwise be blocking junctions at an interface between an organic semiconductor layer and an electrode or charge transfer layer embodiment b utilizes a transparent metallicnonmetallic composite cathode comprised of layers b and b here again as an embodiment particularly suited for use as a solar cell during operation electrons generated near the  interface move toward layer b and move through layer b for extraction it is noted in particular that whenever the ito is sputter deposited onto a given thickness of mgag the metallicnonmetallic composite cathode of mgagito has substantially higher transparency than a noncomposite metallic layer having the same given thickness as the metallic part of the composite electrode further the composite transparent composite layer may have better electronic properties than the lower resistance highly transparent nonmetallic cathode thus while the transmission of the metallicnonmetallic composite electrode is typically not as high the highlytransmissive low resistance metal substitute cathode the transmission is still sufficient in combination with the superior electronic properties for such metallicnonmetallic cathodes to be useful in the photosensitive optoelectronic devices of the present invention in the bilayer cell charge separation occurs in the vicinity of the organic heterojunction whose builtin potential is determined by the size of the homolumo gap energy difference between the contacting materials here first organic layer  and second organic layer  fig  depicts the relative homolumo gaps of exemplary materials for an isotype heterojunction eg cupcptcda the proximity of the fermi energy ef to the homo band shows that all of these materials have holes as the majority carrier the homo offset is equal to the difference of ionization potentials ip of the two contacting materials and the lumo offset is equal to the homo offset plus the difference in homolumo gap energies ehl of the two materials the polarity of the device is generally determined by the homolumo energy differences for example in fig  since the lumo of the ptcda first organic layer  is higher in energy than that in the cupc second organic layer  electrons that are liberated from an exciton will move from the ptcda  into the cupc  and contribute to the photocurrent absorption can occur in either of the two organic films thereby extending the width of the photoactive region where optical absorption can result in efficient charge separation by the builtin field note that it is not critical whether a “pn”like junction or a simple isotype ie pp or nn heterojunction is employed since it is only the diffusion potential created at the heterojunction due to the homolumo gap offsets that is effective in carrier drift in the bilayer cells any rectifying effect of the organic materialelectrode junction is much less significant than that occurring at the bilayer heterojunction further since the damage layer which occurs when eg ito is deposited over an organic material is significant in causing exciton ionization this damage may be controlled using the low power sputtering technique described in parthasarathy  it is believed that controlling this damage region will insure that exciton ionization and carrier separation primarily occurs at the organicorganic bilayer heterojunction an exemplary embodiment of an organic photosensitive optoelectronic cell with multiple organic layers or a multilayer device  is shown in fig  insulating or conducting substrate  supports the device first electrode  comprises eg ito of approximate thickness  å preferably less than  å and most preferably around  å and is adjacent to first organic layer  comprising eg ptcda ptcbi or cupc of approximate thickness  å a second organic layer  comprises eg ′bisnnapthylnphenylaminobiphenyl αnpd approximately  å in thickness and is adjacent to first organic layer  a third organic layer  comprising eg aluminum trishydroxyquinoline alq approximately  å in thickness is adjacent to second organic layer  to form a rectifying heterojunction at the second organic layer third organic layer  interface a fourth organic layer  comprising eg cupc ptcbi or ptcda of approximate thickness  å is adjacent to third organic layer  finally second transparent electrode  is adjacent to the fourth organic layer  and comprises eg ito of approximate thickness  å preferably less than  å and most preferably around  å in this embodiment an extra pair of organic materials here second organic layer  and third organic layer  selected to have appropriate relative mobilities and homolumo offset for exciton ionization and charge separation is placed within a “sandwich” of two other organic materials here first organic layer  and fourth organic layer  in this instance the “inner” pair of organic materials  and  provides the exciton ionization and charge separation and the “outer” pair  and  serves both as charge transporting layers ie transporting the separated carriers to the proper electrodes for substantially ohmic extraction and as protective cap layers ie protecting the inner pair of organic layers from damage during deposition and use the outer pair of organic materials may be from the group consisting of cupc ptcda and ptcbi or any two of the three may be used that is the same material or any combination thereof may be used for both contacts note however in embodiment  the interior pair of layers  and  are preferably deposited so that the cathode side is on top so as to incorporate a low resistance cathode however as with the exemplary embodiment of fig a the order of the deposition of the inner pair of organic materials is not critical electronically though the order of the inner pair determines the polarity of the photosensitive optoelectronic device since the outer pair of organic layers is relatively thin their electronic properties are of much less significance here than in the bilayer exemplary embodiment described herein above wherein the cupc ptcda and ptcbi also performed photoconversion and exciton ionization in addition to transporting the separated carriers accordingly an alternate embodiment of the present invention not depicted in a multilayer device would include the cathode on the bottom the inner pair of organic materials may each be an organic dye chosen to have photosensitivity in a desired region of the spectrum since the alqαnpd pair is photosensitive in the ultraviolet uv part of the spectrum multilayer device  with this organic pair combination is a particular exemplary embodiment of a uv photodetector further the dye pair is preferably chosen to have a lumohomo gap offset as described above in yet another embodiment not shown one or both of the outer pair of organic layers is replaced with a thin layer approximately a of mgag alloy which acts as a charge transfer extraction and protective cap layer a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in fig  which depicts a stacked singleorganiclayer unilayer photosensitive optoelectronic arrangement  wherein the individual unilayer subcells are electrically connected in parallel insulating or conductive substrate  provides support for the stacked photosensitive optoelectronic device the stack shown consists of three complete unilayer photosensitive optoelectronic subcells separated by transparent insulating layers specifically each subcell has a first transparent electrode eg ito a b and c on top of each first ito electrode there are organic layers a b and c then on top of each organic layer is a second ito electrode a b c since the damage layer which produces the required device asymmetry is always developed at the interface where ito is deposited onto an organic material all of the devices will have the same electrical polarity with respect to the direction of material deposition that is the subcells are inherently deposited in an electrically series configuration such a series configuration may be useful in low power applications as discussed above also in accord with the present invention external connections are possible to the intervening electrodes to allow for the availability of multiple voltages from a single device comprising stacked unilayer subcells this embodiment is not illustrated however a parallel electrical arrangement is preferable for high power applications in view of the series resistance and space charge effects discussed above this means that the subcells may not share common ito electrodes as is possible in the bilayer stacks discussed below therefore in the embodiment shown in fig  transparent insulating layers a and b are provided to separate the adjacent subcells this allows all the first ito electrodes a b and c to be connected to a common electrical path similarly all the second ito electrodes a b and c are connected to a common electrical path it can be appreciated that the stack could be continued to include a number of subcells stacked unilayer devices may be optimized according to the criteria disclosed herein to eg maximize total voltage quantum efficiency or power stacking beyond a thickness in which substantially all incident light is absorbed will not further increase conversion efficiency two exemplary embodiments a and b are shown in figs a and b embodiment a comprises several bilayer photosensitive optoelectronic devices arranged so that their polarity alternates as a function of position in the stack insulating or conductive substrate  provides support layers a b and c are photosensitive optoelectronic subcell first transparent electrodes comprising eg ito they may also be some other transparent oxide or a metal layers a b c and d are photosensitive optoelectronic subcell first organic layers comprising eg cupc layers a b c and d are photosensitive optoelectronic subcell second organic layers comprising eg ptcda or ptcbi layers a and b are photosensitive optoelectronic subcell second transparent electrodes comprising eg ito layer thickness ranges are the same as those given for the individual bilayer subcell embodiment described with respect to fig a since the subcells are deposited backtoback all electrodes within the interior of the stack ie b and a and b are contacts to two different subcells and the entire stack arrangement is electrically connected in parallel as used herein the term “backtoback” is used to indicate that adjacent subcells have antiparallel polarities it can be appreciated here as well that the stack could be continued to include an arbitrary number of subcells to increase the photocurrent however stacking beyond a thickness in which substantially all incident light is absorbed will not further increase conversion efficiency also the choice of which organic layer to deposit first is not critical though it does determine the stack ordering thereafter for a given stacked device in another exemplary embodiment b of a stacked device of several backtoback subcells electrode layers a b and c are augmented as now described in order to take advantage where possible of the beneficial effect of a thin metallic layer combined with a layer of ito using what is herein referred to as a metallicnonmetallic composite electrode thin semitransparent metallic layers eg mgag are added in several places metallic layer b is adjacent to ito layer a metallic layers b and b are adjacent to ito layer b metallic layer b is adjacent to ito layer c it is appreciated that in the electronically backtoback configuration of stacked bilayer device a the subcell cathodes necessarily are alternately on top of the individual subcells as the stack is built from bottom up this means that not all subcells will have what is referred to herein as the low resistance nonmetallic cathode in yet another embodiment not shown the subcells may be deposited with the organic layers in nonalternating order as just described but with additional transparent electrode layers and insulating layers between the individual subcells in a manner similar to that described above for the unilayer device in this embodiment the subcells may be connected externally in parallel and also have the cathode always on top to take advantage of the low resistance nonmetallic cathode in other embodiments a bilayer stacked device may be constructed in which the subcells are in series by not alternating the order of the two organic layers in accord with the present invention such devices may have external connections to electrodes between subunits or may have the subunits interconnected by charge transfer layers and isolated from external circuits fig c depicts a series connected device c with intervening electrodes layers a b c d are arranged to be on top of layers a b c and d in each of their respective subcells this means that each subcell is arranged to have an etl eg cupc on top of a htl eg ptcda or ptcbi so that each subcell has the cathode on top this means that this embodiment is arranged to take advantage of the low resistance nonmetallic cathode device c provides a plurality of negative voltages vl    n where n is the number of subcells n is depicted in fig c note also that each available voltage vli is the sum of the voltages from all lower numbered cells in another embodiment not shown which is a variant of device c the metallicnonmetallic composite cathode is utilized by inserting thin semitransparent metallic layers of eg  ag in  mg or other low work function metals or metal alloys these metallic layers of approximately  å or less in thickness are placed below and adjacent to the metal substitute eg ito layers a b b and c to form a metallicnonmetallic composite cathode for each subunit in another embodiment not shown layers a b c and d are arranged to be on top of layers a b c d so that the subunits have the anode on top and the voltages vli correspondingly have the opposite polarity fig d depicts a series connected device d similar to device c but with the subunits interconnected by charge transfer layers d d and d of eg ito of approximate thickness  å preferably less than  å and most preferably around  å there is yet another embodiment not shown in which the organic semiconducting layers are reversed so that a device with an overall opposite electrical polarity is obtained another embodiment is a variation not shown of device d in which thin semitransparent metallic layers of eg  ag in  mg or other low work function metals or metal alloys layers of approximate thickness  å or less are placed below and adjacent to layers d d and d to form metallicnonmetallic composite charge transfer layers and below and adjacent to layer c to form a metallicnonmetallic composite cathode in fig  an exemplary embodiment  of a stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic device comprised of a number of multilayer organic photovoltaic subcells insulating or conductive substrate  provides support photovoltaic subcell first transparent electrodes a b and c comprise eg ito photosensitive optoelectronic subcell first organic layers a b c and d comprise eg cupc or ptcda or ptcbi photosensitive optoelectronic subcell second organic layers a b c and d comprise eg αnpd photosensitive optoelectronic subcell third organic layers a b c and d comprise eg alq photosensitive optoelectronic subcell fourth organic layers a b c and d comprise eg cupc or ptcda or ptcbi photosensitive optoelectronic subcell second transparent electrodes a and b comprise eg ito dimensions in each subcell of this exemplary embodiment are the same ranges as in the embodiment of fig  but are varied for optimization according to the criteria disclosed elsewhere herein all first transparent electrodes a b and c are electrically connected in parallel and all second transparent electrodes are electrically connected in parallel to provide increased photocurrent here as well the stack could be continued to include an arbitrary number of subcells however stacking beyond a thickness in which substantially all incident light is absorbed will not further increase conversion efficiency just as the order of the inner pairs of the subcell was not critical in the exemplary embodiment of fig  it is not critical here either except that the pair order must alternate between subcells to allow the interior transparent electrodes to act as common contacts for adjacent cells therefore the order of the first inner pair of organic layers will determine the order for the remainder of the stack in this parallel interconnected embodiment a further embodiment of the present invention not shown is a variation of embodiment  and has the subcells separated by transparent insulating layers such as sio of approximate thickness  å preferably less than  å and most preferably around  å with additional transparent electrode layers as required in analogy to the unilayer and bilayer stacked devices described above if the alq and αnpd layers are arranged with the alq on top then the subcells are all oriented with the cathode on top to utilize the low resistance cathode such as disclosed in parthasarathy  with the subcells thus electrically isolated in the stack they may be connected externally in accord with the present invention in either a parallel or series manner as described with the bilayer subcells in other variations of embodiment  the present invention has a stacked configuration wherein the subunits are stacked in series ie with aligned polarity but not separated by insulating layers in one embodiment not shown the multilayer cells are interconnected by electrode layers such that a plurality of voltages are available from a single device similar to embodiment c in another variation not shown the adjacent multilayer subcells are interconnected by charge transfer layers in a manner similar to embodiment d in all of the variations not shown of embodiment  described herein the metallicnonmetallic composite cathode such as disclosed in forrest  may be used in place of the highly transparent low resistance nonmetallic cathode in this case the fourth organic layer of each subcell a b c andor d may be eliminated if desired in yet another embodiment not shown one or both of the outer pair of organic layers in the subcells is replaced with a thin layer approximately  å of mgag alloy which acts as a charge transfer extraction and protective cap layer it should be noted that in all of the stacked devices so far discussed eg unilayer bilayer and multilayer the thicknesses of all the subunits in any given device may be uniform ie substantially the same from one subcell or subunit to the next in particular the thicknesses of the photoconductive organic layers which perform photoconversion are approximately the same in each subunit however since the photosensitive layers absorb electromagnetic radiation the intensity of radiation admitted on one side eg the top of a stacked device decreases as the radiation traverses deeper into the device the voltage generated by each cell or subcell is generally a function of certain intrinsic properties eg the energy level distributions in the respective materials forming the heterojunction and in particular the homolumo gap as previously discussed herein however the current generated in a cell or subcell depends on the amount of electromagnetic radiation which is admitted to the particular cell or subcell in a stacked device composed of multiple subcells of uniform thickness and exposed to ambient electromagnetic radiation from only one direction the current generated by subcells farther from the admission surface or face of the stacked device will decrease in cells progressively farther from the face in stacked devices which are configured to be electrically connected in parallel eg embodiments a and  this would not necessarily be a major drawback since the currents are combined externally to supply a current equal to the sum of that from all subcells with the voltage fixed by the intrinsic uniform voltage of the subcells in such parallel devices the total power output of each subcell may be extracted without any inefficiency due to limitation by a particular subcell in situations where it is desirable to obtain multiple outputs having the same current capacity devices may be constructed as described below on the other hand the different current limitation in each subcell may be an important factor in the operation of series connected stacked devices in a stacked device which is connected in series such as embodiment d fundamental current continuity considerations constrain the devices current output so that it is limited to the current which goes through the subcell generating the least current regardless of the relative position of a subcell in the stack to address this problem other embodiments of the present invention utilize subcells having photoconductive organic layers with thicknesses which vary systematically between subcells for example in a variation of embodiment d the photoconductive organic layers vary in thickness such that each subcell has exponentially thicker photoconductive organic layers if measured starting at the top of the device this last variation of embodiment d would be most appropriate where the source of the electromagnetic radiation is limited to one side of the device here the top ie farthest from the substrate in another variation the photoconductive organic layers may be made exponentially thicker starting from the bottom subcell this embodiment would be appropriate in an environment where the source of electromagnetic radiation is on the substrate side of the device when the substrate is transparent for uniformly illuminated environments where approximately equal intensity electromagnetic radiation light is incident on the two faces of a device yet another variation of embodiment d may be efficient if the electromagnetic radiation has sufficient intensity that a significant amount of the radiation incident upon each face is able to traverse the device then an embodiment variation of d wherein the photoconductive organic layers in the subcells in the center are thicker than corresponding layers in subcells nearer the two faces will provide uniform current levels from each cell the situation with series stacked devices which generate multiple independently accessible voltages eg c is somewhat more complicated in such a device the currents through different subcells in the device may be different since the multiple external connections to the various internal electrodes allow multiple paths for current to flow so the effect of low current production by any particular subcell depends on the load dynamics in other embodiments of the present invention multiple layers of organic photosensitive materials are used to enhance device sensitivity in one embodiment organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices in accord with the present invention incorporate multilayer photoconductor layers to enhance exciton dissociation specifically it is believed that the presence of numerous well defined interfaces between materials provide more extensive exciton dissociation regions the composite layers may have thicknesses commensurate with the device guidelines described above or thinner layers as described next in yet a further embodiment organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices in accord with the present invention incorporate multiple quantum wells mqws mqws are believed to alter the distribution of exciton energy levels resulting in inter alia possible changes in the spectral sensitivity of mqwcontaining devices as compared to devices having the same materials and thicker photosensitive layers that do not exhibit quantum size effects also it is believed that the changes in exciton energy levels may serve to enhance exciton dissociation it is believed that these embodiments having multiple photosensitive layers including mqw structures provide enhanced photosensitivity but may not be appropriate for continuous use since they can quickly saturate due to charge which becomes trapped in the layers therefore in an exemplary use organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices in accord with the present invention and incorporating mqws would be used as intermittent photodetectors with for example a liquid crystal shutter mechanism which would periodically block light for short intervals from the detector so as to allow the trapped charge to dissipate such structures may be operated with a purely passive load as depicted in figs a and b however these multilayer structures are highly efficient when operated with an applied bias under such conditions such a device can produce a large transient current when initially exposed to light arbour et al describes bilayer and multilayer assemblies of vanadyl phathalocyanine vopc and ptcda using semitransparent au or sno thin films as one contact and transparent electrolytes saturated in a redox species for the opposing electrical contact it is appreciated that arbour did not utilize solid state electrode materials suitable for practical devices for both electrical contacts also it is appreciated that arbours multilayer devices did not have intervening electrodes or charge transfer layers as disclosed herein above forrest chem rev  further describes the effect of multiple layers of organic photosensitive materials but does not disclose the use of such layers in devices having two transparent electrodes embodiments with numerous well defined interfaces andor mqws are now described with reference to fig a and fig b fig a schematically depicts a device a with two electrodes a and a which are eg ito of approximate thickness  å preferably less than  å and most preferably around  å for this embodiment the bottom ito electrode preferably functions as the anode and the top electrode functions as the cathode for example the top ito electrode may be sputter deposited onto the underlying organic layer so as to form a low resistance nonmetallic cathode or alternatively the top electrode a may be comprised of a thin mgag layer onto which the ito layer is sputter deposited so as to form a metallicnonmetallic composite cathode the layers a a b c d e f g h i and j and a a b c d e f g h i and j are pairs of organic photoconductive materials which form a plurality of interfaces between each respective a and a pair the layers may be organic molecular crystal semiconducting materials as described elsewhere herein or polymer semiconductors as also described herein for example in one embodiment the pairs may be eg ptcdacupc ptcbicupc or ptcdavopc note also that the layer pairs need not necessarily be of different majority carrier type but may be isotype the important feature of the layer pairs is that they produce numerous interfaces to promote and in some cases alter exciton dissociation dynamics layers of the exemplary materials just mentioned may be in the range of approximately  å with  å being the preferred upper end of the range devices designed specifically to utilize mqw effects will have much thinner layers with thicknesses determined by the approximate spatial dimensions of the primary excitonic modes these considerations are discussed in forrest chem rev  which is incorporated herein by reference for the materials mentioned above ptcdacupc ptcbicupc and ptcdavopc mqw layers should be in the  å range embodiment b in fig b is a variation of a having an additional thin metallic layer b of eg  å of mgag alloy which acts as a charge transfer extraction and protective cap layer and forms a metallicnonmetallic composite electrode with the metal substitute ito layer a it is appreciated that in these devices the photoconductive layer materials may be deposited with either member of the pair on top as long as the layers are alternated throughout the device further it is appreciated that the number of pairs depicted is illustrative only and may be more or fewer depending upon the thicknesses of the photoconductive layers the general constraint again is that the total thickness of all the layers should not generally be greater than the penetration length of the electromagnetic radiation for which the device is to be utilized in yet a further exemplary embodiment a reflective substrate of eg metal or a nonreflective substrate coated with a reflective layer of eg metal such as al or au may be used to support organic photosensitive optoelectronic device structures in accordance with the present invention fig a depicts an example of an embodiment with a reflective surface based on a single bilayer cell a is a substrate which may be transparent eg glass or nontransparent eg a metal thin metal layer a is deposited on the substrate layer a is an optional metal substitute electrode layer for example ito if layer a is not used then layer a functions as an electrode and is of a suitable material as described elsewhere herein first organic layer a is an organic semiconductor for example cupc second organic layer a is a second organic semiconductor for example ptcda or ptcbi the transparent electrode a that is placed on top is preferably a low resistance nonmetallic cathode or a metallicnonmetallic composite cathode fig b shows a stacked bilayer device embodiment with a reflective bottom layer with the subcells connected in parallel b is a substrate which may be transparent eg glass or nontransparent eg a metal if a glass substrate is used thin metal layer b may be deposited on the substrate since a metal substrate or metal layer is present to provide the reflective surface the metal substrate or metal layer also preferably functions as the bottom electrode of the device however if desired an optional transparent electrode layer ba comprised of ito may be present layers b b and c are subcell first electrode layers and may be a metal substitute such as ito a transparent metal or comprise ito over a thin metallic layer such as mg—ag layers b a and b are subcell second electrode layers and may be a metal substitute such as ito a transparent metal or comprise ito over a thin metallic layer such as mg—ag organic layers b a b c and d are a first organic semiconductor eg cupc organic layers b a b c and d are a second organic semiconductor for example ptcda or ptcbi in another embodiment not depicted a transparent substrate is used to support any organic photosensitive optoelectronic device in accord with the present invention in this embodiment the top subcell of the stack has a top reflective layer typically and all intervening subcells have transparent electrodes and light is received through the substrate the top reflective layer can be an electrode or a metallic layer deposited on a transparent nonmetallic electrode in all of these embodiments ie with either a top or a bottom reflecting surface the reflective surface redirects any unabsorbed light back through the absorbing layers to allow further opportunity for photoconversion and enhancement of the quantum efficiency inclusion of a reflective layer reduces the number of subcells required in a stack to obtain optimal photoconversion efficiency in fabricating practical organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices in addition to determining the optimal number of and thickness of layers to have in a stacked photosensitive optoelectronic device as discussed above the area and arrangement of individual cells may be chosen to optimize efficiency and cost since the transparent electrodes that are to be used in these devices do have some residual absorption it is preferable to keep such electrodes thin to minimize this absorption in addition keeping the electrode layers as thin as practicable minimizes fabrication time on the other hand as all electrode materials are made thinner their sheet resistance increases therefore it is preferable to minimize the distance which charge carriers must travel in the electrode after collection a configuration which maximizes photosensitive optoelectronic receptive area and accomplishes this goal is one in which the devices are laid out in long strips on the substrate with electrical connection made to the devices electrodes along the longer sides us patent application ser no  to forrest et al now us pat no  hereinafter forrest  which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety describes techniques for fabrication of practical organic thin film devices parthasarathy  disclosed that small molecular organic materials with relatively large planar molecules and a highly conjugated structure such as cupc and ptcda are believed to be able to withstand energetic electrode deposition because of the highly delocalized nature of their bonding which spreads the energy of impact over more than one bond when an energetic metal or oxygen atom is incident on one of these molecules at a surface during sputtering the energy of impact is thought to be efficiently distributed over the numerous bonds in the molecular πelectron systems in contrast no comparably large πelectron systems exist in eg alq or αnpd for such molecules the impact energy is more localized among only a few atomic sites thereby increasing the probability for breaking a molecular bond the planar or nearly planar stacking arrangements of crystalline molecular systems such as cupc and ptcda may also assist in the dissipation of energy among several neighboring molecules in the lattice accordingly it is believed that the low resistance nonmetallic cathode such as disclosed in parthasarathy  can also be embodied in other similar types of small molecular crystals for example cupc may be replaced by other metal phthalocyanines naphthalocyanines and porphyrins ptcda may be replaced for example by other polyacenes some other representative photosensitive optoelectronic small molecule organic heterostructure combinations contemplated as suitable for use in accord with the present invention are shown

polyacrylonitrile pan polyheptadiyne phd polymethylacetylene pma polyphenylene vinylene pppv polyphenylene oxide pppo these materials may be incorporated in any of the several stacked photocell embodiments disclosed above also it is believed that polymers that have a highly connected structure can form the low resistance nonmetallic cathode by receiving an energetically deposited metal substitute cathode such as sputtered ito when such an electrodesemiconductor interface would otherwise form a substantial barrier to carrier flow also it will be appreciated that the novel concept of electrically connecting organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices in parallel to overcome the inefficiencies associated with their high series resistance and related space charge effects is equally applicable to other organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices comprising other subcell compositions similarly the novel concept of connecting stacked organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices in series with external connections to intervening electrodes to provide a multivoltage power supply is applicable to other organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices also use of the low resistance nonmetallic cathode disclosed in parthasarathy  in place of a traditional semitransparent metallic cathode such as disclosed in prior art organic photosensitive optoelectronic material configurations is intended to be within the scope of the present invention general techniques for fabrication of devices in accord with the present invention are wellknown in the art the preferred method of depositing the organic layers is by thermal evaporation the preferred method of depositing metal layers is by thermal or electronbeam evaporation the preferred method of depositing dielectrics is by plasmaenhanced chemical vaporization rf or rfdc sputtering or electronbeam evaporation the fabrication of the organic photosensitive optoelectronic devices may be accomplished for example with either a shadow masking technique or shadow masking combined with a dry etching process for preforming the substrate shadow masking and dry etching are known in the art advanced photolithographic deposition techniques for production of the various embodiments of the present invention have been previously disclosed in relation to the fabrication of organic thin films in forrest  for example one of ordinary skill in the art can construct the device embodiment as depicted in fig  using the techniques described in forrest  and incorporated herein with the further benefit of this disclosure fig  depicts an implementation of a stacked photosensitive optoelectronic device having three subcells with subcells connected electronically in parallel embodiment  is depicted within the “shadow box” after the step of encapsulation as described in forrest   is a continuous region of a transparent conductive material eg ito which forms a bottom electrode and one electrode in the middle of the stack layer  is a plurality of photoconductive organic layers depicted as one here for convenience which form a rectifying junction in accord with the present invention  is another continuous region of transparent conductive material eg ito which forms a top electrode and one electrode in the middle of the stacked device layers  and  are similarly pluralities of photoconductive organic layers it is appreciated that in this embodiment there are three subcells which are deposited so as to have alternating polarity ie the top and bottom subcells have the same polarity and the middle subcell has the opposite polarity it is appreciated in embodiment  that the photoconductive organic layers   and  are intended to be continuously connected the organic materials contemplated for use in this particular embodiment are sufficiently poor conductors that they can effectively insulate the transparent conductive regions  and  from each other as depicted and still perform the photoconductive functions described elsewhere herein protective layer  should be made of a nonconductive material for example the protective layer could be spin coated polymer such as teflon™ or sputter deposited sio or sin protective layer  should also be transparent when electromagnetic radiation is to be admitted through the top of the device in another optional embodiment not illustrated protective layer  may be omitted but the top electrode layers must be made thick as to be impervious to ambient atmosphere to protect the organic materials comprising the device from performance degrading chemical reactions using the “shadow box” technique a stacked bilayer organic photosensitive optoelectronic device similar to fig  can be made in the following steps  depositing a transparent  μm dielectric layer onto a substrate with prepatterned contacts the dielectric layer can be sio for example  depositing a photoresist layer  exposing the photoresist layer to light in a pattern for device bottom layers  removing unexposed photoresist areas to leave a pattern of photoresist over the dielectric layer  remove the dielectric layer by eg chloride reactiveion
