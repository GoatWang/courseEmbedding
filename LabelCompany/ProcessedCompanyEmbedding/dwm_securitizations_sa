entails a high degree of risk since the investment vehicles may not achieve their investment objectives and an investor could suffer a substantial or full loss of his or her investment the following section describes the principal types of assets managed by dwm on behalf of clients  microfinance and related assets in the form of debt or equity investments in microfinance and related financial institutions including banks that focus on fields related to microfinance such as sme lending lowincome housing education financing water procurement and sanitation microinsurance housing loans for the poor and remittances and  bonds or other similar debt securities issued primarily by development finance institutions whose focus is economic development in the developing world microfinance and related investments the funds invest debt and equity in microfinance institutions and related financial institutions including banks that focus on fields related to microfinance such as sme lending lowincome housing education financing water procurement and sanitation microinsurance housing loans for the poor and remittances  mfis and each an mfi  mfi debt assets typically take the form of senior unsecured loans but may also include senior secured loans and subordinated loans  as well as structured holdings representing mfi debt assets debt exposures range from shortto longterm maturities mfi equity assets typically are unlisted private equity shares as well as warrants or other call options on the equity of mfis convertible instruments and structured holdings representing mfi equity or profit participation notes in selecting suitable mfi investments dwm employs a researchintensive bottomup approach each investment is selected for inclusion in a fund only after substantial due diligence has been performed by dwm and after review and approval by the investment committee of the relevant fund mfis are selected by dwm from central america south america eastern europe the caucasus  central asia the middle east  africa and south  southeast asia or from other developing world areas that meet sufficiently robust financial and institutional criteria as to be suitable for investment by dwm s clients additionally dwm and its clients may have socialimpact goals that are taken into consideration during the investment process eg raising income levels for microentrepreneurs as well as owners and employees of small or medium enterprises currently in poverty increasing the size of the ability of mfis to finance microentrepreneurs and small or medium enterprises opening a sizable funding supply to help meet growing demand from mfis etc mfi debt investments origination dwm uses a wide variety of contacts relationships and financial engineering techniques to originate potential mfi debt assets using any combination of these techniques dwm examines a broad selection of mfis and identifies those that dwm believes are most likely to meet the standards required for selection as microfinance assets for its funds dwm then contacts those mfis that look promising and invites them to proceed to an initial negotiation and deeper screening process screening potential mfi debt investments are first screened via desk top analysis of the company s business model financial performance and business plan resulting in an initial assessment of the expected return on investment following agreement to a preliminary term sheet dwm s debt team presents promising deals to the investment committees for discussion and feedback due diligence dwm seeks to substantiate its knowledge of the mfi candidates by conducting due diligence this process involves the submission by each mfi of detailed financial and other information as well as meetings or other discussions with the mfi management to assess their competence this is both a backwardlooking and forwardlooking process involving reviews of past performance and future business plans and projections in nearly all cases dwm will have visited the head office of the mfi and met the management of the mfi prior to submitting the potential investment to the relevant investment committees evaluation dwm employs a proprietary scoring system that evaluates each mfi that is a candidate for debt financing based on a number of quantitative and qualitative criteria the scoring process is based upon the mfis financials and track record as well as subjective  judgments of management and other intangible factors the following criteria are used in evaluating mfis for potential debt investment by any fund financial strength financially strong as measured by the quality of the mfi s portfolio its operating costs and its overall profitability social impact evidence of demonstrable social impact through the mfi serving large numbers of poor clients long term competitiveness a clear and compelling strategy for achieving or maintaining longterm sustainability management values commitment to financial sustainability transparency of information and the evaluation of both financial and social impact based on results investment approval after dwm s relationship managers have completed the evaluation process described above recommendations and supporting memos are submitted to dwm s internal review process the first level of internal review for each potential mfi debt investment is by dwm s chief credit officer the chief credit officer evaluates the mfi and the loan conditions from a credit and risk standpoint and if approved it is then forwarded to the internal dwm credit committee which consists of the four partners of dwm plus the chief credit officer the investment proposal is evaluated on the credit committee level and either approved rejected entirely or sent back for more due diligence debt investments that are approved by the internal dwm credit committee are submitted by dwm to the investment committee of the relevant funds eligible to invest for consideration the approval of a fund s investment committee is required for the fund to make the investment mfi equity investments origination dwm originates mfi equity transactions via a variety of sources including its existing debt relationships partners contacts with mfi managers and stakeholders as well as industry conferences and brokers screening potential deals are first screened via desk top analysis of the company s business model financial performance and business plan resulting in an initial assessment of the expected return on investment following agreement to a preliminary term sheet the equity team presents promising mfi equity investments to the investment committees of the relevant funds for discussion and feedback due diligence on site due diligence is required for final presentation to and approval from the relevant investment committees over   days dwm employees conduct meetings with senior and middle management visit branches and borrowers and in some cases meet with competitors and regulators evaluation based on the results of its due diligence the equity team builds a complete financial model that is accompanied by a detailed investment report describing the proposed mfi equity asset in its evaluation of each individual mfi dwm focuses especially on the quality of  management reputation track record and performance dwm employs rigorous risk analysis methodologies for mfi based on thorough evaluation of risk and performance dimensions risk analysis includes country and industry analysis as well as indepth specific risk assessment focusing on governance finance and operations performance dimensions cover the double bottom line of each microfinance or related lending program its social performance and its financial performance throughout the process the following criteria are used in evaluating the microfinance institution or microfinance related assets for investment financial strength dwm desires to invest only in mfis that are financially strong as measured by the quality of their portfolio their operating costs and their overall profitability social impact dwm desires to invest in mfis that show evidence of demonstrable social impact through serving large numbers of poor clients long term competitiveness dwm desires to invest in mfis with a clear and compelling strategy for achieving or maintaining longterm sustainability management values dwm desires to invest in mfis committed to financial sustainability transparency of information and the evaluation of both financial and social impact based on results prospects for growth although this criterion is in many respects a derivative of the above four criteria it is a key focus of the investment analysis performed by dwm investment approval once the evaluation process above is completed the recommendation of the equity team and the supporting memorandum for each proposed equity investment is submitted for internal approval all prospective equity investments must be approved by the internal dwm equity investment committee which consists of all four partners of dwm before being recommended to the investment committee of the relevant funds eligible to invest for consideration the approval of a fund s investment committee is required for the fund to make the investment bonds on march   dwm launched a new fund the dwm microfinance fund j the fund provides the underlying investments for a mutual fund in japan which is the sole investor to date in the fund in order to provide liquidity to investors dwm targets investing the majority of the fund s assets in bonds as described further below sovereign debt and other similar marketable debt instruments the fund is primarily invested in bonds issued by multilateral development finance institutions and development finance institutions that focus on economic development in the developing world  dfi bonds  the fund also has the ability to invest in bonds issued by microfinance institutions the fund will invest in shortterm sovereign debt to provide liquidity for redemptions funding of mfi loans and semiannual dividend payments dwm aims to maintain a diversified portfolio of dfi bonds targeting a range of issuers tenors emerging market currencies and geographies dwm selects the dfi bonds that meet the objectives of the fund in particular capital preservation interest income in currencies which offer higher interest rates than offered on japanese yen denominated instruments and substantial liquidity  the dwm microfinance fund j intends to maintain full exposure to emerging market currencies and does not intend to hedge currency or interest rate exposure dwm has invested the fund primarily in dfi bonds denominated in emerging market currencies and as the fund makes loans to mfis the bonds will mature or be sold to fund the loans as the bonds are public issues of multilateral institutions established by treaty or governmental entities there is no extensive due diligence performed other than due attention to the role such instruments are intended to play in accomplishing the investment objectives each issuer of dfi bonds will be submitted to the fund s investment committee for approval while dwm will retain overall responsibility for selection of such individual assets within the parameters of the fund s investment guidelines there is no limit on the allocation to dfi bonds or dfis rated aaa the majority of the dfi bonds are rated aaa but dfis or dfi bonds rated below aaa can be included in the bond portfolio and the majority of the dfi bonds by volume are issued by development finance institutions which are multilateral institutions while up to  of dfi bonds may be denominated in currencies of developing countries the majority of dfi bond exposures by volume are to instruments denominated in investment grade currencies of developing countries dfi bonds issued in noninvestment grade currencies together with microfinance loans extended in such currencies may constitute no more than  of the total net assets of the fund the maximum percentage of the portfolio allocated to dfi bonds rated lower than aaa that are not issued by multilateral institutions is  material risks investment in any of dwm s investment vehicles is speculative and entails a high degree of risk since the investment vehicles may not achieve their investment objectives and an investor could suffer a substantial or full loss of his or her investment some of the material risks for investments in the investment vehicles are set out below  most of the mfi debt and equity assets are invested in mfis that are small and recently formed relative to many small and mediumsized nonprofit and forprofit entities in europe united states and other countries with developed economies many have not previously received external financing from traditional commercial sources and may not qualify for such financing under traditional bases of evaluation many of these mfis have not been rated by traditional rating agencies or similar commercial institutions  changes in the economic or political conditions of a country in which an mfi operates or changes in the financial condition of any given mfi could have a material negative impact on the ability of the relevant investment vehicle to receive on a timely basis payments due in respect of any given investment and may impair the ability of the mfis to make analyze supervise record or collect on microloans or similar assets to function successfully in the other businesses they operate or to service their obligations further the countries in which the mfis are located are all relatively less well equipped to deal with natural disasters or major upheavals such as floods hurricanes earthquakes war terrorism or riots than are the united states and other economically developed countries and may not efficiently and quickly recover from such disaster events if any investment vehicle s receipt on a timely basis of payments from any mfi is interrupted then such  fund may be unable to make payments and such investment vehicle s net asset value could decline  although dwm has been involved in the initiation development and fund management of several mfirelated investment vehicles each new fund or structured investment managed by dwm is a new enterprise that lacks both operating and financial experience  investors in any of the dwm funds may be paid dividends and may be able to redeem their units in a dwm fund only to the extent that the assets in such funds are serviced and repaid or can be sold for value  mfi debt assets may be senior or subordinated may not be ranked equally in right of payment with all other unsecured debt of the mfis and will in most cases not be backed by any collateral liens on assets or other guarantees or security furthermore mfis typically either do not require collateral security from their clients the microborrowers or if they do have collateral security from the microborrowers they may not have a perfected security interest in such collateral  the mfi equity assets have no right of repayment and the ability to realize a return or even simply to return capital to investors will be entirely dependent upon the success of a fund in finding an opportunity to exit primarily through a secondary sale or an initial public offering the market for such exit opportunities is not welldeveloped and only a few mfis have gone public in the history of microfinance  if the dwm microfinance fund is unable to meet its limited offer of liquidity the investors in this fund may have no choice but to maintain their investment for many years the dwm microfinance fund has no wind up date and dwm intends to operate the dwm microfinance fund indefinitely  there is no public market for the units in the dwm microfinance equity fund i and there likely will be no trading market for them in the future accordingly investors will have difficulty selling or otherwise disposing of their units  the dwm microfinance fund j offers redemptions on a limited basis based on these redemption procedures there is no assurance that the value of the funds will be the same as at the time that notice was first given or that the investment will be profitable investors bear the risk of a downturn in the markets or of a decline in the value of their investment without the ability to redeem their funds  risks associated with the bond portfolio of the dwm microfinance fund j include but are not limited to exchange rate risk interest rate risk price risk and liquidity risk in particular the fund s investment strategy is to gain exposure to foreign currencies particularly in the emerging markets accordingly dwm may but ordinarily does not intend to hedge currency exposure the creditworthiness of the development finance institutions issuing the bonds are subject to among other things adverse changes in the financial condition of such development finance institutions clients which may arise from  factors specific to a particular industry or from changes in the macroeconomic environment or the financial markets in the countries in which the clients of the development finance institutions operate  there can be no assurance of a secondary market for bonds in the bond portfolio of the dwm microfinance fund j or the liquidity of such a market where it exists consequently dwm may not be able to sell the dfi bonds readily or at prices that will enable them to realize a yield comparable to that of similar instruments if any with a developed secondary market  the interests of dwm and its affiliates may conflict in various ways with the interests of the investors in any of the investment vehicles dwm and its related entities may engage in fund management financing advisory lending financing or other businesses with or affecting the mfis in which a particular investment vehicle invests and which may compete with the investment vehicles in which a particular investment vehicle invests or may have other business with the mfis unrelated to the investment such activities could even take place simultaneously with the origination of a particular mfi debt or equity asset for a particular investment vehicle  the financial and other information of the potential mfis upon which dwm will rely in part in selecting and monitoring the mfis will be provided primarily by the mfis themselves and may not have been audited or prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards  ifrs  or united states generally accepted accounting principles  us gaap  as many of the mfis are small unregulated enterprises with limited access to sources of funding and service a very impoverished clientele furthermore standards of disclosure in certain economically developing countries where mfis are located may be materially less stringent than those of the united states in addition ifrs which the general partner anticipates will be used to audit most or all mfis differ in certain material respects from us gaap the results of an audit of an mfi conducted pursuant to ifrs may differ materially from an audit performed on the microfinance institution conducted pursuant to us gaap  mfi debt assets will be denominated in local currencies us dollars or euro and the mfis will principally make microloans that are denominated in their local currencies if during the term of an mfi debt asset the value of such local currency falls relative to the currency in which the company has made the loan for the relevant fund the mfi may have difficulty repaying such mfi debt asset in addition local governments may impose foreign exchange controls on or block entirely transactions to convert local currency to foreign currency including the us dollars and euro such restrictions could impede the ability of mfis to repay an mfi asset in any currency  all investment vehicles are denominated in one or more of the following currencies us dollars euros japanese yen andor pounds sterling the assets and liabilities denominated in each of these currencies may not be matched and could expose the relevant investment vehicle to a material risk of adverse currency movements apart from  staying within fund diversification limits there may be no attempt to hedge this currency risk in any of the investment vehicles going forward  dwm may engage in cross currency or interest rate swaps with international banks or other counterparties to reduce currency or interest rate risks however there is no assurance that the swap counterparty will not default on or otherwise fail to make the payment obligations to dwm or the relevant investment vehicle in addition if the investment vehicle fails to make scheduled payments to the swap counterparty the counterparty can omit corresponding payments due to the investment vehicle can terminate the swap and can add payment obligations due to it from the relevant investment vehicle to compensate the counterparty for losses due to the cancellation of the contract or otherwise stemming from the failure of the investment vehicle to make scheduled payments  an investment vehicle may attempt to reduce repayment risk to the overall mfi asset portfolio by agreeing to fund certain mfi assets indirectly by means of a deposit in us dollars euros japanese yen andor pounds sterling placed with an international bank which in turn issues a standby letter of credit to a local bank in the country in which an mfi is based for the purpose of helping secure a local currency loan to the mfi by the local bank however there can be no assurance that the international bank will not fail causing a loss to the relevant investment vehicle of its deposit there can be no reliance on deposit insurance provided by the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  or any analogous institution in another country for any amount of the deposit which exceeds the applicable insured deposit limit in such country there also can be no assurance that the international bank will perform correctly in its administration of the standby letter of credit following a drawing under the stand by letter of credit it is unlikely that the mfi will meet its reimbursement obligations to the relevant investment vehicle or it may not be permitted by governmental authorities or policies to do so  an investment vehicle may purchase existing mfi assets from a third party there is a risk that the authorities in the country in which the mfi is based or in the country where the third party is based will impose tax or penalties which might or might not have been due had the mfi asset been issued directly to the investment vehicle purchasing such asset or that the mfi asset may not be successfully conveyed and that disputes could arise as to the ownership of the mfi asset or as to the obligation of the mfi to repay such a loan  an investment vehicle may purchase participations in mfi assets from a third party in such circumstances such investment vehicle may not have direct contractual relationship with the mfi and may only enforce its right against the third party further the presence of the third party as the intermediary with the mfi leads inevitably to the assumption of credit risk and performance risk on the third party relating to its ability and willingness to collect and make payments to such investment vehicle to enforce such investment vehicle s rights and to ensure that such investment vehicle may successfully collect its investment   an investment vehicle s mfi assets may not comprise the majority or a substantial amount by aggregate value of such mfi s outstanding shortterm or longterm indebtedness consequently dwm may have limited leverage over any mfi to enforce the repayment and other terms of the mfis obligations to the relevant investment vehicles in the event of the failure of an mfi to make principal and interest payments on the mfi assets to any investment vehicle  dwm may have more difficulty establishing and securing legal rights in respect of the mfi debt or equity assets on behalf of the investment vehicles in the countries in which the mfis operate than it would establishing and securing the rights in the united states western europe japan or other more developed countries accordingly dwm s recourse to legal and regulatory proceedings in such foreign countries to establish or secure dwm s rights in respect of one or more mfi debt or equity assets may be limited or nonexistent in addition in connection with the making of the mfi debt or equity assets dwm s investment vehicles may be subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in one or more such foreign countries  dwm may engage third parties to assist or entirely provide the evaluation due diligence negotiation and ongoing monitoring of certain investments to be made for an investment vehicle there is an inherent risk that the thirdparty may not provide the same quality of advice as dwm  dwm seeks to place all of the funds subscribed by investors in the investment vehicles there is a substantial likelihood however that a portion of funds to be invested in mfi debt or equity assets will remain uninvested for a meaningful period the outstanding funds will be invested in cash and will earn a correspondingly lower return than the return due on such funds in certain investment vehicles at dwm s sole discretion such cash might be invested with mfis as deposits or other short term instruments in local currencies  if withholding or deduction of any taxes from payments of principal interest or capital gains in respect of the mfi debt or equity assets is required by law in any jurisdiction the mfi may not be under any obligation to make any additional payments to any investors in respect of such withholding or deduction each investor assumes and is solely responsible for all taxes of any jurisdiction or governmental or regulatory authority including without limitation any state or local taxes or other like assessments or charges that may be applicable to any payment to it in respect of its investment in any investment vehicle other sources of information dwm includes in its due diligence and collection of information of potential portfolio companies discussions with senior management regular monitoring of financial statements and other financial metrics and onsite visits of potential portfolio companies such onsite visits occur during the initial stage of the investment process and annually after investment in the portfolio company during onsite visits dwm interviews management of the portfolio companies to assess their competence and collects financial
