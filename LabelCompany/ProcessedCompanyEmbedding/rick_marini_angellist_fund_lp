established angels the infrastructure and capital to make larger investments in startups without the fulltime hassle of running a dedicated fundrick marini is one of the first angels to run an angel fund a serial entrepreneur tickle branchout talkco investor in over fifty startups and lp in a handful of traditional vc funds rick shares insights on his trajectory from operator to fund managerthe value he adds as a former entrepreneur and not his ticket size has gotten him into oversubscribed dealsbacking great people is more important than backing great ideas and getting his investments to a series a is more important than hunting for unicornsangel funds are helping rick cut bigger checks and secure pro rata rightsjulie ruvolo you’re the definition of an operatorangel over the last  years you founded and sold three consumer tech companies and invested in another fifty companies how do these pieces fit together for yourick marini there are huge advantages to being a former entrepreneur when you’re helping earlystage companies i focus my investments in consumer tech which gives me two advantages i can assess the companies better because i worked in that space for a number of years and i can be helpful to the founders because i’ve been in their shoesas an angel investor my individual dollar contribution is not going to be a significant percentage of the total round but my help as a former entrepreneur can add a lot of value and that has helped me get into several oversubscribed dealsin that context what is your approach is to helping founderswhat i often tell founders as they’re bringing a round together is to get a lead anchor to take at least half the round it will save you a ton of time herding cats with k checksthen bring in some great valueadd investors as angels try to bring in people with different skill sets such as a growth expert a product person someone who is great at marketing or design or sales bring together angels who have complimentary areas of expertise that can be tapped by the companyone of my important valueads as an angel is guidance in fundraising for example i invested in rinse’s series a out of my first angel fund when they were ready to raise their series b i helped them connect with the right partners at the right firms for them and provided warm introductionsyou’ve launched and sold three startups how soon should a founder start thinking about paths to exita founder should not start a company because they’re looking for a big exit that’s important to understand they should start a company to fundamentally improve a situation that affects many peopleas an investor i have to determine if the company’s solution actually addresses a big need in the market and if this is the right team to execute and if “yes” to both of those then i expect that the upside in the investment will likely be therebut if i pick the wrong team the roi on my investment could be super low when you’re coming in as a disruptor often – of the total value created by this disruption accrues to the  player the next – goes to  and the long tail shares the last  or soso even if i pick the right sector if i pick the  team it’s pretty much a worthless investment even if i pick  and they get – of the market it may not be a great investment unless we’re talking about a big tamtake uber and lyft as an example uber is worth roughly b and lyft is worth basically th of that around –b if you’re an early investor in lyft you’re still really happy but this is also one of the biggest disruptions that we’ve seen in the last  years so it’s kind of the best case scenario for a  player the roi on an early investment uber is much better on paperdid you invest in uber or lyftno but i will tell you a quick story about uber i was at a dinner party right before uber launched and travis was pitching his idea the original vision was focused on black cars ondemand which i thought it was way too niche so i didn’t pursue itit turns out that lyft may have had the bigger idea of normal cars for normal people and then uber quickly followed suit with uberx and that became the big revenue driver for uber not the black carsi may have been right on my assessment of the original business model but i was wrong on the entrepreneur i had known travis for years and i should’ve just said “this guy is a badass he’s gonna figure it out”that situation with travis taught me how important it is to back great people over interesting ideas great people plus innovative ideas can create huge outcomes if you invest in the right team they can pivot into something that is a winner but you cannot back a subpar team because they will lose either they pick the wrong market and lose quickly or they pick the right market and have a false positive of good early results until a better team comes in and takes the marketso you’re thinking about the team and market opportunity more than the exit horizon when you investi do think about the exit but i’m not necessarily thinking about the probability that the company becomes a unicorn or public company and i’ll tell you whyone of the things that i have to consider as a seed investor is what happens when a series a investor looks at this company let’s say i’m investing in a company that is raising a m seed round at an mpre so a mpost and let’s say this company can absolutely see a path to selling to facebook or microsoft or google for m boom i x’d my money… rightwell here’s the reality the typical series a partner at a firm will see more than  companies per year but will only invest in about two when they view a company as an m exit they simply can’t make the investment when there are  other investments with potentially higher exitsso what i thought would be a m exit now won’t get a series a investment they might have proven something in the market but they are running out of cash if they try to do an acquihire the acquiring company does not care about the investors they only care about setting money aside to retain the team they’re acquiring so in the best case i get my money back but more likely i get pennies on the dollar an investment that i thought was going to be x is now worth  of my original investment ouchdid you ever consider working at a traditional vc firm you’re an lp in a few funds — accel partners binary capital velos partners govtech fund and maven ventures — but you’ve invested independently to datei’ve been an entrepreneur for the past  years and i really enjoy being an operator but i also love supporting other entrepreneurs and applying that experience to help them angel investing allows me to do both of these thingsi’ve spent most of the past ten years as an independent angel but in  when naval ravikant told me about angellist i knew i wanted to be part of it as both an investor in angellist and an investor using their platformso i invested in angellist and then in november  i did my first syndicated deal on angellist for a seed investment in luxe valet this was the first time that i had outside capital as part of my investmentwhen luxe was ready for the series a i introduced them to redpoint which was one of my investors in branchout and when they were ready for their series b i introduced them to a friend of mine at venrock since then luxe has gone on to raise m from redpoint and venrock and hertz i continued to invest in every subsequent round with my angellist syndicatedo you do all your deals on angellist how is angellist is situated in your broader investment activityfrom  to  i was doing direct investments personally plus some investments through my angellist syndicate then in  csc set up a dedicated fund to invest alongside angellist investors naval ravikant and i launched the first two closed funds which are now called angel fundswhen you run an angel fund all personal angel investments go through the fund to avoid cherrypicking the next big winner outside of the fund i’ve invested my own money into the fund so for every deal i do it includes my own cash plus my carrywho invested in your angel fundfund  was about k and fund  is a similar size csc backed about half of fund  and the other k came from members of my angellist syndicate but this is not a syndicate this is a closed fund which means that instead of investing with me dealbydeal these people had to commit money upfront with the expectation i’m going to continue to stay in my sandbox in consumer tech investing in earlystage companies started by great entrepreneurs and backed by excellent coinvestorswith access to a committed pool of capital instead of raising dealbydeal what changes for you as an investor if anythingone advantage is that i know the money’s already there and i have totally clarity around how much i’m going to invest whereas with my syndicate i don’t know how much i am actually going to invest i can ask the entrepreneur for a k allocation but my syndicate may only raise k or it may be oversubscribed for k that’s been the hardest part of syndicatesthe upside of a syndicate is that you have the spv structure which means that as soon as there’s an exit you get paid with my angel fund it’s very much like a venture fund which means i need to return all of the lps’ capital before the carry kicks in and the bigger the fund the longer it could take to return the original capitalso for me if i look at the two options i like the closed fund better because the clarity and confidence i have in knowing exactly how much i can commit is worth a lot to me despite the longer timeline for distributionsyou’ve been basically doing angel funds before the angel funds were officially announced very coolnow i’m on fund  each fund is about k and has a year time horizon so i’m doing a deal about every six weeks or so and i’m writing bigger checks — k instead of kand that larger amount of k may get me pro rata rights which is a really important advantage i mentioned rinse that larger check size through my first angel fund allowed me to get pro rata rights to do the series b which i did through fund can you take more risks with a dedicated fund than going to your investors each time you have a deal you want to doit’s been a wonderful transition from doing  personal investments to investing through a fund i still treat it like it’s my money my investing strategy is the samewhen i first started angel investing eight years ago i talked to naval about this and he said “it’s going to take you probably – investments before you really know what you’re doing” and he was right it took me that long before i could gain the pattern recognition over the past  years i made around  angel investments at roughly k each resulting in a very expensive selfpaid education that’s a lot of capital at risk in an illiquid asset class with a long time horizon i’m excited about my portfolio but aspiring angels should understand what the financial commitment looks likewhat’s it’s been like working with the angellist team on your dealshaving the closed fund works well for me because of people like jake zeller and his team at angellist they handle all the backend administration that an operating partner at a venture fund would do for that work and use of the platform angellist take  points of the  points of carry so  of the carry goes to angellist and they handle all of the fund administration wire transfers legal docs tax reporting etc that frees me up to do the two things i like to do to be an operator and to find great companies and invest in them and to me that is worth itlooking ahead as the investment tools at your disposal are evolving where do you see yourself headedmore of the same keep finding great entrepreneurs that are changing the worldoriginally published at blogangelco on
