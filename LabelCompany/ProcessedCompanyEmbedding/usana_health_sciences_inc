tran biosci integrated biosci research consultantmarketplaceintegrated biosci investingsummaryfounded by a worldclass scientist while marketing its products via olympians dr oz and strong sales associates usana created the entrenched moats of brand recognition and product awarenesswith increasing expansion into the vast asian markets the firm is well positioned for continuing sales growthas the world population is aging there is an increasing demand for personal wellness products to service degenerative diseasesdespite operating a highly profitable business the company is on sales as indicated by the mouthwatering pe of  background according to research at the national institute of health global life expectancy is projected to increase by almost eight years from  years in  to  years in  moreover the number of people aged  and older in some asian and latin america countries are expected to increase as much as four fold by the same year with the aging world population comes the rising demand for personal wellness products aka herbaldietary supplements to service the degenerative diseases like osteoarthritis or the usual wear and tear that come with aging that being said usana health sciences nyseusna a firm based in salt lake city utah is poised to capture this niche of growing demand source google finance and with the recent completion of its china manufacturing facility usana is gearing up for continuing its explosive growth in the asiapacific regions of note the asian demographics tend to consume more herbal supplements than elsewhere in the world due to their cultural receptiveness toward complementary and alternative medicine as a result the oriental environment created the highly favorable market and reinforced the entrenched moat for usanas business operations low costsless regulatory oversees in contrast to a developmentalstage biopharma that usually incurs approximately b to innovate a therapeutic from bench research to commercialization in a decadelong process firms selling supplements like usana have key advantages notably there are no strict regulatory hurdles that can hamper corporate growth hence the company is not required to run its products through the timeconsuming and costburdening process of clinical studies that are requisites for a biotech firm aside from the minor manufacturing and other quality measures usana has very few regulatory constraints accordingly the firm can rapidly launch its products with just the following compliance label these statements have not been evaluated by the food and drug administration this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease source usana about the company thriving in a less stringent overseeing environment usana differentiates itself from competitors due to its sound business model founded in  by myron wentz phd the company develops and manufactures highquality sciencebased nutritional and personal care products with the goal of promoting longterm health and reducing the risks of chronic degenerative diseases operating in  markets worldwide the firm delivers its products through the direct selling to preferred customers as well as the sales distribution to associates as of dec   there are  active associates and  preferred customers worldwide capturing the strategic market as alluded the asian markets have extensive sales growth opportunity and usana has been campaigning to capture an increasing presence in this niche as the fruits of its labor are realized the company generated more than  of the total sales in asiapacific in  it is worthwhile to reiterate that as part of asiapacific the chinese market has a vast number of highly receptive customers and the recent completion of its manufacturing facility in china well positioned the firm for continued sales growth source dr tran biosci advisory for the period ending on dec   usana reported a  increase and a  decrease in sales associates for asia pacific and americaseurope respectively for the same period active preferred customers in the former region increased by  while those in the latter area were only  higher with more sales associates and preferred customers this translates into higher sales  and  for asia pacific and americaseurope correspondingly stellar brand recognitionproduct awareness geography aside the other growth catalyst for usana resides in its stellar research and development as well as its strong relationship with key scientists and research institutions and by utilizing inhouse manufacturing the company ensures that only top quality products are being produced of noteworthy quality is the key driver for continued brand awareness and sales growth interestingly usana employs olympic athletes for products promotion which greatly fosters brand awareness and adoption perhaps one of the greatest recipes for the firms marketing success is its strategic sponsorship of dr ozs show with appropriate incentives the flamboyant md has been aggressively campaigning for usana products any fan of mehmet oz can attest to his prodigious salesmanship if he promotes a new product sales volumes will be catapulted to a record high source usana healthy financials similar to the strength of its business moat the companys financial metrics are also quite impressive for fiscal  the firm generated one billion dollars in revenues more than  of which came from asia pacific as alluded to during the same period the company spent m and procured m in net earnings cash and equivalents also strengthened from m in  to m in the subsequent year furthermore total debts remain nearly constant at m as usana is generating the ample cash cushion it is not surprising that the shares outstanding remain roughly constant at m counts for the past five years there is also no need for dilutive financing when revenues and working capital are growing aggressively while operational spending remains modest source dr tran biosci advisory taken as a whole the overall trends in revenues net earnings working capital cash and shares outstanding as indicated in the figure above are all highly favorable those financial metrics signify that the company is healthy and growing aggressively worldclass management chairman and independent director myron w wentz phd commenced his career as a microbiologist and immunologist in  he founded gull laboratories three years later several of his diagnostic viral assays were fda approved nearly three decades after his initial venture the enterprising scientist sold his business to start usana health sciences furthermore wentzs achievement spans beyond the dietary supplements and viral assays he started sanoviv medical institute a holistic medical facility with full hospital accreditation located in baja california as a philanthropist the chief also founded two medical centerslaboratories in uganda and cambodia to alleviate the suffering of children afflicted by infectious diseases market outperformance the stated cumulative results of strong moats solid business foundation stellar management and continued growth have been handsomely rewarding shareholders for half a decade usana has outperformed competitors as well as the market benchmark sp  by as much as  and  in share price appreciation respectively source usana  annual report potential risks according to the world renowned investor peter lynch investing is both an art and a science therefore no precision and accuracy can be guaranteed that being said despite promising prospects investors should be aware of the baseline investing risks in usana since china generated the most sales certain regulatory changes relating to the direct selling and multilevel marketing can adversely affect operational outcomes furthermore there are strong competitive pressures from nu skin enterprises nysenus amway international and herbalife nysehlf needless to say we expect usanas entrenched moat to help the firm in maintaining its competitiveness for years to come conclusion as the leader in the highly profitable personal wellness products market that has a strong moat usana is still in its aggressive growth phase started by a worldclass scientist the company marketed its products via elite athletes and stellar salesmanship as well as the low cost and strong reputation of its sales associates it is important for readers to be cognizant that a supplements business thrives on stellar marketing and usana is employing marketing approaches that are second to none additionally the nature of the supplements business enabled it to bypass the high regulatory hurdles inherent to the biopharmaceuticals industry as a result this enabled the firm to promptly launch new products while incurring the lower costs of innovation and marketing and to enjoy a premium profits margin furthermore the financial analysis suggests that usana is aggressively expanding with healthy growth metrics despite being a highly profitable firm the company is on sales at a bargain as indicated by its pe of  last but not least we expect the company to continue to generate substantial sales growth and to reward the patience and intelligent shareholders as the firm deepens its campaign into asiapacific if you enjoy reading our research be sure to click the follow button for latest insights to receive

requirements commenting on the relatively high cost of usanas supplements anthony almada chief scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm imaginutrition told forbes the economic reality of usana and other multilevel marketing entities mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts these comments were supported by natural health product specialist prof jeanlouis brazier of the university of montreals faculty of pharmacy who examined usanas products for radiocanadas consumer report show la facture brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent storebought items and no evidence that usanas products were of better quality than their competitors john cloud senior writer for time magazine conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of usana pills protein bars powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the companys online evaluation cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium protein sodium cholesterol glucose and other substances and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen which included  pills at a cost of  the followup test revealed a change in only two values a  increase in vitamin d levels attributed to the vitamin d supplement cloud had been taking and a  mgdl increase in highdensity lipoprotein which could not be accounted for cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present this response also led to a lb increase in weight as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the licensing effect business modeledit usana a multilevel marketing company sells its products primarily via nonemployee distributors known as sales associates as well as via the internet associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a downline usanas compensation plan awards commissionable points for sales volume when the points reach a predetermined number the associate is paid if the points do not reach the payment threshold they accumulate towards the next week the firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of  volume of products equivalent to approximately – every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation if this minimum is not maintained the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid according to documentation from usana corporate  of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with  of all associates making no commission  of the companys commissions are earned by the top  of associates according to a  article published by the salt lake city tribune the firms fy income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the companys  associates which includes those just starting out was  while the topofthepyramid distributors earn an average of  annually the firms  income disclosure statement defines associates as those who are actively building a business acting as wholesale buyers or are new distributors the firms  sec k filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers associates are independent distributors of usana products who also purchase their products for personal use preferred customers may purchase products at wholesale prices strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute as of july  the firm had  active associates and  preferred customers usanas associates are bound by distributor agreements which forbid distributors from making misleading income claims to potential associates and from making health claims for the products however an investigative report aired by radiocanada in february  which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions found that one group of associates appeared to violate the companys policies the program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the canadian legal requirements for multilevel marketing schemes to provide clear frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant in addition the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using usana products to treat illnesses including leukemia in  two canadian usana distributors were awarded  million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company the firm had terminated their positions in  because it believed the distributor had violated the companies policies and procedures new zealand government statistician for the commerce commission dr murray h smith who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the commission preceding  years opined in  that very few usana distributors are likely to become wealthy and stating you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme when asked by the national business review to review the firms business structure and compensation plan it was smith’s opinion from a statistical not legal standpoint that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others dr smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit sponsorshipsedit athleticsedit usana is a paid sponsor of various athletic organizations usana offers an athlete guarantee program to select sponsored athletes the program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance included in world antidoping agency

discovery institute distributed a page report to officials at the us securities and exchange commission sec the federal bureau of investigation fbi and the internal revenue service irs accusing usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme usana countered by lodging suits against minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation according to an article published in the san diego reader usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the sec the sec conducted a probe of usanas business practices in march  and found nothing incriminating concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended the companys longtime auditing firm grant thornton resigned in july  because it could not agree with usana on procedures for an outside independent investigation of the charges because it had no auditor usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with sec and nasdaq requirementscitation needed on the day minkows report was released usanas shares had traded at  but by august the share price had tumbled to less than  minkow acknowledged that he was shorting usanas shares hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price however in reference to usanas lawsuit news columnist herb greenberg commented that the criticism of minkow is a bunch of malarkey he has a right to publish his research as long as people know his position in the stock minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down usana dropped the defamation suit and in march  us district judge tena campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by usana against minkow ruling that usanas claims violated californias antislapp law for suing minkow for fair criticism and that usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims the judge also cited two examples where usana failed to refute minkows claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lowerpriced brands the remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in july  when usana and minkow reached an undisclosed settlement which included the removal of all usanarelated materials from the fraud discovery institute website a related chinese website and from youtube minkow also agreed to never trade in usanas stock again separately from the settlement the company paid  in attorney fees to minkow and his institute under an order from federal magistrate samuel alba court documents show that usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction their only avenue of release in this case minkow had previously served a year prison term starting in  for stock fraud minkow has since returned to prison in  for securities fraud unrelated

usana and other multilevel marketing entities mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through

statement defines associates as those who are actively building a business acting as wholesale buyers or are new distributors the firms  sec k filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers associates are independent distributors of usana products who also purchase their products for personal use preferred customers may purchase products at wholesale prices strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute as of july  the firm had  active associates and  preferred customers usanas associates are bound by distributor agreements which forbid distributors from making misleading income claims to potential associates and from making health claims for the products however an investigative report aired by radiocanada in february  which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions found that one group of associates appeared to violate the companys policies the program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the canadian legal requirements for multilevel marketing schemes to provide clear frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant in addition the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using usana products to treat illnesses including leukemia in  two canadian usana distributors

commission preceding  years opined in  that very few usana distributors are likely to become wealthy and stating you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme when asked by the national business review to review the firms business structure and compensation plan it was smith’s opinion from a statistical not legal standpoint that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others dr smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to

of operating an illegal pyramid scheme usana countered by lodging suits against minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation according to an article published in the san diego reader usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the sec the sec conducted a probe of usanas business practices in march  and found nothing incriminating concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended the companys longtime auditing firm grant thornton resigned in july  because it could not agree with usana on procedures for an outside independent investigation of the

reference to usanas lawsuit news columnist herb greenberg commented that the criticism of minkow is a bunch of malarkey he has a right to publish his research as long as people know his position in the stock minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down usana dropped the defamation suit and in march  us district judge tena campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by usana against minkow ruling that usanas claims violated californias antislapp law for suing minkow for fair criticism and that usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims the judge also cited two examples where usana failed to refute minkows claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lowerpriced brands the remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in july  when usana and minkow reached an undisclosed settlement which included the removal of all usanarelated materials from the fraud discovery institute website a related chinese website and from youtube minkow also agreed to never trade in usanas stock again separately from the settlement the company paid  in attorney fees to minkow and his institute under an order from federal magistrate samuel alba court documents show that usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction their only avenue of release in this case minkow had previously served a year prison term starting in  for stock fraud minkow has since returned to prison in  for securities fraud unrelated

claims brought by usana against minkow ruling that usanas claims violated californias antislapp law for suing minkow for fair criticism and that usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims the judge also cited two examples where usana failed to refute minkows claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lowerpriced brands the remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in july  when usana and minkow reached an undisclosed settlement which included the removal of all usanarelated materials from the fraud discovery institute website a related chinese website and from youtube minkow also agreed to never trade in usanas stock again separately from the settlement the company paid  in attorney fees to minkow and his institute

and meeting us food and drug administration fda labeling requirements commenting on the relatively high cost of usanas supplements anthony almada chief scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm imaginutrition told forbes the economic reality of usana and other multilevel marketing entities mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts these comments were supported by natural health product specialist prof jeanlouis brazier of the university of montreals faculty of pharmacy who examined usanas products for radiocanadas consumer report show la facture brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent storebought items and no evidence that usanas products were of better quality than their competitors john cloud senior writer for time magazine conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of usana pills protein bars powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the companys online evaluation cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium protein sodium cholesterol glucose and other substances and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen which included  pills at a cost of  the followup test revealed a change in only two values a  increase in vitamin d levels attributed to the vitamin d supplement cloud had been taking and a  mgdl increase in highdensity lipoprotein which could not be accounted for cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present this response also led to a lb increase in weight as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the licensing effect business modeledit usana a multilevel marketing company sells its products primarily via nonemployee distributors known as sales associates as well as via the internet associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a downline usanas compensation plan awards commissionable points for sales volume when the points reach a predetermined number the associate is paid if the points do not reach the payment threshold they accumulate towards the next week the firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of  volume of products equivalent to approximately – every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation if this minimum is not maintained the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid according to documentation from usana corporate  of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with  of all associates making no commission  of the companys commissions are earned by the top  of associates according to a  article published by the salt lake city tribune the firms fy income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the companys  associates which includes those just starting out was  while the topofthepyramid distributors earn an average of  annually the firms  income disclosure statement defines associates as those who are actively building a business acting as wholesale buyers or are new distributors the firms  sec k filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers associates are independent distributors of usana products who also purchase their products for personal use preferred customers may purchase products at wholesale prices strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute as of july  the firm had  active associates and  preferred customers usanas associates are bound by distributor agreements which forbid distributors from making misleading income claims to potential associates and from making health claims for the products however an investigative report aired by radiocanada in february  which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions found that one group of associates appeared to violate the companys policies the program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the canadian legal requirements for multilevel marketing schemes to provide clear frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant in addition the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using usana products to treat illnesses including leukemia in  two canadian usana distributors were awarded  million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company the firm had terminated their positions in  because it believed the distributor had violated the companies policies and procedures new zealand government statistician for the commerce commission dr murray h smith who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the commission preceding  years opined in  that very few usana distributors are likely to become wealthy and stating you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme when asked by the national business review to review the firms business structure and compensation plan it was smith’s opinion from a statistical not legal standpoint that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others dr smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit sponsorshipsedit athleticsedit usana is a paid sponsor of various athletic organizations usana offers an athlete

present this response also led to a lb increase in weight as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the licensing effect business modeledit usana a multilevel marketing company sells its products primarily via nonemployee distributors known as sales associates as well as via the internet associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a downline usanas compensation plan awards commissionable points for sales volume when the points reach a predetermined number the associate is paid if the points do not reach the payment threshold they accumulate towards the next week the firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of  volume of products equivalent to approximately – every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation if this minimum is not maintained the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid according to documentation from usana corporate  of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover

customers may purchase products at wholesale prices strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute as of july  the firm had  active associates and  preferred customers usanas associates are bound by distributor agreements which forbid distributors from making misleading income claims to potential associates and from making health claims for the products however an investigative report aired by radiocanada in february  which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions found that one group of associates appeared to violate the companys policies the program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the canadian legal requirements for multilevel marketing schemes to provide clear frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant in addition the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using usana products to treat illnesses including leukemia in  two canadian usana distributors were awarded  million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company the firm had terminated their

expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the commission preceding  years opined in  that very few usana distributors are likely to become wealthy and stating you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme when asked by the national business review to review the firms business structure and compensation plan it was smith’s opinion from a statistical not legal standpoint that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others dr smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit sponsorshipsedit athleticsedit usana is a paid sponsor of various athletic organizations usana offers an athlete

defamation suit and in march  us district judge tena campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by usana against minkow ruling that usanas claims violated californias antislapp law for suing minkow for fair criticism and that usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims the judge also cited two examples where usana failed to refute minkows claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lowerpriced brands the remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in july  when usana and minkow reached an undisclosed settlement which included the removal of all usanarelated materials from the fraud discovery institute website a related chinese website and from youtube minkow also agreed to never trade in usanas stock again separately from the settlement the company paid  in attorney fees to minkow and his institute under an order from federal magistrate samuel alba court documents show that usana never pursued others

as sales associates as well as via the internet associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a downline usanas compensation plan awards commissionable points for sales volume when the points reach a predetermined number the associate is paid if the points do not reach the payment threshold they accumulate towards the next week the firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of  volume of products equivalent to approximately – every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation if this minimum is not maintained the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid according to documentation from usana corporate  of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with  of all associates making no commission  of the companys commissions are

or to distribute as of july  the firm had  active associates and  preferred customers usanas associates are bound by distributor agreements which forbid distributors from making misleading income claims to potential associates and from making health claims for the products however an investigative report aired by radiocanada in february  which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions found that one group of associates appeared to violate the companys policies the program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the canadian legal requirements for multilevel marketing schemes to provide clear frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant in addition the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using usana products to treat illnesses including leukemia in  two canadian usana distributors were awarded  million in compensation for

zealand government statistician for the commerce commission dr murray h smith who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the commission preceding  years opined in  that very few usana distributors are likely to become wealthy and stating you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme when asked by the national business review to review the firms business structure and compensation plan it was smith’s opinion from a statistical not legal standpoint that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others dr smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit sponsorshipsedit

usana countered by lodging suits against minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation according to an article published in the san diego reader usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the sec the sec conducted a probe of usanas business practices in march  and found nothing incriminating concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended the

columnist herb greenberg commented that the criticism of minkow is a bunch of malarkey he has a right to publish his research as long as people know his position in the stock minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down usana dropped the defamation suit and in march  us district judge tena campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by usana against minkow ruling that usanas claims violated californias antislapp law for suing minkow for fair criticism and that usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims the judge also cited two examples where usana failed to refute minkows claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lowerpriced brands the remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in july  when usana and minkow reached an undisclosed settlement which included the removal of all usanarelated materials from the fraud discovery institute website a related chinese website and from youtube minkow also agreed to never trade in usanas stock again separately from the settlement the company paid  in attorney fees to minkow and his institute under an order from federal
