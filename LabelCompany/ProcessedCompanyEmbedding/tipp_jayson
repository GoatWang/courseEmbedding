tipp  franchise  left menu navigation  franchise  header menu navigation  franchise  main image people  pm •  top players in franchise development jayson tipp as the chief development officer and senior vice president of technology jayson tipp has watched papa murphy’s grow to  locations by alison hoesli  contributor jayson tipp joined papa murphy’s in  as the senior vice president of technology after transitioning between roles in consumer strategy marketing and development at starbucks potbelly and most recently redbox in  tipp was promoted to chief development officer and senior vice president of technology at papa murphy’s the experienced industry leader is now responsible for franchise sales real estate and construction with a focus on senior leadership for key strategic initiatives related to longterm growth strategies in technology  franchise recently spoke with tipp to learn more about what he has in store for papa murphy’s in the years to come what makes papa murphy’s franchise development process tick i think the reason our development is successful is the same reason we’ve been so successful as a brand papa murphy’s has a differentiated concept and product we provide an uncooked product with a great value proposition and a low investment opportunity on top of that we have unparalleled customer loyalty our most common lead generator is our storefront many of our franchise candidates say they were once passionate customers before becoming franchise owners which has not only helped us develop in existing markets but additionally break into new territories what have been some of papa murphy’s major milestones in my time at papa murphy’s our major milestone was when we surpassed  stores in  we now have the attainable goal of opening the largest number of stores we have ever opened in one year it’s an exciting time to be a part of a growing brand what are you most proud of one of the reasons i like the development role in a franchise organization is that you become the problem solver i’ve been an outlet to help franchisees open stores faster smooth out the development process negotiate a lease and renew store costs it’s not the frequent problems franchisees deal with daytoday on the ground floor but it’s meaningful and a real benefit to them i’m proud that i’m able to help make that process easier what specific steps do your most successful franchisees take in order to build and grow their respective businesses franchisees need to understand the business and the investment that they’re making they need to be thoughtful in planning their growth strategies and know the risks involved with expansion those that take the risks too lightly tend to underestimate what it might take to build a thriving business through the ups and downs what are your goals for your brand in the next few years and how do you plan to grow the brand we have some published growth goals in terms of our new store openings we’d like to triple the size of our business long term in the us we’ d also like to make openings an easier more turnkey process for franchisees while ensuring success in the longterm moving forward make
