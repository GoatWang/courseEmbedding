conditions investors units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost principal investment strategy the trust seeks to provide current income with the potential for capital appreciation by investing in dividendpaying stocks of global companies along with shares of exchangetraded funds “etfs” that invest substantially all of their assets in fixedincome securities the sponsor with the assistance of guggenheim partners investment management llc “gpim” an affiliate of guggenheim partners llc has selected the securities to be included in the trust’s portfolio the trust portfolio will invest a substantial amount of its assets either directly or indirectly through its investment in etfs in securities from at least three different countries as defined by russell investments the trust will as of the initial date of deposit invest at least  of its assets directly or indirectly in the securities of nonus companies located in at least three different countries as defined by russell investments the sponsor and gpim believe that companies that distribute significant dividends on a consistent basis generally demonstrate strong financial strength and positive performance relative to their peers the common stocks selected will constitute approximately  of the trust portfolio shares of etfs that invest substantially all of their assets in fixedincome securities will make up the remaining  of the trust portfolio the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio invest in a wide range of both domestic and international debt securities rated investmentgrade through below investmentgrade highyield below investmentgrade securities or “junk” bonds are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks than investmentgrade securities the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio will invest in debt securities with shortterm mediumterm and longterm maturities typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes finally the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio will invest in debt securities issued by foreign companies including companies located in emerging markets and municipal bonds selection criteria united states equity strategy approximately  of the trust portfolio will constitute us equity common stocks selected using a disciplined process that includes both quantitative screening and qualitative analysis these common stocks may be issued by small mid and largecapitalization companies and by real estate investment trusts the sponsor selects us companies that it believes should be core holdings of a diversified dividendpaying portfolio the sponsor begins with a universe of all dividend paying companies in the united states as of the date of the security selection the sponsor then selects the final portfolio by performing quantitative and qualitative screening which is primarily based on but not limited to dividend growth dividend coverage and profitability international equity strategy approximately  of the trust portfolio will constitute common stocks selected according to a quantitative dividend strategy these stocks will be dividend paying american depositary receipt “adr”global depositary receipt “gdr”new york registry share equity securities or uslisted common stocks of foreign companies representing both developed and emerging markets the common stocks may be issued by small mid and largecapitalization companies fixedincome exchangetraded funds approximately  of the trust portfolio will constitute etfs that invest substantially all of their assets in both domestic and international fixedincome securities the sponsor with the assistance of gpim has selected fixedincome etfs believed to have the best potential for current income when selecting the etfs for the trust the sponsor considers a number of factors including but not limited to the size liquidity and daily trading volume the current dividend yield the strategy and investment objective the fixedincome securities held by the etf the expense ratio and the overlap of the underlying fixedincome securities held by the etfs risks and other considerations as with all investments you may lose some or all of your investment in the trust no assurance can be given that the trust’s investment objective will be achieved the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these • securities prices can be volatile the value of your investment may fall over time market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include stock market movements purchases or sales of securities by the trust government policies litigation and changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of the securities’ issuer or even perceptions of the issuer units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency • the trust invests in shares of etfs etfs are investment pools that hold other securities the etfs in the trust are usually passivelymanaged index funds that seek to replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index etfs are subject to various risks including management’s ability to meet the fund’s investment objective shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors the underlying etf has management and operating expenses consequently you will bear not only your share of your trust’s expenses but also the expenses of the underlying etfs by investing in etfs the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etfs • the etfs are subject to annual fees and expenses including a management fee unitholders of the trust will bear these fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust see “fees and expenses” for additional information • the trust is subject to an etf’s index correlation risk to the extent that an underlying etf is an indextracking etf index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an etf will vary from the actual performance of the fund’s target index known as “tracking error” this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spinoffs and timing variances • the value of the fixedincome securities etfs will generally fall if interest rates in general rise typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes the trust may be subject to greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates • an etf or an issuer of securities held by an etf may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments andor to declare distributions in the future may call a security before its stated maturity or may reduce the level of distributions declared issuers may suspend dividends during the life of the trust this may result in a reduction in the value of your units • the financial condition of an etf or an issuer of securities held by an etf may worsen resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period • economic conditions may lead to limited liquidity and greater volatility the markets for fixedincome securities such as those held by certain etfs may experience periods of illiquidity and volatility general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of fixedincome securities these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the securities held by an etf uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings • certain etfs held by the trust invest in securities that are rated below investmentgrade and are considered to be “junk” securities below investmentgrade obligations are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks and accordingly the risk of nonpayment or default is higher than with investmentgrade securities in addition such securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and more likely to receive early returns of principal in falling rate environments • certain etfs held by the trust may invest in securities that are rated as investmentgrade by only one rating agency as a result such splitrated securities may have more speculative characteristics and are subject to a greater risk of default than securities rated as investmentgrade by more than one rating agency • the trust invests in uslisted foreign securities a new york registry share and adrs and certain etfs held by the trust may invest in foreign securities investment in foreign securities presents additional risk adrs are issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by foreign corporations new york registry shares are created by a us registrar so that securities of companies incorporated in the netherlands may be traded on a us exchange securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those of domestic securities more specifically foreign risk is the risk that foreign securities will be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as adverse economic currency political social or regulatory developments in a country including government seizure of assets excessive taxation limitations on the use or transfer of assets the lack of liquidity or regulatory controls with respect to certain industries or differing legal andor accounting standards • the trust and certain etfs held by the trust invest in securities issued by companies headquartered in countries considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance companies headquartered in emerging market countries may be exposed to greater volatility and market risk • certain etfs held by the trust may invest in securities whose value may be dependent on currency exchange rates the us dollar value of these securities may vary with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the us dollar for various economic and political reasons such as the activity level of large international commercial banks various central banks speculators hedge funds and other buyers and sellers of foreign currencies • the trust invests in securities issued by midcapitalization companies and certain etfs held by the trust may invest in securities issued by smallcapitalization andor midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments • share prices or distributions on the securities in the trust may decline during the life of the trust there is no guarantee that share prices of the securities in the trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare distributions in the future and if declared whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time • inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments • the sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio the trust will generally hold and may when creating additional units continue to buy the same securities even though a security’s outlook market value or yield may have changed see “investment risks” in part a of the prospectus and “risk factors” in part b of the prospectus for additional

the federal reserve fed increased interest rates and said it expects one more increase this year if the economy performs as expected in addition the fed detailed a plan for unwinding its balance sheet which could begin before the end of  news of high inventory levels and rising production in certain countries drove oil prices to a sevenmonth low us employment report data announced at the beginning of june disappointed despite the disappointment relative to expectations the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in  years favoring equities during the month helped performance as rates moved up and global equities continued to outperform us core fixed income broadly our positioning in credit was also a benefit as high yield outperformed both core fixed income and government bonds looking ahead we maintain conviction in our prorisk positioning as better global economic growth and relatively slow tightening by global central banks remain supportive of risk assets we continue to favor equities broadly across regions and look to diversify our credit exposure within fixed income international equities are currently about  of our total equity allocation including real estate investment trusts we continue to find european equities particularly attractive given strong economic and earnings momentum lower nearterm political risks and generally attractive yields in the region our exposure to equities is at the highest level since mid we continue to believe that credit will be the most attractive area within fixed income while we have maintained a sizeable allocation to high yield we began to diversify our credit exposure by reducing high yield and marginally increasing our allocation to emerging markets debt we believe that high yield spreads are relatively tight and the returns on the asset class will likely come from the income component rather than capital appreciation going forward however highyield fundamentals remain supportive so we still believe the
