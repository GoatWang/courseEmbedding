property tour investors recap   comments   ​the watermark partners leadership team want to thank the  investors that participated in our recent investor presentation in ann arbor and the  investors that attended our investor tour that day  we all enjoyed the opportunity to get to know you better and appreciate the effort that you made to be therewe are delighted to share one of our investor attendees analysis of watermark below “super impressed with the team with the properties with the thoughtfulness they gave to our questions i especially liked their balanced approach to meeting the tenants needs creating a good product while extracting as much value from the properties as possible the region is more nuanced than expected lots of opportunity to do good for tenants while making more outsized returns very solid teama few things that really struck me through the day    • while the fund is concentrated in one region of the country  on one asset class within that there is an interesting amount of diversity found in the fund    • demographics some section  housing they can dial up or down and in some places like toledo oh there are new funds that increase the amount available for supplementing rent some that cater to university post graduates some to older tenants and some to regular blue collar folks i really liked the nuance between the different cities in the fund like detroit there are depressed values but unlike detroit there are some really good demographics that make solid tenants    • size of apartments from dozen or so up to s    • they have a good strategy in buying up apartments near each other with an eye for making them attractive as a package for institutional investors    • they are strong operators spent a good bit of time with stewart beal in the car between stops he is a nose to the grind kind of guy who obviously has great attention to detail was obvious from the many questions he answered about everything from payment collection to rent management software to process for handling tough tenants to litigation process to screening tenants etc justin seems equally so mth property management    • they are a balanced team stewart is mr operations elan knows how to manage the banks for the all important good terms john is really deep in acquisition and getting all off market deals tom is deeply connected to the institutional side former wall street their new additions for market research and accounting seem to be smart moves each had a good grasp on the business even though brad was just  weeks on the job    • they are leveraging their research not just for investor relationsdue diligence but as a tool to get better loan terms their toledo oh package has really been a hit with the city  the banks    • they are thoughtful on how the spend the money adding brad  steve only happened after they received enough coc flow to afford adding them     • they dont waste money on investors we had the crappiest bagels and i was joking with another investor that this proved they were not wasteful because those were the cheapest bagels i think anyone could find    • i had mentioned to tom that he should check out crowd street for business platform a few weeks ago  they are already in beta test with the integration to provide investors with a nice portal to manage all communications they now have over  investors so tom is really thankful as this will allow him to scale btw that product is pretty cheap cant share the amount but i asked him personally    • i got to meet toms inlaws some of the partners families stewarts father etc it is a bit more soft but you do get a feeling about a team when you spend time with them in a social setting    • while i am sure they carefully chose the apartments for us to see it was clear that they do simple things to make the quality of life a bit better for the tenants like landscaping paving clean apartments etc it was interesting to watch stewart go out of his way when i dont think anyone was watching to pick up a piece of paper that was somewhere on the property    • they very rarely compete on offers they rely on pocket deals or straight deals with sellers stewart has been in the area a long time the other two management companies have strong relationships as well since they have never failed to close a deal they find deals come to them     • they are definitely strong negotiators on the purchase side     • they look for deals that have a bonus room one funny story at the end of a walk through the agent said do you want to see the house too the house wasnt listed but was part of the deal so they got a bonus house to rent another one in one apartment complex there was a room not on the rent roll had a sofa  tv turns out the owner would tell his wife he was going out but instead go to that room and watch tv  in most of their deals they find unrealized opportunities    • they do nice stuff to the apartments but they dont do too much they seem to have a good sense on what they can put off that doesnt sacrifice livability    • no bs detectors went off no slimy sales pitches just seems like smart guys who have found a great niche in the market healthy fear of leverage but use it within bounds get good long term rates etcend of the day i was very happy that i am in the fund  i certainly came away with a much more nuanced view of that region of michigan  ohio”  comments watermark team in miami  nyc  midwest investor tour june th    comments   thank you again to all that attended our multiple investor

actually do we help investors succeed   watermark capital partners llc is a new york based mortgage investment fund that buys distressed whole loans from financial institutions hedge funds and private equity firms that specialize in note buying at significant discounts off of the outstanding balances owed on the loans the notes are secured by a lien interest in the property perfected by a mortgage or deed of trust they are purchased at a discounted percentage of the current market value of the property we then attempt to either assist the homeowner to start paying again with various incentives or pursue foreclosure to then be able to liquidate the asset at a profit in order to purchase note portfolios at the severely discounted rates available because of relationships and expertise that watermark capital has developed to source these assets wmc is seeking qualified investors to partner with the current market conditions support this unique opportunity to purchase bulk quantity nonperforming notes and improve the quality of the collateral wmc has the knowledge and expertise to source the notes manage the work out and reperformance processotherwise known as ‘home retention’

mandatory of lenders’ servicers when dealing with consumers these firms have the necessary licenses to satisfy all of the federal and state requirements recently implemented to protect consumers from egregious lenders and servicers the opportunity to net a high yield return with relatively low risk exists because these notes are purchased with a  secured lien on real property  at loan to value
