world are labeled emerging markets for many years investors treated emerging markets as an alternative investment today emerging marketsand in particular emerging market bondsare an exciting asset class all their own they offer the opportunity to invest in almost seventy countries that represent close to half of global output payden  rygels emerging market bond strategies can be used as standalone investment vehicles or they can used in a broader portfolio to provide diversification and potentially enhance returns the firms investment process starts with a topdown assessment of country risk accompanied by research trips to countries in latin america europe asia africa and the middle east we assess country trajectories through a screening of their macroeconomic variables business environment political stability and the quality of their environmental social and government institutions our robust relative value and risk management tools help to ensure diversification

due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal cash management payden  rygel is a pioneer in developing cash management strategies for institutions which we began more than a quartercentury ago since then this strategy which focuses on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds has been refined and enhanced our strategy helps institutions maximize the return on shortterm resources by deploying funds in the shortterm money marketswhere they maintain a high degree of security and liquidity the money markets include shortterm debt securities like commercial paper negotiable certificates of deposit and treasury billsall with maturities of less than a year but usually less than  days expert navigation of the vast money markets is essential to successfully managing shortterm cash the value of fixed income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal enhanced cashlow durationlow duration plus payden  rygel pioneered cash management strategies for institutions nearly three decades ago since that time our shortterm bond strategies which initially focused on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds have expanded to meet the dynamic needs of our clients and the everchanging investment landscape our shortterm bond strategies are designed for investors who seek higher yields than those provided by money market funds but can withstand varying amounts of incremental price volatility customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client the firms shortterm bond strategies offer a high quality diversified alternative to money market funds and other shortterm investments today payden  rygels shortterm bond strategies generally fall into three broad categories enhanced cash low duration and low duration plus enhanced cash the enhanced cash strategy offers a higher yielding alternative to shortterm investments such as money market funds and bank certificates of deposit shortmaturity government securities and nongovernment securities such as corporate bonds assetbacked

average credit quality aa low duration the low duration strategy is an alternative to cash and shortterm bank deposits designed for investors seeking higher yields than generally available from money market funds and who are slightly more tolerant of principal fluctuation the portfolio structure is based upon a clients liquidity requirements typical clients include corporate operating funds

strategy is designed for investors who seek a potentially higher return than that available from a pure low duration strategy and who can withstand a moderate amount of principal fluctuation while this strategy employs the same type of securities as the low duration strategy eg short maturity government and nongovernment securities including corporate bonds assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities it may also include investments with a slightly longer maturity and a lower credit quality the overall portfolio maintains a similar credit quality to the low duration strategy benchmark

by providing a diversification benefit to other higher volatility assets in the portfolio we strive to act as a requisite diversifier in the context of the total pension plan with the everincreasing blurring between asset classes we expect to deliver return and volatility characteristics in keeping with the spirit of bond expectations we believe that bond portfolios should be sufficiently diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors and that individual position sizes in the portfolio should be calibrated to their potential degree of risk in addition to the strategies listed below we offer a complete array of services including index replication strategies and liabilitydriven investing intermediate our intermediate core bond strategy strikes a compromise between yield on the one hand and price volatility on the other this strategy offers a slightly lower yield than other core bond alternatives due to its shorter average maturity that helps protect against adverse price moves

return by focusing on the upper tier of the highyield bond market highyield bonds can provide diversification and yield benefits to an investment portfolio due to their low correlation with both treasuries and investmentgrade corporate bonds the cornerstone of payden  rygels highyield strategy is its intensive credit due diligence with an experienced portfolio manager and a seasoned analyst team payden  rygel successfully navigated the credit market turmoil in both  and  the firm prides itself on its risk controls and risk discipline we consider all companies which have bonds above

taxsensitive strategies seek to maximize aftertax total return and are customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client as well as clients tax status and state of domicile we believe that superior performance is derived through the inclusion of both taxable and taxexempt securities in the portfolio opportunity set the segmented nature of the municipal taxexempt market leads to inefficiencies that can translate into excess returns for those managers with the experience sophistication and flexibility to capitalize on these opportunities we believe municipal investing requires elements of both a topdown as well as bottomup investment style market surveillance plays a critical role in the municipal market given the significant influence that supply and demand imbalances exert on performance short term shortterm tax sensitive strategies seek to earn higher income than money market alternatives while preserving capital shortmaturity municipal bonds as well as treasury

income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal strategic income strategic income has its roots in core fixed income but expands from there in a more comprehensive and opportunistic fashion it is designed as a more open architecture approach that is less conforming to traditional fixed income benchmarks this approach has gained favor from investors who recognize that there should not be a one size fits all approach to core style portfolios clients have many different degrees of liquidity needs and beta exposure desires and strategic income in the way we manage it at payden  rygel offers this degree of customization the strategy allocates to major credit sectors globally in a diversified fashion short term andor highquality government securities will also be used to ensure liquidity and ease of strategy change as well as potentially providing a safe haven in times of major credit stress active rotation among the sectors follows paydens timetested macro view through its investment policy committee and coordination with our core fixed income team the payden style of bonds behaving like bonds should is not lost in strategic income portfolios  our focus is on cash bonds and not derivative strategies that can obfuscate risk and return sources importantly effective interest rate

potential rising stars  companies that we believe will be upgraded to investment grade in the near term a forward looking approach is taken to credit analysis a priority is placed on assessing a

interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal longduration investing ldi payden  rygel’s investment philosophy for longduration investing ldi is that active management of fixedincome investments not only should focus on ways to add value relative to a benchmark but should also focus on managing risk in its many forms eg credit liquidity etc consistent with the letter and spirit of our clients’ unique investment guidelines our investment process is a hybrid – we manage a macrodriven topdown approach combined with a bottomup fundamental view the process begins with our investment policy committee’s assessment of the global macroeconomic environment and formation of our broadbased and longterm view on interest rates economic growth inflation political risk credit direction strength supplydemand and risk primarily focused on downside risk and client portfolio protection the long duration investment team based on discussions with the ipc and our sector strategists will determine sector weightings and then populate these targets with individual issuers to achieve attractive riskadjusted return expectations we maintain diversified portfolios typically holding  bonds in order to properly manage tracking error and we employ strong risk controls our ldi strategy exploits opportunities in the longer end of the maturity curve ten

takes advantage of the firms strengths in company and industry analysis focusing on companies which are projected to maintain or increase their dividend payouts while providing abovemarketaverage dividend yields our objective is to provide current income and equity market participation through a welldiversified highquality largecap portfolio by focusing on companies with steady earnings and cash flow growth our equity team looks beyond the common stock universe for attractive dividenddistribution yields and researches other areas such as preferred stock real estate investment trusts master limited partnerships and business development companies the strategy is welldiversified across sectors and equity security types and generally invests in  holdings with the focus on diversification income and equity market participation this strategy is appropriate for both investors focusing on income and those looking for a competitive largecap value offering with lower volatility and attractive riskadjusted returns stocks in this strategy will generally appreciate less when than the overall market is rising and fall less when the overall market is declining investors could lose money during periods of falling stock prices the absolute return investing universe has represented a variety of investment objectives and approaches through time even today the term is used by both hedge funds on one end of the spectrum as well as ultrasafe liquidity type funds on the other while the space has yet to be concretely defined the development of our strategy began with a simple client request to manage a portfolio untethered from traditional benchmarks that would produce a reasonable level of return and protect their investment principal with that

by providing a diversification benefit to other higher volatility assets in the portfolio we strive to act as a requisite diversifier in the context of the total pension plan with the everincreasing blurring between asset classes we expect to deliver return and volatility characteristics in keeping with the spirit of bond expectations we believe that bond portfolios should be sufficiently

offer a complete array of services including index replication strategies and liabilitydriven investing intermediate our intermediate core bond strategy strikes a compromise between yield on the one hand and price volatility on the other this strategy offers a slightly lower yield than other core bond alternatives due to its shorter average maturity that helps protect against adverse price moves

treasuries and investmentgrade corporate bonds the cornerstone of payden  rygels highyield strategy is its intensive credit due diligence with an experienced portfolio manager and a seasoned analyst team payden  rygel successfully navigated the credit market turmoil in both  and  the firm prides itself on its risk controls and risk discipline we consider all companies which have bonds above

that superior performance is derived through the inclusion of both taxable and taxexempt securities in the portfolio opportunity set the segmented nature of the municipal taxexempt market leads to inefficiencies that can translate into excess returns for those managers with the experience sophistication and flexibility to capitalize on these opportunities we believe municipal investing requires elements of both a topdown as well as bottomup investment style market surveillance plays a critical role in the municipal market given the significant influence that supply and demand imbalances

income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal strategic income strategic income has its roots in core fixed income but expands from there in a more comprehensive and opportunistic fashion it is designed as a more open architecture approach that is less conforming to traditional fixed income benchmarks this approach has gained favor from investors who recognize that there should not be a one size fits all approach to core style portfolios clients have many different degrees of liquidity needs and beta exposure desires and strategic income in the way we manage it at payden  rygel offers this degree of customization the strategy allocates to major credit sectors globally in a diversified fashion

management of fixedincome investments not only should focus on ways to add value relative to a benchmark but should also focus on managing risk in its many forms eg credit liquidity etc consistent with the letter and spirit of our clients’ unique investment guidelines our investment process is a hybrid – we manage a macrodriven topdown approach combined with a bottomup fundamental view the process begins with our investment policy committee’s assessment of the global macroeconomic environment and formation of our broadbased and longterm view on interest rates economic growth inflation political risk credit direction strength supplydemand and risk primarily focused on downside risk and client portfolio protection the long duration investment team based on discussions with the ipc and our sector strategists will determine sector weightings and then populate these targets with individual issuers to achieve attractive riskadjusted return expectations we maintain diversified portfolios typically holding  bonds in order to properly manage tracking error and we employ strong risk controls our ldi strategy exploits opportunities in the longer end of the maturity curve ten

dividend yields our objective is to provide current income and equity market participation through a welldiversified highquality largecap portfolio by focusing on companies with steady earnings and cash flow growth our equity team looks beyond the common stock universe for attractive dividenddistribution yields and researches other areas such as preferred stock real estate investment trusts master limited partnerships and business development companies the strategy is welldiversified across sectors and equity security types and generally invests in  holdings with the focus on diversification income and equity market participation this strategy is appropriate for both investors focusing on income and those looking for a competitive largecap value offering with lower volatility and attractive riskadjusted returns stocks in this strategy will generally appreciate less when than the overall market is rising and fall less when the overall market is declining investors could lose money during periods of falling stock prices the absolute return investing universe has represented a variety of investment objectives and approaches through time even today the term is used by both hedge funds on one end of the spectrum as well as ultrasafe liquidity type funds on the other while the space has yet to be concretely defined the development of our strategy

on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds has been refined and enhanced our strategy helps institutions maximize the return on shortterm resources by deploying funds in the shortterm money marketswhere they maintain a high degree of security and liquidity the money markets include shortterm debt securities like commercial paper negotiable certificates of deposit and treasury billsall with maturities of less than a year but usually less than  days expert navigation of the vast money markets is essential to successfully managing shortterm cash the value of fixed income

cash management strategies for institutions nearly three decades ago since that time our shortterm bond strategies which initially focused on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds have expanded to meet the dynamic needs of our clients and the everchanging investment landscape our shortterm bond strategies are designed for investors who seek higher yields than those provided by money market funds but can withstand varying amounts of incremental price volatility customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client the firms shortterm bond strategies offer a high quality diversified alternative to money market funds and other shortterm investments today payden  rygels shortterm bond strategies generally fall into three broad categories enhanced cash low duration and low duration plus enhanced cash the enhanced cash strategy offers a higher yielding alternative to shortterm investments such as money market funds and bank certificates of deposit

special and important role in an overall asset allocation by generating reliable current income and by providing a diversification benefit to other higher volatility assets in the portfolio we strive to act as a requisite diversifier in the context of the total pension plan with the everincreasing blurring between asset classes we expect to deliver return and volatility characteristics in keeping with the spirit of bond expectations we believe that bond portfolios should be sufficiently diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors and that individual position sizes in the portfolio should be calibrated to their potential degree of risk in addition to the strategies listed below we offer a complete array of services including index replication strategies and liabilitydriven investing intermediate our intermediate core bond strategy strikes a compromise between yield on the one hand and price volatility on the other this strategy offers a slightly lower yield than other core bond

diversification and yield benefits to an investment portfolio due to their low correlation with both treasuries and investmentgrade corporate bonds the cornerstone of payden  rygels highyield strategy is its intensive credit due diligence with an experienced portfolio manager and a seasoned analyst team payden  rygel successfully navigated the credit market turmoil in both  and  the firm prides itself on its risk controls and risk discipline we consider all companies which have bonds above  million in issue size our investible universe consists of in excess of  companies though  of these are

investment objectives of each client as well as clients tax status and state of domicile we believe that superior performance is derived through the inclusion of both taxable and taxexempt securities

largecap portfolio by focusing on companies with steady earnings and cash flow growth our equity team looks beyond the common stock universe for attractive dividenddistribution yields and researches other areas such as preferred stock real estate investment trusts master limited partnerships and business development companies the strategy is welldiversified across sectors and equity security types and generally invests in  holdings with the focus on diversification income and equity market participation this strategy is appropriate for both investors focusing on income and those looking for a competitive largecap value offering with lower volatility and attractive riskadjusted returns stocks in this strategy will generally appreciate less when than the overall market is rising and fall less when the overall market is declining investors could lose money during periods of falling stock prices the absolute return investing universe has represented a variety of investment objectives and approaches through time even today the term is used by both hedge funds on one end of the spectrum as well as ultrasafe liquidity type funds on the other while the space has yet to be

servers is replicated to corresponding servers in the boston location on a live basis throughout each day in addition other servers and databases are backed up sent electronically to boston and restored at the end of each day the firm has established a dedicated highspeed connection between the los angeles and boston offices to facilitate the secure transmission of data backups a number of individuals from the trading portfolio operations information technology compliance and portfolio management departments have been selected to connect remotely to the boston office to complete their daily responsibilities in the event of a disruption to normal business operations the firm has implemented a vmware virtual environment for each of these individuals so that they each have their own

a business continuity event in addition the boston office has capacity to accommodate additional employees if a physical relocation of selected los angeles employees is necessary the firm uses a thirdparty hosted mass notification system to quickly communicate with all employees in the event of a disruption in operations the system allows management to compose a text or voice message notifying employees of the event which is then sent automatically to employees mobile phones home phones and email addresses employees indicate their receipt of the message from their phone or mobile device which allows management to immediately review summary reports of the employees who are aware of the disruption additional instructions and updates can then be sent to all staff as necessary

institutions which we began more than a quartercentury ago since then this strategy which focuses on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds has been refined and enhanced our strategy helps institutions maximize the return on shortterm resources by deploying funds in the shortterm money marketswhere they maintain a high degree of security and liquidity the money markets include shortterm debt securities like commercial paper negotiable certificates of deposit and treasury billsall with maturities of less than a year but usually less than  days expert navigation of the vast money markets is essential to successfully managing shortterm cash the value of fixed income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal enhanced cashlow durationlow duration plus payden  rygel pioneered cash management strategies for institutions nearly three decades ago since that time our shortterm bond strategies which initially focused on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds have expanded to meet the dynamic needs of our clients and the everchanging investment landscape our shortterm bond strategies are designed for investors who seek higher yields than those provided by money market funds but can withstand varying amounts of incremental price volatility customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client the firms shortterm bond strategies offer a high quality diversified alternative to money market funds and other shortterm investments today payden  rygels shortterm bond strategies generally fall into three broad categories enhanced cash low duration and low duration plus enhanced cash the enhanced cash strategy offers a higher yielding alternative to shortterm investments such as money market funds and bank certificates of deposit shortmaturity government securities and nongovernment securities such as corporate bonds assetbacked

this strategy employs the same type of securities as the low duration strategy eg short maturity government and nongovernment securities including corporate bonds assetbacked and mortgagebacked

by providing a diversification benefit to other higher volatility assets in the portfolio we strive to act as a requisite diversifier in the context of the total pension plan with the everincreasing blurring between asset classes we expect to deliver return and volatility characteristics in keeping with the spirit of bond expectations we believe that bond portfolios should be sufficiently diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors and that individual position sizes in the portfolio should be calibrated to their potential degree of risk in addition to the strategies listed below we offer a complete array of services including index replication strategies and liabilitydriven investing intermediate our intermediate core bond strategy strikes a compromise between yield on the one hand and price volatility on the other this strategy offers a slightly lower yield than other core bond alternatives due to its shorter average maturity that helps protect against adverse price moves

return by focusing on the upper tier of the highyield bond market highyield bonds can provide diversification and yield benefits to an investment portfolio due to their low correlation with both treasuries and investmentgrade corporate bonds the cornerstone of payden  rygels highyield strategy is its intensive credit due diligence with an experienced portfolio manager and a seasoned analyst team payden  rygel successfully navigated the credit market turmoil in both  and  the firm prides itself on its risk controls and risk discipline we consider all companies which have bonds above

taxsensitive strategies seek to maximize aftertax total return and are customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client as well as clients tax status and state of domicile we believe that superior performance is derived through the inclusion of both taxable and taxexempt securities in the portfolio opportunity set the segmented nature of the municipal taxexempt market leads to inefficiencies that can translate into excess returns for those managers with the experience sophistication and flexibility to capitalize on these opportunities we believe municipal investing requires elements of both a topdown as well as bottomup investment style market surveillance plays a critical role in the municipal market given the significant influence that supply and demand imbalances

income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal strategic income strategic income has its roots in core fixed income but expands from there in a more comprehensive and opportunistic fashion it is designed as a more open architecture approach that is less conforming to traditional fixed income benchmarks this approach has gained favor from investors who recognize that there should not be a one size fits all approach to core style portfolios clients have many different degrees of liquidity needs and beta exposure desires and strategic income in the way we manage it at payden  rygel offers this degree of customization the strategy allocates to major credit sectors globally in a diversified fashion

management of fixedincome investments not only should focus on ways to add value relative to a benchmark but should also focus on managing risk in its many forms eg credit liquidity etc consistent with the letter and spirit of our clients’ unique investment guidelines our investment process is a hybrid – we manage a macrodriven topdown approach combined with a bottomup fundamental view the process begins with our investment policy committee’s assessment of the global macroeconomic environment and formation of our broadbased and longterm view on interest rates economic growth inflation political risk credit direction strength supplydemand and risk primarily focused on downside risk and client portfolio protection the long duration investment team based on discussions with the ipc and our sector strategists will determine sector weightings and then populate these targets with individual issuers to achieve attractive riskadjusted return expectations we maintain diversified portfolios typically holding  bonds in order to properly manage tracking error and we employ strong risk controls our ldi strategy exploits opportunities in the longer end of the maturity curve ten

takes advantage of the firms strengths in company and industry analysis focusing on companies which are projected to maintain or increase their dividend payouts while providing abovemarketaverage dividend yields our objective is to provide current income and equity market participation through a welldiversified highquality largecap portfolio by focusing on companies with steady earnings and cash flow growth our equity team looks beyond the common stock universe for attractive dividenddistribution yields and researches other areas such as preferred stock real estate investment trusts master limited partnerships and business development companies the strategy is welldiversified across sectors and equity security types and generally invests in  holdings with the focus on diversification income and equity market participation this strategy is appropriate for both investors focusing on income and those looking for a competitive largecap value offering with lower volatility and attractive riskadjusted returns stocks in this strategy will generally appreciate less when than the overall market is rising and fall less when the overall market is declining investors could lose money during periods of falling stock prices the absolute return investing universe has represented a variety of investment objectives and approaches through time even today the term is used by both hedge funds on one end of the spectrum as well as ultrasafe liquidity type funds on the other while the space has yet to be concretely defined the development of our strategy

helps institutions maximize the return on shortterm resources by deploying funds in the shortterm money marketswhere they maintain a high degree of security and liquidity the money markets include shortterm debt securities like commercial paper negotiable certificates of deposit and treasury billsall with maturities of less than a year but usually less than  days expert navigation of the vast

meet the unique investment objectives of each client the firms shortterm bond strategies offer a high quality diversified alternative to money market funds and other shortterm investments today payden

by providing a diversification benefit to other higher volatility assets in the portfolio we strive to act as a requisite diversifier in the context of the total pension plan with the everincreasing blurring between asset classes we expect to deliver return and volatility characteristics in keeping with the spirit of bond expectations we believe that bond portfolios should be sufficiently diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors and that individual position sizes in the portfolio should be calibrated to their potential degree of risk in addition to the strategies listed below we offer a complete array of services including index replication strategies and liabilitydriven investing intermediate our intermediate core bond strategy strikes a compromise between yield on the one hand and price volatility on the other this strategy offers a slightly lower yield than other core bond alternatives due to its shorter average maturity that helps protect against adverse price moves

income portfolios will rise and fall due to changes in interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal strategic income strategic income has its roots in core fixed income but expands from there in a more comprehensive and opportunistic fashion it is designed as a more open architecture approach that is less conforming to traditional fixed income benchmarks this approach has gained favor from investors who recognize that there should not be a one size fits all approach to core style portfolios clients have many different degrees of liquidity needs and beta exposure desires and strategic income in the way we manage it at payden  rygel offers this degree of customization the strategy allocates to major credit sectors globally in a diversified fashion short term andor highquality government securities will also be used to ensure liquidity and ease of strategy change as well as potentially providing a safe haven in times of major credit stress active rotation among the sectors follows paydens timetested macro view through its investment policy committee and coordination with our core fixed income team the payden style of bonds behaving like bonds should is not lost in strategic income portfolios  our focus is on cash bonds and not derivative strategies that can obfuscate risk and return sources importantly effective interest rate

market positions strong cash flow generation stable management teams and predictable earnings the strategy’s focus is on bottomup credit selection with an emphasis placed on adding issues with a nearterm catalyst to outperform our credit research process looks to capitalise on opportunities in the corporate bond market across sectors and maturities including the early identification of potential rising stars  companies that we believe will be upgraded to investment grade in the near term a forward looking approach is taken to credit analysis a priority is placed on assessing a company’s future trajectory and the corresponding risk and opportunities for bondholders under various scenarios the strategy primarily invests in usd investment grade corporate securities with flexibility to opportunistically invest in below investment grade securities the strategy may also utilize futures for duration management benchmark bloomberg barclays us corporate index securities

interest rates and other economic factors investment portfolios could lose principal longduration investing ldi payden  rygel’s investment philosophy for longduration investing ldi is that active management of fixedincome investments not only should focus on ways to add value relative to a benchmark but should also focus on managing risk in its many forms eg credit liquidity etc consistent with the letter and spirit of our clients’ unique investment guidelines our investment process is a hybrid – we manage a macrodriven topdown approach combined with a bottomup fundamental view the process begins with our investment policy committee’s assessment of the global macroeconomic environment and formation of our broadbased and longterm view on interest rates economic growth inflation political risk credit direction strength supplydemand and risk primarily focused on downside risk and client portfolio protection the long duration investment team based on discussions with the ipc and our sector strategists will determine sector weightings and then populate these targets with individual issuers to achieve attractive riskadjusted return expectations we maintain diversified portfolios typically holding  bonds in order to properly manage tracking error and we employ strong risk controls our ldi strategy exploits opportunities in the longer end of the maturity curve ten years and greater across multiple fixed income these sectors include us treasuries agencies global investmentgrade corporate bonds taxable municipal bonds and investment grade emerging market

takes advantage of the firms strengths in company and industry analysis focusing on companies which are projected to maintain or increase their dividend payouts while providing abovemarketaverage dividend yields our objective is to provide current income and equity market participation through a welldiversified highquality largecap portfolio by focusing on companies with steady earnings and cash flow growth our equity team looks beyond the common stock universe for attractive dividenddistribution yields and researches other areas such as preferred stock real estate investment trusts master limited partnerships and business development companies the strategy is welldiversified across sectors and equity security types and generally invests in  holdings with the focus on diversification income and equity market participation this strategy is appropriate for both investors focusing on income and those looking for a competitive largecap value offering with lower volatility and attractive riskadjusted returns stocks in this strategy will generally appreciate less when than the overall market is rising and fall less when the overall market is declining investors could lose money during periods of falling stock prices the absolute return investing universe has represented a variety of investment objectives and approaches through time even today the term is used by both hedge funds on one end of the spectrum as well as ultrasafe liquidity type funds on the other while the space has yet to be concretely defined the development of our strategy began with a simple client request to manage a portfolio untethered from traditional benchmarks that would produce a reasonable level of return and protect their investment principal with that objective in mind the payden absolute return investing pari approach has been refined over more than  years while adhering to the following core objectives produce positive returnsstaying true to the

on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds has been refined and enhanced our strategy helps institutions maximize the return on shortterm resources by deploying funds in the shortterm money marketswhere they maintain a high degree of security and liquidity the money markets include shortterm debt securities like commercial paper negotiable certificates of deposit and treasury billsall with maturities of less than a year but usually less than  days expert navigation of the vast money markets is essential to successfully managing shortterm cash the value of fixed income

cash management strategies for institutions nearly three decades ago since that time our shortterm bond strategies which initially focused on liquidity management of operating funds or sweep funds have expanded to meet the dynamic needs of our clients and the everchanging investment landscape our shortterm bond strategies are designed for investors who seek higher yields than those provided by money market funds but can withstand varying amounts of incremental price volatility customized to meet the unique investment objectives of each client the firms shortterm bond strategies offer a high quality diversified alternative to money market funds and other shortterm investments today payden  rygels shortterm bond strategies generally fall into three broad categories enhanced cash low duration and low duration plus enhanced cash the enhanced cash strategy offers a higher yielding alternative to shortterm investments such as money market funds and bank certificates of deposit

special and important role in an overall asset allocation by generating reliable current income and by providing a diversification benefit to other higher volatility assets in the portfolio we strive to act as a requisite diversifier in the context of the total pension plan with the everincreasing blurring between asset classes we expect to deliver return and volatility characteristics in keeping with the spirit of bond expectations we believe that bond portfolios should be sufficiently diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors and that individual position sizes in the portfolio should be calibrated to their potential degree of risk in addition to the strategies listed below we offer a complete array of services including index replication strategies and liabilitydriven investing intermediate our intermediate core bond strategy strikes a compromise between yield on the one hand and price volatility on the other this strategy offers a slightly lower yield than other core bond

open architecture approach that is less conforming to traditional fixed income benchmarks this approach has gained favor from investors who recognize that there should not be a one size fits all approach to core style portfolios clients have many different degrees of liquidity needs and beta exposure desires and strategic income in the way we manage it at payden  rygel offers this degree of

forward looking approach is taken to credit analysis a priority is placed on assessing a company’s future trajectory and the corresponding risk and opportunities for bondholders under various

ldi payden  rygel’s investment philosophy for longduration investing ldi is that active management of fixedincome investments not only should focus on ways to add value relative to a benchmark but should also focus on managing risk in its many forms eg credit liquidity etc consistent with the letter and spirit of our clients’ unique investment guidelines our investment process is a hybrid – we manage a macrodriven topdown approach combined with a bottomup fundamental view the process begins with our investment policy committee’s assessment of the global macroeconomic environment and formation of our broadbased and longterm view on interest rates economic growth inflation political risk credit direction strength supplydemand and risk primarily focused on downside risk and client portfolio protection the long duration investment team based on discussions with the ipc and our sector strategists will determine sector weightings and then populate these targets with individual issuers to achieve attractive riskadjusted return expectations we maintain diversified portfolios typically holding  bonds in order to properly manage tracking error and we employ strong risk controls

increase their dividend payouts while providing abovemarketaverage dividend yields our objective is to provide current income and equity market participation through a welldiversified highquality largecap portfolio by focusing on companies with steady earnings and cash flow growth our equity team looks beyond the common stock universe for attractive dividenddistribution yields and researches other areas such as preferred stock real estate investment trusts master limited partnerships and business development companies the strategy is welldiversified across sectors and equity security types and generally invests in  holdings with the focus on diversification income and equity market participation this strategy is appropriate for both investors focusing on income and those looking for a competitive largecap value offering with lower volatility and attractive riskadjusted returns stocks in this strategy will generally appreciate less when than the overall market is rising and fall less when the overall market is declining investors could lose money during periods of falling stock prices the absolute return investing universe has represented a variety of investment objectives and approaches through time even today the term is used by both hedge funds on one end of the spectrum as well as ultrasafe liquidity type funds on the other while the space has yet to be concretely defined the development of our strategy began with a simple client request to manage a portfolio untethered from traditional benchmarks that would produce a reasonable level of return and protect their investment principal with that objective in mind the payden absolute return investing pari approach has been refined over more than  years while adhering to the following core objectives

servers is replicated to corresponding servers in the boston location on a live basis throughout each day in addition other servers and databases are backed up sent electronically to boston and restored at the end of each day the firm has established a dedicated highspeed connection between the los angeles and boston offices to facilitate the secure transmission of data backups a number of individuals from the trading portfolio operations information technology compliance and portfolio management departments have been selected to connect remotely to the boston office to complete their daily responsibilities in the event of a disruption to normal business operations the firm has implemented a vmware virtual environment for each of these individuals so that they each have their own remote desktop in boston to which they securely connect using a laptop or desktop computer with an internet connection our expectation is that routine business operations will resume within  hours of a business continuity event in addition the boston office has capacity to accommodate additional employees if a physical relocation of selected los angeles employees is necessary the firm uses a thirdparty hosted mass notification system to quickly communicate with all employees in the event of a disruption in operations the system allows management to compose a text or voice message notifying employees of the event which is then sent automatically to employees mobile phones home phones and email addresses employees indicate their receipt of the message from their phone or mobile device which allows management to immediately review summary reports of the employees who are aware of the disruption additional instructions and updates can then be sent to all staff as necessary

necessary updates to the plan and coordinates ongoing tests of the boston location by a team of employees from various departments the committee also solicits feedback from personnel based on the
