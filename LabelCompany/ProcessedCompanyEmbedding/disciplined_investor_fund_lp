fund overview the grant park futures fund has operated since  a period that includes a wide variety of economic and market cycles our experience has taught us there are three concepts to appreciate when considering an investment in managed futures grant park lp is a multiadvisor commodity pool that invests across global financial and commodity markets managed futures is a divergent asset class and does not operate in a manner that is similar to equity or fixed income funds the agnostic nature of pricedriven investing allows programs to invest by going long anticipating prices will rise or short anticipating prices will fall this in turn allows for potentially profitable investing when markets are rising or falling globally managed futures markets are regulated widely traded and very liquid these factors provide the basis for the diversification and noncorrelated performance profile that managed futures can contribute to an investor’s portfolio diversification is the most frequent reason managed futures are added to a portfolio and this represents two different elements  the diversification of a portfolio’s overall returns and the diversification of a portfolio’s overall volatility the grant park futures fund track record since inception illustrates the periods during which managed futures have performed similar to or differently than equities rolling month returns grant park a units  sp  tr jan    june   ​past performance is no guarantee of future results   the fund has performed positively for the majority of the period since inception an individual investor may experience different results depending on their investment holding period there have been three “crisis” periods during the fund’s existence during the tech bubble  and the financial crisis  the fund provided downside protection positive returns and reduced overall portfolio volatility while equity markets violently corrected during the liquidity bubble    the implementation of quantitative easing fueled extraordinary growth in equities created in part by the excessive liquidity central banks created with zero and negativeinterest rates during this unprecedented period managed futures have made limited positive contribution to a portfolio’s performance but did contribute to a reduction in overall portfolio volatility the normalization of marketdriven interest rates began fitfully during  and is likely to slowly continue for the immediate future we believe this will enable managed futures performance to return to its historical performance profile the grant park futures fund invests on the same core beliefs the fund has held since inception markets move in cycles the preservation of investor capital through rigorous risk management is equally important as is the pursuit of potentially profitable trading opportunities diversification of ctas within the fund provides the broadest manner to achieve performance results that are representative of the managed futures asset class active risk management focused on monitoring all aspects of the fund’s trading execution and financial reporting are essential to retaining the limited partners’ trust commodity trading advisers the ctas who invest on the fund’s behalf invest across the global managed futures markets and typically execute their investment strategies utilizing rigorous systematic investment processes and disciplined or quantitative trading models trading style weighting​ ​ commodity trading advisers program amplitude capital international ltdswitzerland klassik emc capital advisors llcunited states
