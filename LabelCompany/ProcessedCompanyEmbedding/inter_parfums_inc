european based operations jean madar chairman  ceo of inter parfums stated the  increase in jimmy choo fragrance sales was a driving force behind the nearly  increase in net sales by european based operations it is especially gratifying that the growth in jimmy choo brand sales was attributable to womens and mens legacy scents dating back from  and  respectively as well as to the recent launch of spinoff lines jimmy choo leau for women and jimmy choo man ice lanvin made a major comeback in the current first quarter as brand sales rose  thanks to lanvins star performer éclat darpège coupled with the international launch of modern princess rochas fragrance sales increased  based on the strength of the brands historic lines plus initial sales of mademoiselle rochas the first new product initiative since the brand was acquired in  coach fragrances contributed about  million to first quarter sales with the continued rollout of the brands signature scent for women which debuted in mid montblanc brand sales declined  in the current first quarter because of a difficult comparison as there was a  increase in  first quarter sales when the highly successful scent montblanc legend spirit was launched discussing us based operations mr madar noted we are very pleased with the performance of abercrombie  fitch and hollister fragrances they have been growth catalysts for our us based operations since the launch of their respective brands new products in mid and are chiefly responsible for the greater than  increase in sales another reason for the top line growth was an upturn in

current first quarter lanvin brand sales rebounded increasing  which was also attributable to both legacy and new scents with lanvins star performer éclat darpège resuming a growth trend coupled with the international launch of modern princess rochas fragrance sales increased  likewise based on the strength of the brands historic lines plus initial sales of mademoiselle rochas our first new product initiative since we acquired the brand in  he continued coach fragrances contributed about  million to first quarter sales with the continued geographic rollout of the brands signature scent for women which debuted in mid we have high expectations for our first coach scent for men which will unveil in the fall montblanc brand sales declined  in the current first quarter because of a difficult comparison with the same period one year earlier when there was a  increase in sales owing in great part to the highly successful launch and rollout of montblanc legend spirit with the introduction of montblanc legend night planned for the end of the year we would anticipate an upswing in brand sales we have several other fragrances in debuting this year including a multiscent collection for boucheron fragrance duo for karl lagerfeld brand extension for lanvins éclat darpège and new addition to the van cleef  arpels collection extraordinaire assortment discussing us based operations mr madar noted abercrombie  fitch and hollister fragrances drove the growth in sales starting with the launch of abercrombie  fitch first instinct for men and hollister wave for men and women in mid this year these fragrance families are being enlarged with first instinct for women and the wave  duo another reason for the more than  top line growth was a turnaround in anna sui brand sales during the economic downturn in china a major market for the brand we maintained our strong advertising and marketing commitment to anna sui which is being rewarded as the chinese economy improves in addition the brands growing popularity in other asian countries is contributing to the upturn in anna sui fragrance sales which we are exploiting with a major new product launch for the brand later this year with distribution concentrated across asia we expect dunhill brand sales to improve with the launch of icon racing late in the year building upon the established success of the icon fragrance family russell greenberg executive vice president and cfo of inter parfums inc stated our blended gross profit margin declined slightly within our european based operations primarily due to product mix and increased costs relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions which aggregated  million and  million for the first quarters of  and  respectively and
