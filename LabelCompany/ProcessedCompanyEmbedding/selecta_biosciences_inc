sel in development for chronic severe gout jun   selecta biosciences inc announced data from its ongoing phase  trial of sel svprapamycin in combination with the uricase enzyme pegsiticase which is being developed for patients with chronic severe gout key observations and findings based upon the clinical data generated through june   from the  patients currently enrolled in this openlabel dose ranging phase  trial include mitigated antidrug antibodies adas after repeat monthly administrations of sel – the prevention of adas in a dosedependent manner resulted in durable control of serum uric acid sua levels defined as sua  mgdl the clinical data demonstrate a correlation between the prevention of adas and the maintenance of pegsiticase activity and serum uric acid control demonstrated induction of immune tolerance – a majority of patients in the minimum effective dose group maintained sua control following three monthly injections of sel and two monthly “challenge” injections of pegsiticase alone maintenance of sua in the challenge portion of the trial provides evidence at this stage that the use of svprapamycin is enabling immune tolerance meaning a prevention of adas to pegsiticase which is typically immunogenic when administered alone reduced rate of gout flares with sel – in the control cohorts receiving pegsiticase alone within the first month of treatment  of patients reported experiencing a gout flare which is a sudden and severe attack of pain inflammation and tenderness of the joints by comparison only  of patients receiving sel reported a gout flare in the first month of treatment with reports declining further in subsequent months these data also appear to be in contrast with the increased incidence of flares reported in clinical trials involving other urate lowering therapies identified minimum effective dose of sel – a key objective of the phase  trial was to determine a minimum effective monthly dose of the two components of sel ie pegsiticase and svprapamycin through an ascending dose matrix design a majority of the initial patients dosed with  mgkg of pegsiticase in combination with  mgkg of svprapamycin maintained sua control beyond five treatments as a result the company has determined this to be a minimum monthly effective dose of sel additional patients are now being added to this cohort and higher dose levels of svprapamycin are being tested to further determine the dose regimens that may be taken forward into phase  sel generally well tolerated – consistent with the expected reduction in immunogenicity of pegsiticase when svprapamycin doses increase sel has been generally well tolerated at clinically active doses there have been a total of eight serious adverse events saes reported in the trial through june    seven were infusion reactions four of which occurred in the cohorts receiving pegsiticase alone or the lowest dose of svprapamycin and two of which were due to dosing errors one additional sae

cautreels president and chief executive officer location massachusetts usa number of employees  year founded selecta biosciences inc  arsenal street building one watertown ma  usawebsite wwwselectabiocomselecta biosciences has developed nanoparticles that are designed to boost the immune system’s response to invaders it should be fighting and to dampen its response to things it is fighting by mistakethe first application boosting the immune system’s response promises to revolutionize the efficacy and production of vaccines because the nanoparticles are synthetic they can be manufactured much faster than traditional vaccines they will also last longer and will not need to be refrigerated making it easier to roll out vaccine programmes to areas with unreliable electricity supplyselecta’s most advanced product now in human trials is a vaccine against nicotine addiction the vaccine works by inducing antibodies to trap nicotine before it can trigger addiction in effect after the vaccine smoking a cigarette should no longer lead to craving selecta is also at an earlier stage of working on vaccines against malaria and cancervaccines stimulate the immune system to respond to a specific trigger the second application of selecta’s nanoparticles does the opposite training the immune system to tolerize specific triggers this promises a new kind of treatment for allergies and autoimmune diseases such as type  diabetes it could also help in orphan diseases and with transplants where currently the body’s immune response needs to be generally suppressed for the orphan treatment to work or for the transplant not to be rejectedwhile testing will take several years selecta believes its treatments will be quick to manufacture and roll out when efficacy is
