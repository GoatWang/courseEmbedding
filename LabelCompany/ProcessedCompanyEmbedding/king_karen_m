appointment informed her that would not be happening in asking my son questions she asked him if he  liked boys or girls which confused him and was totally uncalled for now lastly they billed my

stars out of  blew me away september   dennis weidus baton rouge age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for shadow over kiriath  ebook this was the final book in the guardian king series karen hancock weaved such an exciting adventureful story that could have been about a biblical king i was so enraptured by the story that i had difficulty stopping at the end of each chapter ive read many fiction books in my time and this series was amazing at grabbing my attention and not letting it leave im very good at foreseeing the next turn in a plot but i was pleasantly surprised with the suspense of the storyline the best part is the biblical allegory that caused me to evaluate spiritual values in myself i would give  stars if i could fabulous series and a must read for fans of cs lewis  tolkien id rate these better than lord of the ringsã®â¬å½ã®â¬å½ã®â¬å½ was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate bevk wi age over

review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate abby ang  stars out of  november   abby ang ok the romance was good and i did like how abramm did learn how to trust god and not himself this book seems darker and heavier than the books before but that doesnt make it any worse and it ends in suspense so the reader will be sure to read the next was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate christian book previewscom  stars out of  february   christian book previewscom hancock winner of eight awards for the first two books of the series plies her great storytelling skills as she carries the reader back into kiriath this book concentrates more on the love story than the other two books of the series though she provides plenty of swashbuckling excitement with esurhite pirates rebellious lords and the vindictive mataio as in her other books she builds on abramms growing faith but he shows a lack of regard about his and madelines reputations that is disappointing at times they do incredibly foolish things although princess carissas love for abramms best friend trap is foreshadowed she disappears for long stretches of the book hancock makes the shadow the forces of evil appear stronger than the great god of light eidon when she allows a master evil spirit called a warhast to indwell some who have accepted the terstan shield which is a symbol that eidon burns into the chest of his converts hancock does not explain how both could occurshadow over kiriath is a good book and an exciting read after the first two books in the series were so superb this one seemed a slight letdown others may disagree fans of kiriath abramm kalladorne and karen hancock will want to grab the nearest copy im looking forward to book four in the series
