asia macro fund made an estimated  percent during the same period in november taking this year’s return to  percent he said dymon joins macro hedgefund peers such as brevan howard asset management and rubicon fund management in turning a political shock into profit brevan howard’s  billion main hedge fund gained  percent in the first  days of november erasing earlier losses this year and rubicon surged almost  percent in the same period to return to profit the november returns for dymon came primarily thanks to bearish bets on various asian currencies including the japanese yen against the greenback said chan the dollar has surged for its biggest monthly gain versus the yen since  on the prospect of presidentelect donald trump’s proposed fiscal stimulus fueling inflation the dollar gained  percent against the japanese currency last month ‘critical component’ “a critical component of the performance was the portfolio construction going into the us presidential election on nov ” chan said “the portfolio was constructed with one express objective enabling dymon asia macro fund to navigate through the anticipated volatility allowing the fund to stay with its highconviction short asian currencies long us dollar positions” danny yong a former goldman sachs group inc and citadel trader started dymon asia macro fund with  million in  with billionaireinvestor paul tudor jones’s tudor investment corp as his first outside backer he is the lone manager of the dymon currency fund yong said he continues to remain bearish on asian currencies and bullish on the dollar a view dymon has held for most of this year as global trade continues to slow while the election of either candidate would have led to different degrees of fiscal expansion the trump victory is expected to result in robust fiscal stimulus and “uscentric policies” he said “this backdrop provides an attractive trading environment for macro strategies as the market digests the full impact of the massive structural changes ahead” yong said citing an uncertain impact on asia and the rest of the world concentrated bets macro hedge funds seek to profit from broad economic trends by trading in markets including currencies interest rates credit stocks and commodities dymon’s currency fund takes more concentrated bets focuses on currencies and gold and has less risk constraint than its bigger macro fund the dymon funds entered the month with bearish positions on asian currencies and bullish bets on gold they used option trades to allow them to minimize losses should the firm’s views turn out wrong while enabling them to make outsize gains should their positions be validated by markets with that they weathered a rally in the yen as the election outcome crystallized and profited when it reversed course the funds also profited from shortterm trading and risk management moves as the markets whipsawed on election day the main macro fund gained  percent on nov  by the time the new york markets closed as the yen rally earlier in the day was erased said chan dymon switched from a bullish bet on yen to a bearish wager between august and september after the bank of japan indicated that it would seek to steepen the yield curve said yong he cited this as evidence of the government’s intent to remedy the adverse effects of its surprise announcement of negative interest rates in january dymon also believed the japanese currency had become too expensive by august after strengthening more than  percent against yuan and the dollar dymon plans to stop taking additional money for the macro fund when its assets hit  billion said chan it will also cease accepting fresh capital for the currency fund when it hits  billion he added bloomberg stay updated with markets news on

was his first outside backer six years later mr yong’s onetime upstart has grown to us billion s billion in assets and delivered the secondbest performance of any large asiabased hedge fund bloomberg markets magazine will report in its february issue from its perch in singapore dymon asia macro returned  per cent in the first  months of last year only the quantedge global fund’s  per cent topped it in asia in bloomberg markets’ annual ranking of funds with us billion or more in assets dymon was also a standout worldwide it came in at no  among all large funds in a bad year for some macro funds which seek to profit from trends in currencies interest rates and equities and commodities markets managers of big asiafocused funds can struggle to deliver consistent gains markets are smaller and less liquid than those in the us and europe and there is a limited pool of talented professionals to run the funds mr yong  who has a resume that includes goldman sachs group has  years of experience trading asian securities dymon asia macro returned  per cent from august  through last october according to a source that compares with a  per cent loss for the hfrx macrocta index which measures macro hedge funds and the socalled commoditytrading advisers that trade futures and forward contracts on commodities financial assets and currencies the dymon fund’s only calendar year loss was for its inaugural five months in  in  dymon asia macro topped all us billion–plus asian funds with a return of more than  per cent after fees “dymon over the years demonstrated strong risk management” says mr stephane pizzo managing partner of singaporebased lotus peak capital which invests in hedge funds “this allows them to limit losses during quiet months while fully participating when the move finally happens” dymon asia macro took advantage of the lull in major market moves during the first half of last year says mr david chan chief executive of dymon asia capital singapore the management firm that oversees us billion of assets including the macro fund he says the fund bought cheap options to benefit from trends it expected to crystallise in later months one of the most profitable bets was on china’s yuan the currency had dropped  per cent against the us dollar in trading outside china in the first four months mr yong says he expected the yuan would rebound and finish the year roughly where it started dymon bought call options which gave it the right to buy the yuan at a specified price during a specified period the currency strengthened  per cent from april to the end of october in trading outside of china “since the global financial crisis market cycles have shortened and trends are often interspersed with violent corrections that make holding on to longterm positions more challenging” says mr yong who is also chief investment officer of dymon asia capital “using options has allowed us to structure trades with compelling riskreward profiles and allows us to generate superior returns when we call the market right” the us federal reserve handed hedge funds last year’s most anticipated trading catalyst the central bank announced in late october that it would end the asset buying that underpinned its third round of quantitative easing the fed’s purchases were designed to boost economic growth and investor confidence unlike some peers who bet treasury bond prices would decline as a result mr yong sought to gain from a stronger us economy by going long on the us dollar against the japanese yen the strategy had two benefits it shielded dymon investors from the largest oneday decline since  in us treasury yields on oct  a drop that reversed in the following days it also allowed dymon to profit from additional stimulus moves and pension reforms mr yong says he expected would lead japan’s currency lower dymon boosted the size of its bet against the yen convinced the japanese economy was running out of steam from aug  the day the secondquarter gross domestic product gdp number was announced through oct  the us dollar strengthened  per cent against japan’s currency it had extended the gain by a further  per cent as of the end of last month after the bank of japan decided to expand the stimulus in late october on nov  the country announced it had slipped back into recession in the third quarter mr yong has lived through plenty of asia’s turmoil in a year career he joined what is now jpmorgan chase  co as a trader on the asian marketsderivatives and fixedincome desk in  just months before the region’s financial crisis

yasmineysphcomsg they run an investment firm managing us billion s billion for major pension funds asset managers and sovereign wealth funds including temasek holdings and their funds have been ranked among the bestperforming hedge funds in the world but up close and personal mr keith tan and mr danny yong both  the founders of dymon asia are still two university buddies who can barely believe their luck anyone else would be happy to crow about how their own genius and hard work helped them build one of singapores most successful homegrown finance firms mr tan and mr yong keep bringing up the importance of luck and gratitude in their success story take mr tan whose parents were vegetable sellers and who grew up playing at the geylang serai wet market he recently participated in a survey on entrepreneurship one of the questions asked him to rank on a scale of one to  what kind of cards he was dealt at birth playing to different strengths we focus on two extreme ends of investing – in our private equity business keith has an indepth understanding of entrepreneurs and individual companies that we invest in while i assess global events and anticipate macroeconomic trends across the world to make topdown macro investments ’’ mr danny yong referring to mr keith tan they are the founders of dymon asia considering my familys humble background maybe most peoples immediate reactions were to put down three or four but mine was a definite  he says  i might not have been given a very good financial head start but since i was young i saw how my parents worked they didnt bring home a huge amount of money but they taught me how with your bare pair of hands and the willingness to work hard you can make a decent and honest living no amount of money could have bought this kind of head start in life and this has guided the way i have approached life since i was young mr yong grew up the youngest of three under the care of a single mother a nurse after his father died when he was  it forged my mindset we were living off my mums salary we got by i didnt feel poor although i felt i was missing a father figure he recalls but my mum always told me not to let anyone look down on me hence i was always very competitive from a young age those early days drilled into my head that i needed to work hard so people wouldnt look down on me that competitive streak was what brought the two friends together at nanyang technological university mr yong says he played basketball and handball for his hall and i played badminton and handball for mine so we started off as rivals where he was the guy that at times contributed to beating my hall at basketball and handball  so i didnt like him as i didnt like to lose but in our second year we ended up taking the same class and we got to know each other my respect for keith grew so much so that before we graduated i told him if one day you start a business and you dont involve me ill punch you after graduation the two pursued separate careers mr yong was a trader at jp morgan goldman sachs and citadel investment asia while mr tans resume includes heading the small and mediumsized enterprise lending team at standard chartered and then later being appointed the branch manager of its shanghai office and a member of standard chartereds china executive committee in  the good friends reunited mr yong and some former colleagues at citadel founded their own hedge fund called abax global capital in hong kong and mr yong immediately seized the opportunity to call upon his friend mr tan in  the two decided to go home to singapore and start their own firm in dymon asia capital and launch what would evolve into todays flagship product the dymon asia macro fund as well as establish a successful private equity business dymon asia private equity we focus on two extreme ends of investing  in our private equity business keith has an indepth understanding of entrepreneurs and individual companies that we invest in while i assess global events and anticipate macroeconomic trends across the world to make topdown macro investments mr yong says we were very very fortunate that paul tudor jones a legend in the hedge fund industry agreed to give us us million seed funding in august  the following month investment bank lehman brothers collapsed sparking off the financial crisis whilst we were unlucky that we launched just as the financial world was melting down we were at the same time very fortunate that we managed to start our hedge fund frankly had the us million seed investment been delayed by even one month it would have been cancelled and hence likely that dymon asia would not be in existence today you must be passionate and good at what you do and work extremely hard but you also need some luck sometimes in order to succeed mr yong adds what is lucky too is that the two friends have managed to strengthen their friendship through the firms highs and lows in january  the fund was negatively impacted from exposure to the swiss franc when the swiss central bank made the unexpected decision to depeg it from the euro after the losses mr yong and mr tan made a choice which they felt was the right thing to do they proactively rebated a portion of the fees they received from their strong performance in  back to their investors for the loss in  investors applauded the decision and many commended the organisation for its alignment of interest with investors which was uncommon in the industry we didnt do it for the praise we just felt it was the right thing to do mr yong says even employees applauded the decision when the company carried out an anonymous survey to gauge staff satisfaction one of the questions asked what made them proud to work for dymon and many cited this particular move as a factor through the ups and downs the firm has chalked up a series of impressive feats last year its dymon asia macro fund was the th best performing fund in the world among funds that have over us billion in assets and fifth within the macro strategy category in  and  this same fund was within the top  performing large hedge funds in the world there are no similar global rankings for private equity but the close to  per cent annual net returns that the business rakes in for clients is likely among the top  per cent in the world for performance the year before that same fund was the  best performer in the world run by a large hedge fund along the way assets under management have ballooned from us million at the firms founding to approximately us billion today besides the dymon asia macro fund and dymon asia private equity fund other funds within the firm include dymon asia ventures and dymon asia manager solutions which was seeded by temasek holdings in  the two friends shared values carry over into their philanthropic work mr tan sits on the main committee of the yellow ribbon fund part of the yellow ribbon project that supports former offenders to reintegrate into society mr yong meanwhile set up a foundation to help children from challenging family backgrounds and the ray of hope initiative a nonprofit organisation that uses crowdfunding to help donors get their money to those who need help with an emphasis on accountability to donors the two are also working on a new try initiative which aims to get organisations to hire more nongraduates even school dropouts as apprentices who can learn on the job and work their way up just three decades ago it was common for nongraduates to work in finance there were many stories of people who started in the mail room but worked their way up to become star traders and legendary investors mr yong says but now its so rare across all industries organisations find it easy to hire graduates with firstclass honours from ivy league universities why look through the haystack for hidden talent again it all boils down to their belief that luck got them to where they are today and wanting to help others achieve the same success mr yong notes honestly how much of what you know today you learnt on the job most people would say over  per cent of their skills were learnt on the job so if you find a bunch of people who are curious hungry to learn driven street smart or have decent eq if you give them an opportunity to learn by throwing them in the deep end could some of them evolve into superstars too we believe that when someone possesses certain personality traits and a strong desire to succeed if given an opportunity to learn on the job many can excel professionally with or without a university degree the requisite traits differ for different industries a version of this article appeared in the print edition of the straits times on may   with the headline luck
