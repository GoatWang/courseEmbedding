pure silver shampoo and conditioner and glancing at the reviews i thought i would share my experience i am  years and have been turning from strawberry blonde to white around my face since my late s color treated for over  years and then just decided it was crazy to be eating organicvegan and then having chemicals saturate my scalp every four weeks my white hair had a brassy look and i decided to switch from another high end hair product to philip kingsley i was sitting in my local bagel shop and a complete stranger approached me and said  your hair is beautiful and from where i am sitting you look like an angel just stunning is this natural i am now committed posted on  by kathleen schell ok but doesnt seem worth the price i dont care for it that much doesnt seem worth the price to me my hair gets clean but doesnt seem much improved and i dont care for the smell  like chemicals i splurged on this because of the glowing reviews but wont buy it again others apparently like it though so maybe its just me  posted on  by carolyn no more grey noticing a few grey hairs here and there was enough to throw me over the edge several highlights left my hair dry and a scalp uncomfortable i finally discovered pk pure silver shampoo and conditioner even my hairdresser has noticed a remarkable difference highlights last longer no more dry hair looking far younger now i love all of pk hair products expensive but worth every penny posted on  by middleaged great product i have naturally very blonde fine hair to which i add highlights to give a bit of body they do tend to go a bit brassy over time this shampoo restores the cool radiance i like it smells gorgeous and leaves my hair glossy and swishy but not lank or limp a very nice product and as ever the quality is so high you only need to use a small amount so it is not as expensive as it appears at all posted on  by sue changes everything i have been using the pure silver shampoo and conditioner for about  months now exclusively i dont color my hair and the texture had changed as its been going silver and was looking dull and frizzy my husband just commented today while looking at the back of my head how really good my hair looks it is extremely soft to the touch easy to style and doesnt have the flyaways that it used to have its quite an investment for shampoo and conditioner i know i did get the elasticizer but dont use it or feel i need it in addition to these two products really but it might have helped kick start the changes having hair thats healthy shiny bouncy and feels thick makes my silver and greys really stand out in a crowd now i use one pump from the large bottles each for rmy long hair and still have a few months before i run out even after i shared some with my mom posted
