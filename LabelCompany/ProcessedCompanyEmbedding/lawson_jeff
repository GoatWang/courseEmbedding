hottest tech ipo explains why hes not concerned about the stock price matt weinberger may    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print twilio ceo jeff lawson at twilio signal  in san franciscotwilioits been a wild ride for twilio the  billion cloud communications company behind 6s hottest tech ipo  after debuting in june 6 at  per share twilios stock soared to a peak of  by september by halloween twilio was down to less than half that early may saw another dip after twilio announced that uber one of its marquee customers was starting to reduce its reliance on the service to send text messages to drivers and passengers by market close on wednesday twilio was trading at around 6 per share thats still  above its ipo price but 6 below its alltime high business insider caught up with twilio ceo and cofounder jeff lawson at the companys annual signal event in san francisco to talk about life postipo and the plan for whats next  in general lawson says that he was and remains unfazed by each dip and pop in twilios stock its tempting to judge twilio by its stock price but a company is much more complicated and multidimensional than that he says you can get very distracted by that number lawson says  dont get distracted lawson says hes impressed that wall streets understands his business which he acknowledges is not as easy for the average person to grok compared to wellknown consumer brands such as facebook or microsoft  twilios service lets developers easily bolt various specialized features onto their apps such as texting phone calling facebook messaging and even fax  i thought the investors hadnt really seen a developerfriendly company like us before says lawson who says that hes pleased overall with the markets reaction  lawson says that his priorities as the ceo of a public company are the same as they were when twilio was privately held keep customers happy and keep the revenue growth going as it marches towards its goal of profitability  twilio ceo jeff lawson on the day of the ipotwiliotwitter and the proof is in the pudding as they say twilio revenues grew  last quarter over the same period in 6 which he says is faster than our peers in the market the company says 6 developers signed up to use twilios service in the last year lawson also hypes the companys efficiency saying that the company burns far less cash than other companies of comparable age and size  long term what matters is running a great business says lawson if thats not what im focused on im doing it wrong whats next at signal twilio unveiled a new set of services called twilio engagement cloud — basically a set of prepackaged code for software developers that makes it much easier to implement commonlydone tasks to use an example from lawson a san francisco laundryondemand startup called rinse used twilios code to quickly build a system into the app so a customer could call their delivery person directly it sounds basic but its actually a really hard problem for any developer who doesnt have the resources of an uber or amazon or google behind them the strategy here says lawson is to make it ever easier to build twilio into your products he says that while the individual pieces of the engagement cloud have been around twilio for a long time this is a fleshing out of the product line such that the company can do more of the work on behalf of developersa banner for communications software provider twilio inc hangs on the facade at the nyse to celebrate the companys ipo in new york citythomson reuters we are trying to build a bigger picture says lawson  and while some wall street analysts worry about twilios competitive position — given that heavyweights like amazon microsoft and google have a habit of entering new markets and muscling out smaller players — lawson notes that twilio has been around longer has deals with phone providers all around the globe and has lots of goodwill among developers weve been investing in our supernetwork around the world says lawson we feel really good about the lead we have  besides as lawson notes amazon and salesforce actually both use twilio technology to power some of the voicebased products they offer to their own customers theyre customers of ours lawson says visit markets insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks etfs indices
