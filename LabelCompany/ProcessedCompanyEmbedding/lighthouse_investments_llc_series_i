you’re part of something new something exciting and something meaningful we live in a time where some fundamental technologies — like artificial intelligence computer vision deep learning and natural language processing — have a chance to make a huge impact on our world and everyday lives and for us one of the most interesting possibilities is how we can apply all of this to the place that matters most our home ourstory the start of something big lighthouse got its start in the computer science labs of stanford where our cto and cofounder hendrik dahlkamp worked on stanley stanford’s pioneering selfdriving car after being on the first team to ever win the darpa grand challenge for autonomous vehicles hendrik continued his work in sebastian thrun’s lab where he met our ceo and cofounder alex teichman an expert in semisupervised learning on d sensors the two computer scientists helped develop multiple technologies that enabled advancements in computer vision and depth perception alex and

the mojave desert ourteam our founders alex teichman — ceo and cofounder while receiving his phd in computer science alex led stanford’s research on selfdriving car perception inventing machine learning techniques that enabled selfdriving cars to learn to recognize objects on their own instead of requiring largescale human annotation intrigued by the potential range of uses for computer vision and artificial intelligence he was inspired to leverage these new technologies for realworld applications in the home alex has an undergrad degree in electrical engineering from the university of pennsylvania and a phd in computer science from stanford university hendrik dahlkamp — cto and cofounder hendrik previously cofounded two companies both acquired by google his work led to the

it possible to understand the motion of objects through space and time enabling highly accurate models that we update continuously and validate with large scale quantitative testing person recognition nextlevel person identification our team of computer vision phds have built models that allow lighthouse to quickly learn the difference between known and unknown faces and d sensing opens the door to advanced algorithms that identify a known person by size shape or movement even when it can’t see a face action recognition action recognition beyond simple gestures using action recognition models

seen the kids running around recently did you see chris with the dog at the front door last week while i was away and if you’re the quiet type you can instead type a brief search  just like youre googling your home halovision any time you go back and review recorded video colorcoded halos make it easy to follow and sort out activity around adults children and pets and they’re just so cool daily recap review the events of the day with one tap timelapse videos automatically skip past periods of inactivity so you can go straight to the action be in the know in less than a minute save and share select download and share lighthouse clips in just a few taps all your cameras in one place easily switch views and search for activity across multiple cameras or multiple homes activity svg icon lighthouseindoorcamera pings ask lighthouse to ping you the moment something important happens  or doesnt happen five seconds to set up endless peace of mind if you dont see the kids by pm on weekdays while im away let me know tell me if you see the kids alone in the garage send me a ping when john gets home today ping me if dana doesnt arrive on saturdays between  and am notify me if you see the kids downstairs between pm and am when the cat jumps on the kitchen table send me a notification alert me if you dont see someone with the dog at the front door between  and pm when im out let me know if no one enters the kitchen between pm and pm rich notifications know exactly what’s going on without even opening the app get a preview of security alerts and pings right from your phone’s lock screen activity feed see the day’s important events such as how long someone’s been home who’s been coming and going the camera being armed and disarmed and security alerts all in one place all systems go with the tricolor led indicator on the camera or a quick check of the app you can instantly check that lighthouse is online recording and streaming communication svg icon

return to lighthouse after bouncing off objects in the environment producing a continuously updating d model of the scene  fundamental to the advanced computer vision that makes the lighthouse experience possible d mapping false alerts gone forever really because lighthouse directly measures the full d structure of the environment we’ve eliminated the false alerts from changing light conditions and shadows that plague all other home cameras deep learning always machine learning we’ve spent over two years building machine learning models that can accurately classify dogs cats children and adults and ignore movement from objects like curtains or fans d sensing makes it possible to understand the motion of objects through space and time enabling highly accurate models that we update continuously and validate with large scale quantitative testing person recognition nextlevel person identification our team of computer vision phds have built models that allow lighthouse to quickly learn the difference between known and unknown faces and d sensing opens the door to advanced algorithms that identify a known person by size shape or movement even when it can’t see a face action recognition action recognition beyond simple gestures using action recognition models trained on the d sensor we’re able to distinguish and alert you to interesting activity in your home like

meaningful we live in a time where some fundamental technologies — like artificial intelligence computer vision deep learning and natural language processing — have a chance to make a huge impact on our world and everyday lives and for us one of the most interesting possibilities is how we can apply all of this to the place that matters most our home ourstory the start of something big lighthouse got its start in the computer science labs of stanford where our cto and cofounder hendrik dahlkamp worked on stanley stanford’s pioneering selfdriving car after being on the first team to ever win the darpa grand challenge for autonomous vehicles hendrik continued his work in sebastian thrun’s lab where he met our ceo and cofounder alex teichman an expert in semisupervised learning on d sensors the two computer scientists helped develop multiple technologies that enabled advancements in computer vision and depth perception alex and hendrik saw a huge opportunity in applying these technologies in transformative ways and lighthouse was born stanley the first autonomous vehicle to complete the mile darpa grand challenge course in the mojave desert ourteam our founders alex teichman — ceo and cofounder while receiving his phd in computer science alex led stanford’s research on selfdriving car perception inventing machine learning techniques that enabled selfdriving cars to learn to recognize objects on their own instead of requiring largescale human annotation intrigued by the potential range of uses for computer vision and artificial intelligence he was inspired to leverage these new technologies for realworld applications in the home alex has an undergrad degree in electrical engineering from the university of pennsylvania and a phd in computer science from stanford university hendrik dahlkamp — cto and cofounder hendrik previously cofounded two companies both acquired by google his work led to the creation of google street view google maps’ turnbyturn
