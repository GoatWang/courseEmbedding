primary purposes of this offering are to enhance our profile and brand recognition create a public market for our shares for the benefit of all shareholders retain talented employees by providing them with equity incentives and obtain additional capital we plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placements as follows • approximately us million for investing in our technology and research and development activities • approximately us million for expanding our sales and marketing activities including marketing programs on the internet television outdoor media and other formats to increase our brand recognition promote nuomicom and jingweicom and promote games on our online games center and • the balance for other general corporate purposes including potential

management however will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering if an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change we may use the proceeds of

holding company we are permitted under prc laws and regulations to provide funding to our prc subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions and to our consolidated affiliated entities only through loans subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements we may extend loans to our prc subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entities or make additional capital contributions to our prc subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures or working capital we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis if at all we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of adss by the selling shareholders the internet industry in china is rapidly evolving and highly competitive we face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business particularly from companies that provide social networking internet communication online games search functions andor other products and services such as tencent inc kaixincom and sina corporation and from social commerce service providers such as meituancom lashoucom and dianpingcom we also compete for online advertising revenues with other websites that sell online advertising services in china in addition we indirectly compete for advertising budgets with traditional advertising media in china such as television and radio stations newspapers and magazines and major outofhome media we may also face potential competition from global social networking service providers that seek to enter the china market we believe that prc domestic social networking websites including us are likely to have a competitive advantage over international competitors entering the china market as these companies so far are likely to lack operational infrastructure in china and content localization experience for the china market and the websites of some global social networking service providers such as facebook are currently not accessible in the prc we compete for advertisers primarily on the basis of size and purchasing power of our user base effectiveness of services in reaching targeted consumers ability to demonstrate marketing results knowledge of our sales force and leadership in our social network services category in social commerce services we compete for merchant partners and deals primarily on the basis of effectiveness of services in generating sales size and purchasing power of our user base and the rate of commission for our services we compete for users and user engagement primarily on the basis of helping users communicate share and have fun on our platform as a result of quality and innovation in our userfacing products as well as brand name and recognition and quality of usergenerated content company description we operate the leading real name social networking internet platform in china as measured by total page views and total user time spent on social networking websites in february  based on data issued in march  by iresearch our platform enables our users to connect and communicate with each other share information and usergenerated content play online games listen to music shop

industry in china to achieve this goal we are focused on providing a highly engaging and interactive platform that promotes connectivity communication and sharing among our users we believe our users are attracted to our large and highly engaged real name community the broad range of rich communication features and functions on our real name social networking internet platform our information and content sharing features and our offering of a variety of online games and other applications and services our platform includes renrencom our main social networking website gamerenrencom our online games center nuomicom our social commerce website and jingweicom our newly launched professional and business social networking service website our renrencom website is one of the largest social networking websites in china as measured by monthly unique visitors in february  based on data issued in march  by iresearch the quality of our user experience is reflected in the continued growth of our user base and their high level of engagement and interactivity on our platform from january  through march  we added an average of approximately two million new activated users per month our users’ high level of engagement with our platform is reflected in the amount of time our users spend on our platform as well as their interactions through it for example from january  through march  our unique login users spent a monthly average of approximately seven hours on our platform and our users collectively produced a daily average of approximately  million pieces of usergenerated content including approximately three million photos and  million status updates our market leadership stems from our track record of innovation and our pioneering role in china’s social networking service industry we believe many features and functions that we introduced to the china market have improved the quality of our user experience and have subsequently become standard throughout the industry for example we believe renrencom was the first major social networking website in china to offer services like our renren open platform program and renren connect program our renren open platform program allows users to access high quality applications from thirdparty developers through our open application programming interface our renren connect program allows our users to sign in and share information and content from over  renren connect partner websites in addition in order to meet chinese users’ needs and preferences for instant notification and real time communication we created our renren desktop client application which we believe is unique among major global social networking websites this application provides real time news feed updates while also facilitating instant messaging among our users we believe a key driver of our longterm success is the continued rapid introduction of new services and features that can leverage our existing platform and large user base for example the size of our existing renrencom user base allowed us to launch and quickly expand our social commerce services on nuomicom whose first social commerce offer in june  resulted in purchases of over  pairs of movie tickets for a single movie theater complex in beijing over  of nuomicom’s users are renrencom users nuomicom became a leading social commerce website in china for  according to a report published in january  by china ebusiness research center more recently we launched jingweicom a professional and business social networking service website to further leverage our existing user base we currently generate revenues from online advertising and internet value added services or ivas our ivas revenues are comprised of online games revenues and other ivas revenues which include revenues we earn from merchants who offer services and products on nuomicom paid applications on our renren open platform program and vip memberships our total net revenues increased
