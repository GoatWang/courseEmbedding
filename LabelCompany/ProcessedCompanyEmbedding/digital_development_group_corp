distribution capability across multiple platforms using existing internet protocol ip services providing increased monetization opportunities and greater control over distribution “digidev’s vision offers a simplified online customer management system enabling content providers direct access to consumers and revenues” joe q bretz digidev president digidev is focused on the opportunity presented

builtin internet connectivity these devices piggyback on existing network services in consumers homes and offices pulls content from the internet and delivers it to the consumers tv set or other display unit it’s often referred to as “overthetop” because the services ride “on top” of the service users already have and doesn’t require any business or technology affiliations or additional subscriptions with their network provider this is a very important distinction to be made as the isp in effect is providing the pipeline  distribution channel for the content but does not interfere with or participate in the actual delivery rather the isp simply transports ip packets this is a different business proposition than offering videoondemand vod services where the isp which may be a
