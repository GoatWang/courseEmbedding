over  employees with offices in london oxford new york san francisco hong kong shanghai sydney tokyo and zurich investment philosophy winton’s investment solutions are based on the belief that profitable investment opportunities can be identified through the application of advanced statistical and pattern recognition techniques to large datasets such systems employ forecasts or signals that are typically weak and barely distinguishable from noise consequently winton focuses much of its efforts on establishing the statistical significance of signals and devising appropriate risk and cost controls winton believes more reliable investment decisions can be made using statistical inference from empirical evidence than deductive reasoning from economic axioms investment systems wintons investment systems are the product of nearly two decades of applying science technology and statistical research to investment management the systems combine forecasts of returns volatilities and
