references  external links overviewedit deming received a bs in electrical engineering from the university of wyoming at laramie  an ms from the university of colorado  and a phd from yale university  both graduate degrees were in mathematics and physics he had an internship at western electrics hawthorne works in cicero illinois while studying at yale he later worked at the us department of agriculture and the census department while working under gen douglas macarthur as a census consultant to the japanese government he was asked to teach a short seminar on statistical process control methods to members of the radio corps at the invitation of sarasohn during this visit he was contacted by juse the japanese union of scientists and engineers to talk directly to japanese business leaders not about statistical process control but about his theories of management returning to japan for many years to consult later he became a professor at new york university while engaged as an independent consultant in washington dc deming was the author of quality productivity and competitive position out of the crisis – and the new economics for industry government education  and books on statistics and sampling deming played the flute and drums and composed music throughout his life including sacred choral compositions and an arrangement of the star spangled banner in  he founded the w edwards deming institute in washington dc where the deming collection at the us library of congress includes an extensive audiotape and videotape archive the aim of the institute is to foster understanding of the deming system of profound knowledge to advance commerce prosperity and peace demings teachings and philosophy are clearly illustrated by examining the results they produced after they were adopted by japanese industry as the following example shows ford motor company was simultaneously manufacturing a car model with transmissions made in japan and the united states soon after the car model was on the marketwhen ford customers were requesting the model with japanese transmission over the usmade transmission and they were willing to wait for the japanese model as both transmissions were made to the same specifications ford engineers could not understand the customer preference for the model with japanese transmission finally ford engineers decided to take apart the two different transmissions the americanmade car parts were all within specified tolerance levels on the other hand the japanese car parts were virtually identical to each other and much closer to the nominal values for the parts—eg if a part was supposed to be one foot long plus or minus  of an inch—then the japanese parts were all within  of an inch less variation this made the japanese cars run more smoothly and customers experienced fewer problems familyedit born in sioux city iowa william edwards deming was raised in polk city iowa on his grandfather henry coffin edwardss chicken farm then later on a acre  ha farm purchased by his father in powell wyoming he was the son of william albert deming and pluma irene edwards his parents were well educated and emphasized the importance of education to their children pluma had studied in san francisco and was a musician william albert had studied mathematics and law he was a direct descendant of john deming – an early puritan settler and original patentee of the connecticut colony and honor treat the daughter of richard treat – an early new england settler deputy to the connecticut legislature and also a patentee of the royal charter of connecticut  deming married agnes bell in  she died in  a little more than a year after they had adopted a daughter dorothy deming made use of various private homes to help raise the infant

columbia universitys graduate school of business – he also was a consultant for private business in  deming was introduced to walter a shewhart of the bell telephone laboratories by ch kunsman of the united states department of agriculture usda deming found great inspiration in the work of shewhart the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related technical tool of the control chart as deming began to move toward the application of statistical methods to industrial production and management shewharts idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to demings theory of management deming saw that these ideas could be applied not only to manufacturing processes but also to the processes by which enterprises are led and managed this key insight made possible his enormous influence on the economics of the industrialized world after  biologist and statistician ronald fisher in  he studied under sir ronald fisher and jerzy neyman at university college london england deming edited a series of lectures delivered by shewhart at usda statistical method from the viewpoint of quality control into a book published in  one reason he learned so much from shewhart deming remarked in a videotaped interview was that while brilliant shewhart had an uncanny ability to make things difficult deming thus spent a great deal of time both copying shewharts ideas and devising ways to present them with his own twist deming developed the sampling techniques that were used for the first time during the  us census formulating the demingstephan algorithm for iterative proportional fitting in the process during world war ii deming was a member of the fiveman emergency technical committee he worked with hf dodge ag ashcroft leslie e simon re wareham and john gaillard in the compilation of the american war standards american standards association z– published in  and taught statistical process control spc techniques to workers engaged in wartime

work in japanedit in  deming was involved in early planning for the  japanese census the allied powers were occupying japan and he was asked by the united states department of the army to assist with the census he was brought over at the behest of general douglas macarthur who grew frustrated at being unable to complete so much as a phone call without the line going dead due to japans shattered postwar economy while in japan his expertise in quality control techniques combined with his involvement in japanese society brought him an invitation from the japanese union of scientists and engineers juse juse members had studied shewharts techniques and as part of japans reconstruction efforts they sought an expert to teach statistical control from june–august  deming trained hundreds of engineers managers and scholars in statistical process control spc and concepts of quality he also conducted at least one session for top management including top japanese industrialists of the likes of akio morita the cofounder of sony corp demings message to japans chief executives was that improving quality would reduce expenses while increasing productivity and market share perhaps the best known of these management lectures was delivered at the mt hakone conference center in august  a number of japanese manufacturers applied his techniques widely and experienced heretofore unheardof levels of quality and productivity the improved quality combined with the lowered cost created new international demand for japanese products deming declined to receive royalties from the transcripts of his  lectures so juses board of directors established the deming prize december  to repay him for his friendship and kindness within japan the deming prize continues to exert considerable influence on the disciplines of quality control and quality management honorsedit in  the prime minister of japan nobusuke kishi acting on behalf of emperor hirohito awarded deming japans

and unrecognized in his country of origin and work in  he was featured prominently in an nbc tv documentary titled if japan can why cant we about the increasing industrial competition the united states was facing from japan as a result of the broadcast demand for his services increased dramatically and deming continued consulting for industry throughout the world until his death at the age of
