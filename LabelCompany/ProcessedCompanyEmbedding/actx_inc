genomics cells and dna dna inheritance categories of genetic testing genetics is the science of heredity the field of genetics studies how different traits are passed down in a family these traits define how you look the types of diseases you may be prone to and what types of medications will work best for you these traits are typically passed down through a family which is why you tend to look more like your relatives than someone you aren’t related to it’s also why some diseases like type  diabetes certain types of cancer or heart disease tend to run in families everything in genetics starts out with your deoxyribonucleic acid or dna dna is a long string of four different molecules called nucleotides adenine cytosine guanine and thymine each of the four nucleotides is referred to as a single letter code a c g or t the sequence or order of these nucleotides along the length of the dna determines who you are – biologically speaking if you pick two people randomly from the population the majority of their dna sequence will be exactly the same two different people share around  of their dna sequence but those differences that we have are important – they are what distinguish you from other people they are what cause some of us to have brown eyes and others to have blue eyes some to have curly hair straight hair or no hair at all as we get older some of these differences can increase or decrease our risk for certain diseases others can affect how we respond to different medications these differences in the sequence of our dna from one person to another are called variants and they are the basis of our genetic health and ancestry information services patient physician healthcare provider ehr partner practice health systems information actx service why

decision supportour genomic decision support focuses only on actionable conditions based on published evidence comprehensive genomic coverage avoid the challenges of trying to internally develop a system some health systems consider integrating genomics into their ehr via an internally developed project while internal projects can demonstrate the potential of genomic decision support they face serious challenges at scale the reason is that there is typically no place to store large sets of genetic data in the ehr and existing ehr decision support rule systems do not adapt well to the complexity of genomics these two factors lead to a very limited internal genomic decision support implementations that are difficult to maintain even in organizations with substantial technical and genetic capabilities examples of challenges include writing maintaining and testing hundreds of logically complex alerts storing and analyzing patient genetic data sets which can be as large as m variants per patient performance and computer resource issues human capital costs an internal project requires many hours from team members and consultants including it personnel project managers physicians geneticists pharmd’s etc scalability new alerts or changes to existing alerts need to be developed continuously as our knowledge advances computer resources can be strained as the genetic
