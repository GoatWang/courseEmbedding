experience in design and user experience design about  sharkreach  corporate select page about sharkreach a ‘millennial’ media company our mission is to create the world’s first media company built from the ground up to be able to reach the ever elusive millennial demographic a company that realizes that traditional marketing campaigns alone no longer drive the results that advertisers and big brands expect sharkreach understands  that this “trend” will continue to cause traditional  media companies to lose ground with each new generation as they watch less television spend more of their lives on their mobile devices in essence we are a media company designed for the new “digital world” and an audience that no longer trusts a brand’s advertising unless it’s being  influenced by someone that they follow this is why we are the firstever influencer owned public media company and this is what separates us from other media companies and what will ensure our growth for the future we will accomplish this with a two pronged bottom up and  top down approach to developing and acquiring technology platforms and companies that will allow us to reach this goal from the bottom up we intend to create a suite of products that will create a path for building better  influencers to be ranked rated  and rewarded for performance and conversions in order to inspire them to work towards being  offered the opportunity to be an owner of sharkreach and to become part of our networks accumulative reach then from the top down we will create a suite of products for brands to monetize the reach of  the shark reach influencer owned network by allowing them to create better campaigns and track them so that they have a  vehicle for monetizing the engaged audience that  each of our influencers  brings to the network platform agnostic and always first with brand safe social media activations followed by original ip  ultimately complete monetization of all appropriate talent assets we will accomplish this through establishing strong authentic talent direct relationships and acquiring bestofbreed companies within the digital media space in order to execute optimized monetization of these assets team  sharkreach  corporate select page team leadership steve smith ceo previous to founding shark reach steve worked for more than  years in the media business in senior

that we had a number of the sons of founding nwa members go to the places in the movie in compton that only they could access because they are family we took a simple thing where we have hiphop talent do social posts about a hiphop movie our process is understanding what the client wants and then leveraging our close direct working relationship with the talent to conceptualize content that… will be effective to capture the intended audience” this compton campaign was so effective that javon frazier professor of strategic marketing at ucla has based an entire semester on this campaign as to the

acquisitions unique approach to influencer marketing worthy micro cap mentionsaccesswirefebruary  reblogsharetweetsharedelray beach fl  accesswire  february    in recent years millennials have begun to enter the marketplace as entrepreneurs business persons and investors and they have quickly discovered that one of the greatest challenges to building a successful brand is marketing enter a new digitallybased approach to reaching consumers called influencer marketing which focuses heavily on social media and other networking channels in the digital landscape to foster what are called brand influencers influencer marketing uses brand influencers usually an online celebrity or company with a large amount of sway over its digital followers to promote particular brands on social media channels like instagram snapchat and twittersharkreach inc shrk established itself last year as a company for investors to watch by becoming one of the leaders in this new field through its wildly successful campaign for the film straight outta compton popular movie studio universal employed sharkreach with the expectation that the companys efforts would bolster the films online presence by  million impressions instead sharkreach exceeded projections by over  creating over  million impressions for the film which remained the top grossing film at the box office for three weeksas sharkreach continues to grow thanks to straight outta compton and other successful influencer marketing campaigns the companys executive board has begun to add relevant new pieces on tuesday they announced that erik pilkington has joined the companys board of directors mr pilkington previously served for ibm watson as managing director of digital strategy as well as at mccann as global chief digital officer in his current position for bcg digital ventures he is leading technologists designers and strategists to create revenue for the fortune  demonstrating his strong background connecting digital

in digital marketing and web development for over  years on teams that developed for sony toyota and other large corporations additionally svp of sales steve moriya brings more than  years of media advertising and content production experience to the sharkreach teamone of the keys to sharkreachs quick success  the company was founded in   is that the same talented individuals working as brand influencers for sharkreach also own a stake in the company sharkreach proudly promotes the fact that it retains an influencerowner network of over  individuals a number that is constantly increasing as exposure to both sharkreach and the concept of influencer marketing grows exponentiallyin fact projected revenues for sharkreach are expected to increase  by  to  million however with the potential for more viral influencer marketing campaigns on the companys horizon that number may very well prove to be a conservative estimate the vast majority of digitallybased companies engaged in marketing have stated that they currently employ or plan to employ influencer marketing techniques in their campaigns and as the trend of influencer marketing takes off sharkreachs potential network of brand influencers should continue to grow expanding the companys reach revenues and overall market sharemost recently sharkreach reached an agreement to acquire the mobile media lab with estimated revenues of  million under the terms of the agreement sharkreach will acquire  of the mobile media lab llc for cash and stock in the company closing is scheduled to take place on or before february   details of the transaction will be released in an upcoming k filingwith only a handful of companies currently engaged in influencer marketing strategies to the same extent as sharkreach and none of them
