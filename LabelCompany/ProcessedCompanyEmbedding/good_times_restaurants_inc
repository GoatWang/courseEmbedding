inc nas gtim today announced it is rolling out a new chicken platform in february and march based on springer mountain farms antibioticfree hormonefree responsibly raised chicken tenderloins that will be hand breaded daily in each of its restaurants the company said that the move will make good times the only quick service restaurant in its market that serves all natural responsibly raised beef and chicken that is hormone free antibiotic free with no pesticides or animal byproducts in the feedcommenting on the introduction president  ceo boyd hoback said for years we have used coleman and meyer ranch all natural beef and well now be able to offer a true all natural chicken with the springer mountain farms product which we believe is the highest quality available in the market all natural by itself has become so overused as to be rendered somewhat meaningless and we are committed to offering a true natural product with protocols that ensure no hormones no antibiotics no pesticides or animal byproducts in the feed and responsible practices for animal welfare and environmental impact which both meyer ranch beef and springer mountain farms rigorously followthe company reported that the new chicken platform has been in test for the past several months and has yielded substantially increased chicken sales as a percentage of its total sales at those test restaurants hoback added its taken quite a bit of refinement by our operations team for us to deliver the quality and consistency we need by hand breading in each restaurant but the customer response has been overwhelmingly positive it is a strategic move that aligns with our brand position to offer fresh all natural handcrafted quality and helps to continue to differentiate us from the larger qsr competitors we plan to support the product introduction with television advertising and extensive sampling to generate trial and awarenessmeyer ranch beef is the only major beef brand that has earned both the certified humane designation for its animal husbandry processes and the american culinary federations seal of approval for superior quality the cattle are fed a vegetarian diet of grasses and grains and never includes hormones or antibiotics meyer also verifies the origins of its cattle and ensures they are born raised fed and processed solely in the united statesspringer mountain farms chicken is the first poultry company in the world to be american humane certified by the american humane association their chickens are not only  all natural with no steroids or hormones but also are produced with

antibiotic free were committed to using only the best ingredients no bull scroll to see our food philosophy spicy not pricey  breakfast burritos with green chile check em out what is natural anyways natural isnt new natural this natural that its a term youre probably starting to hear pretty frequently but one that doesnt often get explained so what exactly does it mean to be natural is that feed vegan yes we started in boulder so our animals embraced their inner hippy all of our suppliers use high grade vegetarian feed and have certifications that are third party verified to ensure the best diets possible absolutely no animal byproducts are used in their diets but we think our cows would look great in flowered headbands we prefer our animals drugfree this means they are never ever fed any antibiotics steroids or added hormones think of them as teetotalers or fans of nancy reagan’s “just say no to drugs” campaign so you are clear the fda allows the usage of steroids and added hormones in the raising of beef however the fda prevents the usage of steroids and added hormones in the raising of chicken so if you see that as an added “feature” know that they aren’t doing anything above and beyond the minimum requirements some companies also use antibiotics up to a certain point in the animal’s life cycle and then stop claiming to be antibioticfree not our suppliers we believe in transparency and never ever giving the animals antibiotics  of all antibiotics sold in the us are for use on livestock and poultry not humans and the majority of those antibiotics are not even given to animals who are sick the purpose is to use them as a substitute for healthier living conditions and to make chickens and cows grow faster we prefer naturally developed animals not big green hulk ones no jokes here we just want to make sure that our animals are raised in an environment with the strictest humane standards looking out for their wellbeing includes low stress conditions and handling spacious living environment protection from the elements and socialization we do everything short of tucking them in at night better bacon why is this important apple had just released itunes justin timberlake went solo rip n’sync flip phones were the height of style kelly clarkson was crowned american idol the terminator was elected governator it all started with our burgers and we made it our goal to keep it going with our chicken as well today we can proudly say that we have achieved that goal our burgers are only made from meyer allnatural angus beef thats been humanely raised on a strict vegetarian diet with no steroids growth hormones or antibiotics ever skipping the steroids growth hormones and antibiotics allows the animals to mature slowly for optimal tenderness and marbling all of their cattle is humanelyraised on small to midsized family farms the company developed the meyer natural foods humanely handled program to ensure maximum benefit for the cattle this program is a usda fsis approved third party certification process meyer natural angus verifies the source and age of all their cattle to ensure they are born raised fed and processed in accordance with the full requirements of the program and only in the usa learn more we went all the way to springer mountain farms in the blue ridge mountains to bring you our handbreaded allnatural responsiblyraised antibioticfree chicken yes that’s a mouthful a tasty mouthful springer mountain farms is the first chicken farm to earn the american humane society certification that’s why their chickens are fed a pesticide free vegetarian diet of corn and soybean without the use of antibiotics growth stimulants or hormones or animal byproducts  of the corn and soybean that springer mountain farms uses is grown right here in the united states they do not import any ingredients from other countries the corn and soybean meal is extensively tested onsite in their usda certified laboratory not only for nutrient value energy protein minerals and amino acids but also for numerous quality standards such as molds moisture grade of product and pesticide contamination they are one of the few
