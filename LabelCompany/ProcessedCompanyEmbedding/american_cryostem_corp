matched differentiated cell lines such as osteogenic chondrogenic and adipogenic among others contract manufacturing clients may choose master atcell samples which may be reserved by the company on a project specific basis clients may request specific stem cell demographic characteristics such as age sex medical history and ethnic backgrounds which will be sourced processed and stored for the
