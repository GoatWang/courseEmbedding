the mighty haag circus according to the bill sterns sports newsreel broadcast on september   on which james appeared he was saved from being trampled at the age of  by his mothers horse after performing with the horse by the age of  he was taking trumpet lessons from his father who placed him on a strict daily practice schedule each day james was given one page to learn from the arbans book and was not allowed to pursue any other pastime until he had learned that particular page careeredit in  his family settled in beaumont texas it was here in the early s that james began playing in local dance bands when just  years of age james played regularly with herman waldmans band and at one performance was noticed by nationally popular ben pollack in  he joined pollacks band but at the start of  left to join benny goodmans orchestra where he stayed through  he was nicknamed the hawk early in his career for his ability to sightread a common joke was that if a fly landed on his written music harry james would play it his low range had a warmth associated with the cornet and even the flugelhorn but this sound was underrecorded in favor of james brilliant high register with financial backing from goodman in january  james debuted his own big band in philadelphia pennsylvania but it didnt click until  when he added a string section this big band became known as harry james and his music makers his hit you made me love you was in the top  during the week of december   he and his band were featured in three films private buckaroo two girls and a sailor and

picture my dog skip  his music is also featured in the woody allen film hannah and her sisters james recorded many popular records and appeared in many hollywood movies musical style and imageedit influencesedit with jamess childhood spent as a musician in a traveling circus he picked up a flamboyant style that utilized such techniques as heavy vibrato half valve and lip glissandi valve and lip trills and valve tremolos these techniques were popular at the time in what some have called a hot jazz style with jamess idol louis armstrong providing an example of one who used these techniques but they later fell out of favor in the s with the advent of cool jazz jamess father instituted a rigorous regime of practice for james as a child and this allowed james to achieve an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range fingering and tonguing growing up in the south james was also exposed to blues music which had an influence on his style as james explained i was brought up in texas with the blues – when i was eleven or twelve years old down in what they call barbecue row i used to sit in with the guys that had the broken bottlenecks on their guitars playing the blues thats all we knew louis armstrong after hearing harry james solo on several numbers while at a benny goodman onenighter with his friend lionel hampton exclaimed to hampton in the vernacular of the time that white boy – he plays like a jig move towards popedit after james left benny goodmans band in  to form his own band he soon found that leading a commercially viable musical group required a broader set of skills than those needed to be a gifted musician playing in someone elses band the james band ran into financial trouble and it became increasingly difficult for james to make payroll and keep the band together in  james lost his contract with columbia records he returned in  and frank sinatra left the band that january it was not long after this that james made a pivotal decision he would adopt a sweeter style that added strings to the band and the band would deliver tunes that were in more of a pop vein and less true to its jazz roots from a commercial standpoint the decision paid off — james soon enjoyed a string of chart topping hits that provided commercial success for him and his band indeed a us treasury report released in  listed harry james and betty grable as the highestpaid couple in the nation what worked well commercially with the public however had the opposite effect on those in the circle of jazz critics dan morgenstern the respected critic and director of the institute of jazz studies called the  release of you made me love you the record that the jazz critics never forgave harry james for recording with james continuing to employ his hot jazz style on pop hits through the s his playing was often labeled as schmaltzy and dismissed by the critics though radio discs from this period reveal jamess continued commitment to jazz a variety of modern arrangements from neal hefti frank devenport johnny richards and jimmy mundy often inspired his musicians and as bop surpassed swing by the late s james was surprisingly open to its influence refocusededit after coasting through the mids james made a complete reevaluation of where he was heading in his musical career count basie provided the impetus by making a significant comeback with his newly formed  men swinging band and james wanted a band with a decided basie flavor james signed with capitol records in  and two years later after releasing new studio versions of many of his previously released songs from columbia james recorded ten new tracks for an album entitled wild about harry this album was the first in a series released on capitol and continuing later on mgm representative of the basie style that james adopted during this period with some of the arrangements provided by former basie saxophonist and arranger ernie wilkins whom james hired for his own band even after his return to more jazzoriented releases in the late s and into the s james never completely regained favor with the jazz critics during his lifetime more recent reissues however such as capitols disc set the capitol vaults jazz series gene krupa and harry james in  have prompted new more favorable analyses of jamess work in  marc myers of jazzwax commented jamess band of the mids was more modern than most of the majors and in  he led one of the finest bands of the year and on jamess releases from – myers noted the james band during this period has been eclipsed by bands led by basie maynard ferguson and stan kenton while each served up its own brand of magnificence james produced more consistently brilliant tracks than the others virtually everything james recorded during this period was an uncompromising swinging gem response to the criticsedit while in london harry james did an interview with the english jazz critic steve voce when voce asked him if the biggest audience was for the commercial numbers he had recorded he visibly bristled james answered that would depend on for whom you are playing if youre playing for a jazz audience im pretty sure that some of the jazz things we do would be a lot more popular than sleepy lagoon and if were playing at a country club or playing vegas in which we have many many types of people then im sure that sleepy lagoon would be more popular at that particular time but i really get bugged about these people talking about commercial tunes because to me if youre gonna be commercial youre gonna stand on your head and make funny noises and do idiotic things i dont think weve ever recorded or played one tune that i didnt particularly love to play otherwise i wouldnt play it personal lifeedit james was married three times he married singer louise tobin on may   and they had two children they divorced in  that same year he married actress betty grable they had two

performing with the horse by the age of  he was taking trumpet lessons from his father who placed him on a strict daily practice schedule each day james was given one page to learn from the arbans book and was not allowed to pursue any other pastime until he had learned that particular page careeredit in  his family settled in beaumont texas it was here in the early s that james began playing in local dance bands when just  years of age james played regularly with herman waldmans band and at one performance was noticed by nationally popular ben pollack in  he joined pollacks band but at the start of  left to join benny goodmans orchestra where he stayed through  he was nicknamed the hawk early in his career for his ability to sightread a common joke was that if a fly landed on his

picture my dog skip  his music is also featured in the woody allen film hannah and her sisters james recorded many popular records and appeared in many hollywood movies musical style and imageedit influencesedit with jamess childhood spent as a musician in a traveling circus he picked up a flamboyant style that utilized such techniques as heavy vibrato half valve and lip glissandi valve and lip trills and valve tremolos these techniques were popular at the time in what some have called a hot jazz style with jamess idol louis armstrong providing an example of one who used these techniques but they later fell out of favor in the s with the advent of cool jazz jamess father instituted a rigorous regime of practice for james as a child and this allowed james to achieve an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range fingering and tonguing growing up in the south james was also exposed to blues music which had an influence on his style as james explained i was brought up in texas with the blues – when i was eleven or twelve years old down in what they call barbecue row i used to sit in with the guys that had the broken bottlenecks on their guitars playing the blues thats all we knew louis armstrong after hearing harry james solo on several numbers while at a benny goodman onenighter with his friend lionel hampton exclaimed to hampton in the vernacular of the time that white boy – he plays like a jig move towards popedit after james left benny goodmans band in  to form his own band he soon found that leading a commercially viable musical group required a broader set of skills than those needed to be a gifted musician playing in someone elses band the james band ran into financial trouble and it became increasingly difficult for james to make payroll and keep the band together in  james lost his contract with columbia records he returned in  and frank sinatra left the band that january it was not long after this that james made a pivotal decision he would adopt a sweeter style that added strings to the band and the band would deliver tunes that were in more of a pop vein and less true to its jazz roots from a commercial standpoint the decision paid off — james soon enjoyed a string of chart topping hits that provided commercial success for him and his band indeed a us treasury report released in  listed harry james and betty grable as the highestpaid couple in the nation what worked well commercially with the public however had the opposite effect on those in the circle of jazz critics dan morgenstern the respected critic and director of the institute of jazz studies called the  release of you made me love you the record that the jazz critics never forgave harry james for recording with james continuing to employ his hot jazz style on pop hits through the s his playing was often labeled as schmaltzy and dismissed by the critics though radio discs from this period reveal jamess continued commitment to jazz a variety of modern arrangements from neal hefti frank devenport johnny richards and jimmy mundy often inspired his musicians and as bop surpassed swing by the late s james was surprisingly open to its influence refocusededit after coasting through the mids james made a complete reevaluation of where he was heading in his musical career count basie provided the impetus by making a significant comeback with his newly formed  men swinging band and james wanted a band with a decided basie flavor james signed with capitol records in  and two years later after releasing new studio versions of many of his previously released songs from columbia james recorded ten new tracks for an album entitled wild about harry this album was the first in a series released on capitol and continuing later on mgm representative of the basie style that james adopted during this period with some of the arrangements provided by former basie saxophonist and arranger ernie wilkins whom james hired for his own band even after his return to more jazzoriented releases in the late s and into the s james never completely regained favor with the jazz critics during his lifetime more recent reissues however such as capitols disc set the capitol vaults jazz series gene krupa and harry james in  have prompted new more favorable analyses of jamess work in  marc myers of jazzwax commented jamess band of the mids was more modern than most of the majors and in  he led one of the finest bands of the year and on jamess releases from – myers noted the james band during this period has been eclipsed by bands led by basie maynard ferguson and stan kenton while each served up its own brand of magnificence james produced more consistently brilliant tracks than the others virtually everything james recorded during this period was an uncompromising swinging gem response to the criticsedit while in london harry james did an interview with the english jazz critic steve voce when voce asked him if the biggest audience was for the commercial numbers he had recorded he visibly bristled james answered that would depend on for whom you are playing if youre playing for a jazz audience im pretty sure that some of the jazz things we do would be a lot more popular than sleepy lagoon and if were playing at a country club or playing vegas in which we have many many types of people then im sure that sleepy lagoon would be more popular at that particular time but i really get bugged about these people talking about commercial tunes because to me if youre gonna be commercial youre gonna stand on your head and make funny noises and do idiotic things i dont think weve ever recorded or played one tune that i didnt particularly love to play otherwise i wouldnt play

others virtually everything james recorded during this period was an uncompromising swinging gem response to the criticsedit while in london harry james did an interview with the english jazz critic steve voce when voce asked him if the biggest audience was for the commercial numbers he had recorded he visibly bristled james answered that would depend on for whom you are playing if youre playing for a jazz audience im pretty sure that some of the jazz things we do would be a lot more popular than sleepy lagoon and if were playing at a country club or playing vegas in which we have many many types of people then im sure that sleepy lagoon would be more popular at that particular time but i really get bugged about these people talking about commercial tunes because to me if youre gonna be commercial youre gonna stand on your head and make funny noises and do idiotic things i dont think weve ever recorded or played one tune that i didnt particularly love to play otherwise i wouldnt play

they later fell out of favor in the s with the advent of cool jazz jamess father instituted a rigorous regime of practice for james as a child and this allowed james to achieve an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range fingering and tonguing growing up in the south james was also exposed to blues music which had an influence on his style as james explained i was brought up in texas with the blues – when i was eleven or twelve years old down in what they call barbecue row i used to sit in with the guys that had the broken bottlenecks on their

they later fell out of favor in the s with the advent of cool jazz jamess father instituted a rigorous regime of practice for james as a child and this allowed james to achieve an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range fingering and tonguing growing up in the south james was also exposed to blues music which had an influence on his style as james

james continuing to employ his hot jazz style on pop hits through the s his playing was often labeled as schmaltzy and dismissed by the critics though radio discs from this period reveal jamess continued commitment to jazz a variety of modern arrangements from neal hefti frank devenport johnny richards and jimmy mundy often inspired his musicians and as bop surpassed swing by the late s james was surprisingly open to its influence refocusededit after coasting through the mids james made a complete reevaluation of where he was heading in his musical career count basie provided the

others virtually everything james recorded during this period was an uncompromising swinging gem response to the criticsedit while in london harry james did an interview with the english jazz critic steve voce when voce asked him if the biggest audience was for the commercial numbers he had recorded he visibly bristled james answered that would depend on for whom you are playing if youre playing for a jazz audience im pretty sure that some of the jazz things we do would be a lot more popular than sleepy lagoon and if were playing at a country club or playing vegas in which we have many many types of people then im sure that sleepy lagoon would be more popular at that particular time but i really get bugged about these people talking about commercial tunes because to me if youre gonna be commercial youre gonna stand on your head and make funny noises and do idiotic things i dont think weve ever recorded or played one tune that i didnt particularly love to play otherwise i wouldnt play

the mighty haag circus according to the bill sterns sports newsreel broadcast on september   on which james appeared he was saved from being trampled at the age of  by his mothers horse after performing with the horse by the age of  he was taking trumpet lessons from his father who placed him on a strict daily practice schedule each day james was given one page to learn from the arbans book and was not allowed to pursue any other pastime until he had learned that particular page careeredit in  his family settled in beaumont texas it was here in the early s that james began playing in local dance bands when just  years of age james played regularly with herman waldmans band and at one performance was noticed by nationally popular ben pollack in  he joined pollacks band but at the start of  left to join benny goodmans orchestra where he stayed through  he was nicknamed the hawk early in his career for his ability to sightread a common joke was that if a fly landed on his written music harry james would play it his low range had a warmth associated with the cornet and even the flugelhorn but this sound was underrecorded in favor of james brilliant high register with financial backing from goodman in january  james debuted his own big band in philadelphia pennsylvania but it didnt click until  when he added a string section this big band became known as harry james and his music makers his hit you made me love you was in the top  during the week of december   he and his band were featured in three films private buckaroo two girls and a sailor and springtime in the rockies he toured with the band into the s and to this day the harry james orchestra still exists now led by fred radke bandleaderedit his was the first name band to employ vocalist frank sinatra in  for  a week james signed sinatra to a oneyear contract of which sinatra worked seven months before leaving to sing for tommy dorsey he wanted to change sinatras name to frankie satin but sinatra refused his later band included drummer buddy rich his featured vocalist was helen forrest johnny macafee was featured on the sax and vocals and corky corcoran was a youthful sax prodigy radioedit his orchestra succeeded glenn millers on a program sponsored by chesterfield cigarettes in  when miller disbanded his orchestra to enter the army in  james and his orchestra had a summer replacement program for danny kayes program on cbs he also led the orchestra for call for music which was broadcast on cbs february    april   and on nbc april    june   filmedit he played trumpet in the  film young man with a horn dubbing kirk douglas in the album from that movie he backed doris day and the album charted at  jamess recording of im beginning to see the light appears in the motion picture my dog skip  his music is also featured in the woody allen film hannah and her sisters james recorded many popular records and appeared in many hollywood movies musical style and imageedit influencesedit with jamess childhood spent as a musician in a traveling circus he picked up a flamboyant style that utilized such techniques as heavy vibrato half valve and lip glissandi valve and lip trills and valve tremolos these techniques were popular at the time in what some have called a hot jazz style with jamess idol louis armstrong providing an example of one who used these techniques but they later fell out of favor in the s with the advent of cool jazz jamess father instituted a rigorous regime of practice for james as a child and this allowed james to achieve an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range fingering and tonguing growing up in the south james was also exposed to blues music which had an influence on his style as james explained i was brought up in texas with the blues – when i was eleven or twelve years old down in what they call barbecue row i used to sit in with the guys that had the broken bottlenecks on their guitars playing the blues thats all we knew louis armstrong after hearing harry james solo on several numbers while at a benny goodman onenighter with his friend lionel hampton exclaimed to hampton in the vernacular of the time that white boy – he plays like a jig move towards popedit after james left benny goodmans band in  to form his own band he soon found that leading a commercially viable musical group required a broader set of skills than those needed to be a gifted musician playing in someone elses band the james band ran into financial trouble and it became increasingly difficult for james to make payroll and keep the band together in  james lost his contract with columbia records he returned in  and frank sinatra left the band that january it was not long after this that james made a pivotal decision he would adopt a sweeter style that added strings to the band and the band would deliver tunes that were in more of a pop vein and less true to its jazz roots from a commercial standpoint the decision paid off — james soon enjoyed a string of chart topping hits that provided commercial success for him and his band indeed a us treasury report released in  listed harry james and betty grable as the highestpaid couple in the nation what worked well commercially with the public however had the opposite effect on those in the circle of jazz critics dan morgenstern the respected critic and director of the institute of jazz studies called the  release of you made me love you the record that the jazz critics never forgave harry james for recording with james continuing to employ his hot jazz style on pop hits through the s his playing was often labeled as schmaltzy and dismissed by the critics though radio discs from this period reveal jamess continued commitment to jazz a variety of modern arrangements from neal hefti frank devenport johnny richards and jimmy mundy often inspired his musicians and as bop surpassed swing by the late s james was surprisingly open to its influence refocusededit after coasting through the mids james made a complete reevaluation of where he was heading in his musical career count basie provided the impetus by making a significant comeback with his newly formed  men swinging band and james wanted a band with a decided basie flavor james signed with capitol records in  and two years later after releasing new studio versions of many of his previously released songs from columbia james recorded ten new tracks for an album entitled wild about harry this album was the first in a series released on capitol and continuing later on mgm representative of the basie style that james adopted during this period with some of the arrangements provided by former basie saxophonist and arranger ernie wilkins whom james hired for his own band even after his return to more jazzoriented releases in the late s and into the s james never completely regained favor with the jazz critics during his lifetime more recent reissues however such as capitols disc set the capitol vaults jazz series gene krupa and harry james in  have prompted new more favorable analyses of jamess work in  marc myers of jazzwax commented jamess band of the mids was more modern than most of the majors and in  he led one of the finest bands of the year and on jamess releases from – myers noted the james band during this period has been eclipsed by bands led by basie maynard ferguson and stan kenton while each served up its own brand of magnificence james produced more consistently brilliant tracks than the others virtually everything james recorded during this period was an uncompromising swinging gem response to the criticsedit while in london harry james did an interview with the english jazz critic steve voce when voce asked him if the biggest audience was for the commercial numbers he had recorded he visibly bristled james answered that would depend on for whom you are playing if youre playing for a jazz audience im pretty sure that some of the jazz things we do would be a lot more popular than sleepy lagoon and if were playing at a country club or playing vegas in which we have many many types of people then im sure that sleepy lagoon would be more popular at that particular time but i really get bugged about these people talking about commercial tunes because to me if youre gonna be commercial youre gonna stand on your head and make funny noises and do idiotic things i dont think weve ever recorded or played one tune that i didnt particularly love to play otherwise i wouldnt play
