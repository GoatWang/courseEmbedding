watchscheduletopicsabout frontlineshopteacher center lauterbach one of germanys foremost experts on health policy is a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the university of cologne and a member of the german parliament here he discusses the german system of social insurance developed by chancellor otto von bismarck in the th century and what lessons america could learn from it this is an edited transcript of an interview conducted oct   related video germany delivers the basics  and more view this chapter from frontlines sick around the world some highlights from this interview the german system is way less fair than it is expected to be do you lose your health insurance if you lose your job his view of the us health care system why he thinks germanys preventive care isnt as good as that in scandinavian nations   it would help if you could give us a general overview of the german health care system  the german health care system is unique in its attempt to combine competition among sickness funds on the one hand and a universal coverage plan on the other hand most health care systems are either one or the other so you either have private insurance and competition but not everyone is covered for everything or you have a singlepayer system so the ideal types are like the american system on the one hand or the scandinavian or uk systems on the other end germany tries to combine the advantages everyone is covered all sickness funds have to provide a comprehensive benefit package  and there is nevertheless competition for price and quality between the sickness funds  see were confused by that because to an american the reason companies compete is to make more profit but these sickness funds arent making a profit are they no theyre not permitted to make a profit sickness funds do not want to perish they want to survive and grow and the management is better paid if the sickness fund is growing the management is basically losing its job and its prestige if the sickness fund is becoming smaller so the idea is that there is enough of an incentive for competition even if it is nonprofit competition not every form of competition that works is for profit and the nonprofit competition in health care in my view is actually a good solution are there then rankings  by size or number of members and stuff like that yes there is ranking for contribution rate so the cheaper sickness funds with good quality can both advertise their better quality plus their lower contribution rates and therefore be gaining members we had about  sickness funds a couple of months ago we are now down to  i think in two or three years only  or so will survive thats a good thing i think so i think we have too many sickness funds we started with more than  sickness funds but the fewer sickness funds there are the less bureaucracy and the easier the system is to operate but it is important that the best sickness funds survive  and so if im the chairman of one of these sickness funds if i can lure more members my pay goes up definitely your prestige and your pay goes up well those are grounds for competition i can see that i think so and if you are in business and your fund is successful in comparison to others then you basically can swallow other funds so for the management there is enough opportunity to excel yes without profit right ten percent of the population is in the private system the private system works like the us private systems where there is no risk adjustment and there is cherrypicking of healthy patients there is no mandatory enrollment and so forth and interestingly the private market  has a much steeper cost increase than the public system  so this is a kind of a natural experiment despite the fact that the private system insures the most influential and the best paid and  most independent people  the bureaucrats the people who are business owners and those who are welltodo  the private system is not more efficient at least than the public system   can you tell me why did they start this system of private insurance  well in the s and in the s the private system originally was a benefit for the bureaucrats in germany  and this system became ever bigger because the private insurance industry lobbied successfully for making this system bigger in the s and in the s they managed to find a system where they could take everyone beyond  euros income per year but didnt have to take everyone so they only took those that had both high income and a secure job and who was not ill at that time  if im making   a year and i have to buy health insurance why would i want to buy from a private company where it costs more well twothirds of those  actually choose the public system  and secondly the private system does have one advantage the physicians get more money for the same procedure so many of the specialists prefer to work for the private patients because for the same procedure they get double the honorarium  if you do that the doctor is first going to schedule the private guy  exactly currently since private patients are so much more lucrative for the physician the private patients get an appointment immediately more or less while the public patients often have to wait for a couple of weeks  is the insurance company selling the private plan making a profit right they are making a profit or a loss i can see why the insurance company wants to be in that business why the insurer wants to have that policy but why would the system allow the richest  percent to opt out of the overall plan i think unfortunately many opinion leaders in germany  including government officials politicians social service bureaucrats and so forth  they are in the private system and they get paid the private insurance by their employer so for them this is the best of two worlds they have some more expensive and privileged access but they do not have to pay for it themselves  this is a system which is both inefficient and unfair at the same time but it is defended by those who profit from this system and this includes many opinion leaders and many politicians  im surprised to hear that you have a system that sounds unfair because we hear that the german health care is that its fair its equitable everybody has access no the german system is way less fair than it is expected to be and the difference is becoming bigger  the private system with its privilege to pay doctors and hospitals better is basically putting the whole system at jeopardy because many firstclass hospitals and firstclass physicians are wasting their time on trivial cases of privately insured and are no longer accessible for the difficult cases from the public system despite the fact that the hospitals and also the education of those professionals is paid for by public money  lets look at the  percent of people in the health care system would you say germany still has a bismarck model of health insurance coverage for the  percent this is the case for the  percent of the population it is a bismarck type of model because everyone is insured every service which is medically useful is insured and it is a system where the rich pay for the poor  and where the ill are covered by the healthy so it is a nice social support system which is highly accepted by the population  if you asked the german people if every human was entitled to a basic level of health care what would they say i would think that about  percent of the population think that there is a basic entitlement to health care for everyone regardless of age and income and the german system is meeting that need the german system is meeting the bismarckian requirement because everyone is insured and if everyone is insured and the quality is reasonable for everyone i think this is a strength of the system well lets talk about quality how is the quality of health care in germany the quality is average the quality is not as good as people sometimes believe it to be we have problems with chronic diseases the german system allows too many hospitals and specialists to treat chronic diseases we do not have enough volume in many institutions to deliver good quality and we do have fairly strict separations  between primary physicians office specialists and hospital specialists but i think the quality problems can be solved in the next couple of years and we have made major progress in diabetes coronary artery disease and pulmonary disease care how do you do it by setting standards at the national level exactly what happened is the government in  started with socalled disease management programs the disease management programs for chronic conditions are based on recommendations from evidencebased medicine and primary care physicians enroll patients with these diseases for the programs and within a program then the physician and the patient is given a financial incentive to participate patient education is strengthened in these programs and it is documented whether the treatment  is roughly in agreement with the evidencebased medicine recommendation which diseases are covered by this diabetes coronary heart disease heart failure asthma copds  or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and breast cancer these are the conditions that are currently covered and we are considering to cover depression and rheumatory arthritis in the future as well mental health service is covered by the basic plan here definitely all mental health care is covered by the basic plan dental also dental including repair and procedures optical optical care hearing aids basic hearing aids roughly everything which is medically necessary is covered childbirth is covered childbirth is covered and the rehabilitation is covered nursing home care is covered so its basically from prenatal care to the very end of even hospice care is now covered which was not covered until very recently are there controls so at a certain age you can no longer have a costly procedure no there is no age rationing for any procedure  does that make sense economically i do think it makes sense first of all our health care system is not the most expensive it is in comparison to the us about a third cheaper and secondly you should never underestimate the cost of having someone with a disease who is not treated because people that are chronically ill and have no treatment they cost in other social systems or they ultimately end up in the emergency room and then have inferiorquality treatment which is even more expensive   how many germans go bankrupt in a year because of medical bills in germany its impossible to go bankrupt for medical bills because even if you are bankrupt  the social solidarity system pays for your medical bills the idea is if you do have financial problems and a lot of worries for other reasons you do not need to have another burden in not being able to pay medical bills  if you lose your job what happens to your health insurance health insurance continues with no change if you lose a job we do know very well that people who become unemployed are at an increased risk of becoming ill and therefore becoming unemployed is about the worst time to lose health insurance so therefore everyone who loses a job remains in exactly the same insurance system he is in  in america when you lose your job we take it away right  and this is absurd this is exactly the time when you need the support of the health care system not additional problems by the health care system  since you cover people from birth until theyre  years old there must be value in preventive medicine just economic value well the preventive medicine is underdeveloped in germany  this is partly due to the fact that our medical system is very much developed by physicians not by  government agencies or public health officials so physicians focus on coming from their training focus on providing care not avoiding disease and i think this is a problem we must improve preventative education in medical school and in the training of physicians but currently we are not really excellent when it comes to preventative care what system do you think is good at preventive care i think the scandinavian systems are better when it comes to preventative care than the german system because in the scandinavian systems the government is really more active in defining treatment goals and defining health priorities all systems do have advantages and disadvantages the german system is a competitive system with little government intervention the price for this is that the government cannot set a health agenda and the scandinavian systems they do have little competition so therefore you often do have waiting lists but on the other hand you then have the government which can push for prevention no waiting lists in germany you can go see a specialist without waiting the waiting lists even in comparison to the us are not really long waiting lists the privately insured never wait at all and the publicly insured they wait for specialists but they do not wait for the service in general to give an example if you do need a knee replacement in germany you can have a knee replacement within a couple of weeks at the very latest but if you want to have a special knee replacement  a knee replacement by a specialist who is wellknown for the knee replacement in complicated places  and you are coming from a public insurance this is difficult to get is it right that germany last year introduced what we would call a copay we introduced copayments in  and those copayments are limited to a maximum of about  percent of the price of the procedure at the very most and  percent of total income so if someone is very ill and needs a lot of procedures the biggest copayment which is currently to be expected is  percent of the income of that person so if you make  a year  is the most youre going to pay for someone with  of income a year  would be the maximum copayment in a year for this person and that person is also paying some amount for health insurance right  a person who earns say  a year pays about  for health insurance a month this is the maximum public premium which is paid  and someone who earns only  a year typically would pay about  a month and that covers the family too complete family coverage yes in america  a month thats a good deal  a month is expensive but these are the richest people paying that these aretherichest people and  they pay more than they would need for themselves because we need money in order to support those that are unemployed or have only little wage  the  percent who are privately insured where is their contribution to help the poor get insurance those who are privately insured pay only for themselves theres no contribution by them for the poor  i think that is highly unfair because if someone who is better off stays in the public system a lot of his money actually goes for the care of the poor but if that very person changes into the private system then the moneys gone for profit and there is no copayment of the poor whatsoever  i spent some time with a general practitioner  and she told me that her patients now have a copay of  euros a quarter now whats that system this is part of the copayment system the copayment system is roughly speaking  euro every three months for the office physicians then  euro per day for inpatient care in hospital then additionally there is  percent of the drug payments but all copayments together are never permitted to be more than  percent of yearly income how much is a prescription ten percent of the price of the prescription but there is a maximum  the cap is also  euro to an american thats a bargain i can go to the doctors office  times in a quarter and pay  thats true and i can go to the hospital and stay five nights and pay  right this is a good deal nevertheless the copayments are important because they remind people that health care is not for free and i think that the copayments are just about right in order to make sure that everyone understands that solidarity needs the support by everyone on the other hand this is not the kind of copayment where you ask why am i insured if i have to pay for such a copayment  the british have a different mindset that you should never have to pay a medical bill i think that in the uk the impression is that you are entitled for care whatever the costs are and its sometimes not seen that many people have to work for your health care for a long period of time for if you do have surgery and have a complication  then another person has to work for a whole year in order to pay for your surgery and in order to make that clear i think copayments from an ethical point of view are ok  once you pay the hospital the  euros a day the  a day when you go home do you get another bill thats it its only the copayment the rest is picked up by the insurance company by the sickness fund because in america you go in the hospital and you leave and then you get a bill from the hospital you get a bill from the radiologist you get a bill from the surgeon you get a bill from the nurse it goes on for months you never see these bills no if you go to the hospital and you are in the public system the sickness fund you never see these bills  and i think that this is good because if you are sick you should not have to worry about the bills it definitely doesnt support the process of becoming healthy again when you have to fight with bills and bureaucracy  another problem with the american health care system is that american insurance companies can a turn you down and not cover you at all and b they deny claims well denying people and denying claims is both unfair and a waste of money and time for everyone it is major bureaucracy very frustrating and ultimately someone has to pick up the bill so this is only lets say repairing failures in financing the system if the system is wellfinanced and if there is a risk adjustment among competing sickness funds you do not have to deny people or claims very important is that theres a pool of money from which sickness funds do get money if they have poorer or sicker patients because if that is working then you do not have deny anyone you do not have to deny claims and it is of interest to you to take everyone risk adjustment and the risk pool for the sickness funds i think that is the most important single piece of the german health care system which might be of interest to you … who sets the prices for german health care the prices are negotiated by the sickness funds and the physician so there is no government intervention and the price negotiation is then binding for all sickness funds so that makes it possible to have one price for procedures in the public system  that sounds to me like its clearly a multipayer system but the pricing seems to work like a singlepayer system right  is this also true for drug prices it is also true for drug prices for example the same drug is the same price for all sickness funds there is a possibility for sickness funds to negotiate a bargain with the drug companies but roughly speaking the price is the same for one drug for all sickness funds has anybody compared drug prices for the same drug in america and germany the same drugs are way cheaper in germany than in america because obviously if all sickness funds negotiate with the drug companies for a single price then the market power of the sickness funds is fully used so therefore you would expect the prices to be lower for the drugs in germany and this is exactly what you see at least for nongeneric drugs  one argument for higher prices is that the drug companies need to get these high prices in america to finance innovation do you buy that i think we have seen little innovation by the drug companies that charge the highest prices recently  all markets typically manage innovation without having to charge subsidized prices  so the argument that you should pay higher prices to drug companies to promote innovation thats wrong i dont know a single economist who would buy into that argument i think this is a lobbyist argument a market works best if there are no inefficiencies and higherthannecessary prices are inefficiencies and the drug companies now spend more for marketing the drugs than for innovating the drugs this clearly is an artifact which comes across with this system of subsidized and toohigh prices who decides what drugs are covered by the insurance plan well we have a panel of physicians and scientists that determines whether the drugs given the studies work or not and drugs which do not work  or whose effects are negative are not covered  but there are other concerns too viagra works but does the system pay for viagra well viagra is considered to be a lifestyle drug so the question is if the system doesnt have to pay for a good red wine why should it have to pay for viagra and the answer is it doesnt it doesnt the system will lose its acceptance and credibility as a system that supports those who need care if it pays for lifestyle drugs like viagra how about these drugs that are incredibly expensive like these endoflife cancer drugs they are covered i mean there isnt a single drug that is not covered because it is too expensive it is a different question whether those drugs should be prescribed as they currently are often these very expensive endoflife cancer drugs are shown to work for a small group of patients and then are prescribed for a much larger group and this is a big problem in germany but for those who belong to a group of patients that definitely profits from the drug there are no exclusions whatever the prices are a lot of people weve spoken to are worried about the cost of health care in germany  about  percent of gdp gross domestic product but i get the sense from talking to you that youre not worried about that number i think from an economics point of view it is important that the money that is spent for health care is well spent  what is the costeffectiveness of the money that is used  because if the money is well spent many people benefit from the system and it is also a good market for finding employment i do not see a reason why we should limit ourselves when it comes to very qualified and humane employment opportunities if there is no waste and if there is medical need   as you say germany has pretty good results it has fairly good costs its equitable and yet theyre constantly talking about reforming it does that mean people are not satisfied well people are by and large satisfied physicians are not always satisfied because they would like to earn more money we have actually now decided that we will increase physician income in particular for office physicians we have already increased the income for hospital physicians by about  percent but i dont know a single european system where physicians do not all the time ask for more money this is basically part of the description of their job thats i think in every country weve been to i think if the physicians are not asking for more money at a given time then you should worry about them  but on average physicians are doing fairly well  for example an office physician on average has about  per month after cost of the office and this is not that bad in the german setting   so this is a general practitioner  netting  a year per year on average before taxes its not bad money but its onehalf or onethird of what youd make in america exactly but we have more physicians per capita so if we have fewer physicians in the future because less physicians are in training currently then there will be higher income per physician  in most european countries the payment is roughly comparable  would you say that germany has socialized medical care no its not a socialized system because you can pick your insurance public or private many people can even opt out and the sickness funds compete for members you have free hospital or physician choice there are very few limits on choice in the system  in a socialized system everything is planned in germany basically everything is open for nonprofit competition for me another definition would be who owns the facilities are the hospitals private roughly  percent of the hospitals are private and forprofit  percent are nonprofit hospitals and about  percent of all office physicians are for a profit  as you know in america we have separate health care systems for people under  over  children under  who are sick we have a system for poor people we have a system for veterans and military how does germany do this is everybody in the same system everyone is in the same system with the exception of the  percent who are in the private system  this limits bureaucracy this limits transfer costs and makes the system also reasonably transparent can you give us a rough percentage of how much german health care spending goes for administrative costs yes in the public systems the total of administrative costs is about  percent and in the private system it is about  percent do you have a number for the us system i think the best numbers for the us system is that about a fifth  up to  percent  is for administrative cost so the us system is comparable to the german private system but is about three or four times more expensive administrativecostwise than the public german system the german public system is roughly comparable to the administrative costs of the singlepayer systems in the scandinavian countries or the uk   did you live in america i lived in the united states for nine years so one year in arizona one year in texas san antonio and seven years in boston did you ever have to go to the doctor yeah i did from time to time  for example injured my knee in a sports injury and i had to wait for an orthopedic surgeon for a couple of months so i ultimately called him up and said well im doing research on your system and i was immediately seen  if you hurt your knee in germany how long would you wait i would immediately be seen on the other hand i should say i was then seen by a very good orthopedic surgeon this was a true specialist so i think that the us system does have very good physicians but it is very difficult to find out who the good physicians are and to basically get access   you have been somewhat critical of the german system you see some problems in it give an assessment of the us health care system well in comparison to the us health care system the german system is clearly better because the german health care system works for everyone who needs care  costs little money and its not a system about which you have to worry all the time so in case you need health care the health care is there that you can rely on i think that for us the risk is that the private system undermines the solidarity principle  if that is fixed and we concentrate a little bit on better competition and more research i think the german health care system is a nice third way between a forprofit system on the one hand and lets say a singlepayer system on the other hand how do you feel about our system how would you assess the us health care system the us has a system that does have a poor costbenefit ratio i mean  million people lack insurance another  million or so are underinsured the people who are insured do have to worry whether they are able to pay the bills people become bankrupt because they cannot pay the medical bills and there are vast differences in the quality of care depending on how much you are prepared and able to pay i think the system is not working well you watch american politics youre in german politics now do you think were going to change i think the democrats will win the election and they will then not change the system is my personal view then they will lose a lot of credibility  this is my view  what would you say to americans what could we learn from looking at the german health care system  one can learn that competition is good you need competition in the health care system and transparency but you do not need forprofit competition so limit profit and maximize competition and have everyone covered
