kraneshares zacks new china etf formerly kraneshares csi new china etf click to enlarge investment objective the kraneshares zacks new china etf the fund seeks to provide investment results that before fees and expenses correspond generally to the price and yield performance of a specific foreign equity securities benchmark the funds current benchmark is the zacks new china index the underlying index fees and expenses of the fund the following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund the table below does not include the brokerage commissions that you may pay when purchasing or selling shares of the fund click to enlarge   click to enlarge shareholder fees fees paid directly from your investment     none   annual fund operating

  click to enlarge  year    years    years    years           portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance for the fiscal year ended march   the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio this rate excludes the value of portfolio securities received or delivered as a result of inkind creations or redemptions of the funds shares principal investment strategies under normal circumstances the fund will invest at least  of its total assets in securities of the underlying index or in depositary receipts representing securities of the underlying index the underlying index takes a smartbeta approach to provide exposure to companies listed in mainland china hong kong and the united states whose primary business or businesses the index sponsor zacks index services zacks has determined are important in the current fiveyear plan plan of the central chinese government zacks smartbeta approach evaluates the sectors it expected to benefit from the plan and then ranks the stocks within each sector based on various investment factors including price cash flow free cash flow momentum and volatility based on the foregoing the top  stocks will be included in the underlying index as of each rebalance date the top  largest capitalization stocks included in the underlying index typically will represent approximately  of the underlying index each the middle  capitalization stocks will represent approximately  of the underlying index each and the smallest  capitalization stocks will represent approximately  of the underlying index each in addition as of the rebalance date no sector will represent more than  of the underlying index the underlying index will be rebalanced annually the fund principally expects to obtain exposure to china ashare components of the underlying index by investing through the shanghaihong kong stock connect program or a similar program such as the shenzhenhong kong stock connect program      kraneshares zacks new china etf formerly kraneshares csi new china etf click to enlarge the plan is a series of development initiatives that have been released by the chinese government every five years since  the plan outlines the governments goals for among other things social and economic growth and industrial planning in key sectors and regions for example the central chinese government released the thirteenth five year plan    in march  the thirteenth five year plan emphasizes improving the lives of chinese citizens health care technology the environment more competitive markets agriculture the military and education the underlying index defines chinese companies to include companies incorporated in china companies with a majority of their business in china companies headquartered in china companies directly or indirectly controlled by an entity owned by a chinese central provincial or municipal government and companies listed for trading in hong kong with significant operations in china as of june   the underlying index included  securities of companies with a total market capitalization of  trillion and a weighted average market capitalization of  billion the fund may invest up to  of its assets in investments that are not included in the underlying index but that the fund believes will help it track the underlying index these investments include investments in the shares of or depositary receipts representing other equity issuers including china ashares and bshares to the extent the fund invests in china ashares it would expect to do so through the shanghaihong kong stock connect program or a similar program such as the shenzhenhong kong stock connect program the fund employs a passive management investment strategy in seeking to achieve its investment objective the fund generally will use a replication methodology meaning it will invest in all of the securities comprising the underlying index in proportion to the weightings in the underlying index however the fund may utilize a representative sampling methodology under various circumstances including where it may not be possible or practicable to purchase all of the securities in the underlying index representative sampling is an indexing strategy that generally involves investing in a representative sample of securities that has an investment profile similar to the underlying index the fund is expected to concentrate its investments  ie hold  or more of its total assets in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the underlying index is so concentrated as of june   issuers in the information technology sector  and materials sector  represented a significant portion of the underlying index the fund is nondiversified zacks is independent of the fund and the funds investment adviser krane funds advisors llc the adviser zacks determines the components and the relative weightings of the securities in the underlying index principal risks as with all exchange traded funds etfs a shareholder of the fund is subject to the risk that his or her investment could lose money the fund may not achieve its investment objective and an investment in the fund is not by itself a complete or balanced investment program an investment in the fund is not a deposit with a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency in addition to these risks the fund is subject to a number of additional risks that may affect the value of its shares including ashares risk   investments in ashares are heavily regulated and the recoupment and repatriation of assets invested in ashares is subject to restrictions by the chinese government ashares may be subject to frequent and widespread trading halts and may become illiquid this could cause volatility in the funds share price and subject the fund to a greater risk of trading halts custody risks   ashares may not be as well protected as they would be if it were possible for them to be registered and held solely in the name of the fund there is a risk that creditors of the entity holding the ashares may pursue the funds ashares and that regulatory actions may affect the fund tax risk   per a circular caishui   the fund is expected to be temporarily exempt from the chinese withholding tax wht on capital gains on trading in ashares as of november   there is no indication as to how long the temporary exemption will remain in effect accordingly the fund may be subject to such taxes in the future if krane expects such wht on trading in ashares to be imposed krane reserves the right to establish a reserve for such tax if the fund establishes such a reserve but is not ultimately subject to the tax shareholders who redeemed or sold their shares while the reserve was in place will effectively bear the tax and may not benefit from the later release if any of the reserve conversely if the fund does not establish such a reserve but ultimately is subject to the tax shareholders who redeemed or sold their shares prior to the tax being withheld reserved or paid will have effectively avoided the tax even if they benefited from the trading that precipitated the funds payment of it the wht on dividends and interest if any is normally withheld by the funds custodian bank to the extent such wht was not withheld by the funds custodian bank however krane has made or would generally need to make relevant provision for the tax on dividends from ashares and any relevant interest      kraneshares zacks new china etf formerly kraneshares csi new china etf click to enlarge investors should note that such provision may be excessive or inadequate to meet actual wht liabilities which could include interest and penalties on the funds investments as a result investors may be advantaged or disadvantaged depending on the final rules of the relevant prc tax authorities authorized participants concentration risk   the fund has a limited number of financial institutions that may act as authorized participants to the extent they cannot or are otherwise unwilling to engage in creation and redemption transactions with the fund and no other authorized participant steps in shares of the fund may trade like closedend fund shares at a significant discount to net asset value and may face delisting from the exchange concentration risk   because the funds assets will be concentrated in an industry or group of industries or sector to the extent that the underlying index concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries or sector the fund is subject to loss due to adverse occurrences that may affect that industry or group of industries or sector market conditions interest rates and economic regulatory or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or a group of related industries and the securities of companies in that industry or group of industries could react similarly to these or other developments from time to time the fund may invest a significant percentage of its assets in issuers in a single industry or the same group of industries or sector of the economy while the funds sector and industry exposure is expected to vary over time based on the composition of the underlying index the fund is currently subject to the risks described below the fund may have significant exposure to other industries or sectors over time information technology sector risk   the value of stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles rapid product obsolescence government regulation and competition both domestically and internationally including competition from competitors with lower production costs technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology especially those of smaller lessseasoned companies tend to be more volatile than the overall market materials sector risk   the materials sector may be adversely impacted by the volatility of commodity prices exchange rates depletion of resources overproduction litigation and government regulations among other factors currency risk   the funds nav is determined on the basis of the us dollar therefore the fund may lose value if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the us dollar even if the local currency value of the funds holdings goes up depositary receipt risk   the fund may hold the securities of chinese and other nonus companies in the form of depositary receipts including adrs the underlying securities of the depositary receipts in the funds portfolio are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may affect the value of the funds portfolio in addition the value of the securities underlying the depositary receipts may change materially when the us markets are not open for trading which will affect the value of the depositary receipts like direct investments in foreign securities investments in depositary receipts involve political and economic risks distinct from those associated with investing in the securities of us issuers emerging markets risk   the funds investments in emerging markets are subject to greater risk of loss than investments in developed markets this is due to among other things greater market volatility greater risk of asset seizures and capital controls lower trading volume political and economic instability greater risk of market shutdown and more governmental limitations on foreign investments than typically found in developed markets equity securities risk   an investment in the fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund holding equity securities such as market fluctuations changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices equity securities are subject to volatile changes in value and their values may be more volatile than other asset classes focused portfolio risk   changes in the value of a small number of issuers are likely to have a larger impact on the funds net asset value than if the fund held a greater number of issuers foreign securities risk   investments in securities of nonus issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of us issuers such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability there may be less information publicly available about nonus issuers nonus issuers especially issuers in china and other emerging markets may also be subject to different accounting auditing financial reporting and investor protection standards than us issuers specifically issuers in china are subject to less stringent requirements regarding accounting auditing financial reporting and record keeping than are issuers in more developed markets and therefore all material information may not be available or reliable investments in foreign securities may be less liquid than investments in us securities additionally the securities markets in china have a limited operating history and are not as developed as those in the us a small number of issuers may represent a large portion of the china market as a whole and prices      kraneshares zacks new china etf formerly kraneshares csi new china etf click to enlarge for securities of these issuers may be very sensitive to adverse political economic or regulatory developments in china and other asian countries and may experience significant losses in such conditions the value of chinese currencies may also vary significantly relative to the us dollar affecting the funds investments income from securities of nonus issuers including in the case of chinese issuers gains on the sale of such securities may be subject to foreign taxes even if the fund qualifies to pass these taxes through to shareholders your ability to claim a credit for such taxes may be limited particularly in the case of taxes on capital gains geographic focus risk   the funds investments are focused in china and hong kong and therefore the fund will be susceptible to adverse market political regulatory and geographic events affecting those regions china   the chinese economy is generally considered an emerging market and can be significantly affected by economic and political conditions and policy in china and surrounding asian countries in addition the chinese economy is exportdriven and highly reliant on trade a downturn in the economies of chinas primary trading partners could slow or eliminate the growth of the chinese economy and adversely impact the funds investments the chinese government strictly regulates the payment of foreign currency denominated obligations and sets monetary policy and may introduce new laws and regulations that have an adverse effect on the fund although china has begun the process of privatizing certain sectors of its economy privatized entities may lose money andor be renationalized an investment in the fund involves a risk of total loss in the chinese securities markets a small number of issuers may represent a large portion of the entire market the chinese securities markets are characterized by relatively frequent trading halts and low trading volume resulting in substantially less liquidity and greater price volatility further the chinese economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners such as the united states japan and countries in the european union any reduction in this trading may cause an adverse impact on the chinese economy and thus the value of the funds investments in recent years chinese entities have incurred significant levels of debt and chinese financial institutions currently hold large amounts of nonperforming loans thus there exists a possibility that widespread defaults could occur which could trigger a financial crisis freeze chinese debt and finance markets and make certain chinese securities illiquid hong kong   the economy of hong kong has few natural resources and any fluctuation or shortage in the commodity markets could have a significant adverse effect on the hong kong economy hong kong is also heavily dependent on international trade and finance additionally the continuation and success of the current political economic legal and social policies of hong kong is dependent on and subject to the control of the chinese government high portfolio turnover risk   the funds strategy may result in high turnover rates which may increase the funds brokerage commission costs and negatively impact the funds performance international closed market trading risk   because the funds underlying securities trade on markets that may be closed when the exchange is open there are likely to be deviations between current pricing of an underlying security and stale pricing resulting in the fund trading at a discount or premium to net asset value that may be greater than those incurred by other exchangetraded funds largecapitalization risk   investments in large capitalization companies may go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions and may underperform other market segments some large capitalization companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges and attain the high growth rate of successful smaller companies especially during extended periods of economic expansion as such returns on investments in stocks of large capitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in stocks of small and mid capitalization companies liquidity risk   the funds investments are subject to liquidity risk which exists when an investment is or becomes difficult to purchase or sell if a transaction is particularly large or if the relevant market is or becomes illiquid it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or price which may cause the fund to suffer significant losses and difficulties in meeting redemptions if a number of securities held by the fund halt trading such as due to an exchanges limitup limitdown rules it may have a cascading effect and cause the fund to halt trading volatility in market prices will increase the risk of the fund being subject to a trading halt management risk   because the fund may not fully replicate the underlying index and may hold less than the total number of securities in the underlying index the fund is subject to management risk this is the risk that the advisers security selection process which is subject to a number of constraints may not produce the intended results market risk   the values of securities in the underlying index could decline generally or could underperform other investments in addition there is a risk that policy changes by the us government federal reserve and      kraneshares zacks new china etf formerly kraneshares csi new china etf click to enlarge or other government actors such as increasing interest rates could cause increased volatility in global financial markets and higher levels of fund redemptions which could have a negative impact on the fund further the fund is susceptible to the risk that certain investments may be difficult or impossible to sell at a favorable time or price market developments may cause the funds investments to become less liquid and subject to erratic price movements such market developments may also cause the fund to encounter difficulties in timely honoring redemptions especially if market events cause an increased incidence of shareholder redemptions nondiversified fund risk   because the fund is nondiversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in securities of individual issuers than a diversified fund changes in the market value of a single issuer could cause greater fluctuations in the funds share price than would occur in a diversified fund this may increase the funds volatility and cause the performance of a relatively small number of issuers to have a greater impact on the funds performance passive investment risk   the fund is not actively managed and therefore may not sell an equity security due to current or projected underperformance of a security industry or sector to the extent the fund uses a representative sampling approach it may result in it holding a smaller number of securities than are in the underlying index as a result an adverse development to an issuer of securities that the fund holds could result in a greater decline in nav than would be the case if the fund held more of the securities in the underlying index premiumdiscount risk   although it is expected that the market price of the shares of the fund will approximate the funds nav there may be times when the market price of the shares is more than the nav intraday premium or less than the nav intraday discount as a result shareholders of the fund may pay more than nav when purchasing shares and receive less than nav when selling fund shares this risk is heightened in times of market volatility or periods of steep market declines secondary market trading risk   investors buying or selling shares in the secondary market will normally pay brokerage commissions which are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors buying or selling relatively small amounts of shares secondary market trading in fund shares may be halted by the exchange because of market conditions or other reasons if a trading halt occurs a shareholder may temporarily be unable to purchase or sell shares of the fund in addition although the funds shares are listed on the exchange there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained shanghaihong kong stock connect program risk   the shanghaihong kong stock connect program is subject to daily and aggregate quota limitations and an investor cannot purchase and sell the same security on the same trading day which may restrict the funds ability to invest in ashares through the program and to enter into or exit trades on a timely basis the shanghai market may be open at a time when the shanghaihong kong stock connect program is not active with the result that prices of ashares may fluctuate at times when the fund is unable to add to or exit its positions because the shanghaihong kong stock connect program is new the actual effect on the market for trading ashares with the introduction of large numbers of foreign investors is unknown further regulations or restrictions such as limitations on redemptions or suspension of trading may adversely impact the program there is no guarantee that the shanghai and hong kong stock exchanges will continue to support the shanghaihong kong stock connect program in the future any future stock connect program such as the shenzhenhong kong stock connect program would be subject to similar risks smalland midcapitalization company risk   investing in the securities of small and midcapitalization companies involves greater risk and the possibility of greater price volatility than investing in larger capitalization companies and more established companies since small and mediumsized companies may have limited operating histories product lines and financial resources the securities of these companies may lack sufficient market liquidity and can be sensitive to expected changes in interest rates borrowing costs and earnings these companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and they may be more sensitive to market conditions tax risk   in order to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated investment companies and avoid fundlevel taxes the fund must satisfy certain distribution requirements capital controls and currency controls may affect the funds ability to meet the applicable distribution requirements if the fund fails to satisfy the distribution requirement necessary to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company for any taxable year the fund would be treated as a corporation subject to us federal income tax thereby subjecting any income earned by the fund to tax at the corporate level if the fund fails to satisfy a separate distribution requirement it will be subject to a fundlevel excise tax these fundlevel taxes will apply in addition to taxes payable at the shareholder level on distributions tracking error risk   the funds return may not match or achieve a high degree of correlation with the return of the underlying index to the extent the fund utilizes a representative sampling approach andor invests in      kraneshares zacks new china etf formerly kraneshares csi new china etf click to enlarge securities that are not contained in the underlying index it may experience tracking error to a greater extent than if the fund sought to replicate the underlying index this may be due to among other factors the fund holding cash under certain circumstances in lieu of underlying index securities such as when the fund is subject to delays converting us dollars into a foreign currency to purchase foreign securities the fund may not be able to invest in certain components of the underlying index due to legal restrictions imposed by foreign governments or other regulatory reasons in addition securities included in the underlying index may be suspended from trading to the extent the fund calculates its nav based on fair value prices and the value of the underlying index is based on securities closing prices on local foreign markets the funds ability to track the underlying index may be adversely affected changes in currency exchange rates or delays in converting currencies may also cause tracking error valuation risk   independent market quotations for the nonus securities held by the fund may not be readily available and such securities may be fair valued in addition the securities in which the fund invests may trade on days that the fund does not price its shares as a result the value of fund shares may change on days when investors cannot purchase or sell their holdings performance information the following bar chart and table

portfolio manager mark schlarbaum managing partner of the adviser has had primary responsibility for trading the funds portfolio securities since december  purchase and sale of fund shares shares may be purchased and redeemed from the fund only in creation units of  shares or multiples thereof as a practical matter only institutions and large investors such as market makers or other large brokerdealers purchase or redeem creation units most investors will buy and sell shares of the fund on the exchange individual shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like other publicly traded securities through a brokerdealer on the exchange these transactions do not involve the fund the price of an individual fund share is based on market prices which may be different from its nav as a result the funds shares may trade at a price greater than the nav at a premium or less than the nav at a discount most investors will incur customary brokerage commissions and charges
