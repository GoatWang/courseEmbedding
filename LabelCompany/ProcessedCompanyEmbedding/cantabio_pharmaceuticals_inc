cantabio pharmaceuticals inc ctbo otcqbctbo view investor info home scientific approach therapeutic targets scientific approach therapeutic targets dj protein loss of and reduced function of the dj protein has been linked to the onset of a variety of diseases such as parkinson’s disease alzheimer’s disease stroke amyotrophic lateral sclerosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and type ii diabetes while dj overexpression is a marker of a variety of cancers the dj protein is considered to be one of the primary therapeutic targets for parkinson’s disease as it is genetically linked to the onset of familial parkinson’s disease and loss of its functions is associated with triggering sporadic parkinson’s disease dj is proposed to have multiple functions including redoxsensitive antioxidant and chaperon activities for example it inhibits the aggregation of asynuclein a process linked to the onset of parkinson’s disease the downregulation of endogenous dj sensitizes neurons to cell death induced by oxidative insults whereas elevated levels of wildtype but not mutant dj protect neurons from oxidative stress and other protein misfolding related insults dj lossoffunction flies are also hypersensitive to oxidative stress and dj knockout mice show nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficits and are hypersensitive to the toxic effects of oxidative stress under oxidizing conditions dj can undergo superfluous oxidation of several cys and met residues which may lead to dj inactivity as a result of structural destabilization and aggregation of the protein overoxidized dj has been observed in patients with the sporadic form of pd superfluous oxidation of dj during disease conditions leads to dj inactivity as a result of structural destabilization and aggregation of the protein tau protein aggregation of the tau protein is linked to the onset and progression of tauopathies which represent a subset of neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer’s disease ad which represents around  of incidences and frontotemporal dementias ftd in these diseases tau protein accumulates into protein deposits known as neurofibrillary tangles nfts in the patient’s brain there is an established link between familial mutations in the tau gene on chromosome  ftdp and earlyonset forms of ftd with parkinsonism and tau is one of the currently most recognized targets for the potential treatment of ad under normal conditions tau is known to stabilize microtubules within cells in ad however tau shows a reduction in its affinity towards microtubules and this lack of binding to microtubules is thought to be one of the main reasons why tau aggregates abnormally in this disease cantabio’s tau program aims to stabilize the tau protein and to preserve its natural function in disease affected cells aβ peptide the aggregation and amyloid formation of the aβ peptide is linked to the onset and progression of alzheimer’s disease ad with amyloid plaques being a key pathological hallmark of ad the residue aβ peptide is the most abundant aβ in human normal and ad brains followed by the residue peptide these aβ peptides are intrinsically disordered and thus lack a stable d structure aβ peptides are produced after proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein at cholesterolrich regions of neuronal membranes and secreted into the extracellular space while their function is not well understood it is now widely accepted that oligomeric species of aβ peptides generated through their aggregation process rather than amyloid fibrils are the main source of aβ related toxicity thus it is the presence of these oligomers that leads to neuronal loss and pathogenicity in ad theoretical representation of the protein ab or tau aggregation process sign up for

abeta peptide for the treatment of alzheimers disease in collaboration with novalix april    et  source cantabio pharmaceuticals inc palo alto calif april   globe newswire  cantabio pharmaceuticals inc otcqbctbo announced today a new preclinical therapeutic program for alzheimer’s disease which it is pursuing through its drug discovery partnership with novalix this program is aimed at the development of small molecule chaperones that stabilize the abeta peptide the aggregation of which is considered to be a key element in the onset and progression of alzheimer’s disease this new program which is the result of collaborative work between cantabio and novalix is based on the discovery of novel small molecules that interact with the abeta peptide which were identified using novalix’s high throughput chemical microarray based surface plasmon resonance sprworm screen a unique high throughput biophysics based binding assay platform  cantabio aims to develop a novel therapy for the treatment of alzheimers disease which impacts an estimated  million americans including  individuals below the age of  alzheimer’s is the th leading cause of death in the united states with  seniors expected to die in  with the disease the annual number of new cases of alzheimers is projected to double by  with a public cost of direct care currently at  billion there is currently no disease modifying treatment available for this growing problem dr gergely toth cantabios ceo said we are delighted to announce this exciting program which fits in well with cantabio’s existing portfolio of candidates and further demonstrates our innovative pharmacological chaperone based drug discovery approach in the field of alzheimer’s parkinson’s and related diseases our collaboration with novalix has been highly productive and has helped us to develop novel therapeutic candidates using their unique high throughput sprworm screen novalix has always been very supportive of our approach and vision we look forward to continuing to work with them as our industrial partner in drug discovery and to continue to develop candidate therapies in this exciting and highly promising area  our work gives us the potential to address important disease targets and to tackle intrinsically disordered proteins such as the abeta peptide  the aggregation and amyloid formation of the abeta peptide has been a major focus of alzheimer’s disease targeted therapies to date typically focussed on immunotherapy approaches  we believe that our abeta small molecule pharmacological chaperone program is a strong alternative to these efforts and a novel therapeutic approach which has the potential to be a more cost effective solution for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease novalix’s ceo dr denis zeyer said “we are happy to be working with the cantabio team to develop exciting new technologies and to showcase the very high potential of the sprworm screen to identify valuable chemical starting points for the targeting of protein – protein interactions cantabio’s approach to drug discovery has we believe high potential to produce novel first in class therapies in these disease areas which have a very high unmet need for disease treating drugs about cantabio pharmaceuticals inc cantabio is focused on bringing novel first in class drug candidates into clinical trials and beyond through the discovery and development of innovative pharmacological chaperone and protein delivery based therapeutics focusing on protein systems implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer’s and parkinson’s and oxidative stress more information is available at wwwcantabiocom about novalix novalix is a privately owned organization providing expert driven outsourcing and
