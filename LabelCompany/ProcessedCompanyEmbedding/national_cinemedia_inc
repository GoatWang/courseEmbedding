national cinemedia llc all rights reserved national cinemedia niche industry leader selling at an year low  national cinemedia inc nasdaqncmi  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»national cinemedia niche industry leader selling at an year lowjun  about national cinemedia ncmi jeff marston contrarian eventdriven valuesummarya bad q  print led to a  selloff the stock now hovers at prices not seen since late national cinemedia enjoys a strong industry position and stable free cash flowsuncertainty abounds but the shares are worth double the current price business overview national cinemedia inc nasdaqncmi is in the business of selling screen time to advertisers looking to plug their wares to movie theater audiences if youve ever been to a movie in america youve seen national cinemedias flagship product  the string of advertisements lasting approximately  minutes just before the theater goes totally dark and the previews start national cinemedia breaks up this block of screen time into a couple dozen short slices and sells it to advertisers source national cinemedia investor presentation dated june   the company also sells inlobby marketing and promotional placements and operates several stateoftheart digital advertising platforms you may wonder why theater chains would allow national cinemedia to sell ad spots in their theaters in other words why dont the theater chains just sell the ads and keep all that revenue for themselves the answer to this question is crucial to understanding national cinemedias business model in  subsidiaries of the three largest theater chains amc entertainment holdings inc nyseamc regal entertainment group nysergc and cinemark holdings inc nysecnk created national cinemedia in order to essentially outsource the ad monetization aspect of their theater operations national cinemedia therefore refers to amc regal and cinemark as founding members or founders in exchange for longterm guaranteed access to the founding members movie theaters national cinemedia owes the founders theater access fees which must be no less than  of the firms aggregate advertising revenue therefore the relationship between national cinemedia and the three founders is mutually beneficial the founders all have a stake in national cinemedias success and vice versa this unique arrangement provides national cinemedia with a strong moat in the niche industry of movie theater ad sales national cinemedia is the undisputed leader with around  of total market share source ncmi investor presentation although national cinemedia has never been a highflying growth stock the small caps unmatched ability to reach theater audiences has afforded the firm with solid pricing power what ad industry pros call costs per mille or cpm and generated consistent and ample free cash flow every year since ncmi went public in  chart by author data from morningstar in addition national cinemedia has historically paid a generous dividend which now sits at over  chart by author data from morningstar finally the firm has enjoyed consistent albeit modest revenue growth throughout its history source ncmi investor presentation investment thesis with that overview out of the way ill dive into the reasons why i bought national cinemedia shares recently although this isnt a name with earthshattering fundamentals the bottom line is that there is a good price for almost any business and right now ncmis stock is firmly in deep value territory on may th national cinemedia reported a q  performance that caused investors to stampede out of the stock like someone yelled fire in a crowded theater on may th ncmi closed at  down a stunning  from the  close on may th since then the stock has continued to wander down to where it now hovers in the high s ncmi hasnt traded below  since december  which means that the stock currently trades at roughly an eightyear low bear in mind that in  national cinemedias operating cash flow was less than onefourth what it is today and the dividend was less than half of todays payout ncmi stock price threemonth history chart from morningstar companies report bad quarters all the time but very rarely does a bad print result in a  selloff i believe there are a few reasons why this occurred the general idea is that fear and uncertainty have been building around any name connected to traditional video for years and around ncmi in particular the bad quarterly results tipped the scales leading to outright panic first ncmi hired a new ceo less than two years ago and leadership transition always causes uncertainty second credit suisse analyst omar sheikh expressed the conventional wisdom on february st when he downgraded ncmi along with several other names connected to the movie theater industry after all everyone knows that netflix nasdaqnflx and amazon nasdaqamzn prime video will eventually kill brick and mortar theater chains right third national cinemedias balance sheet is more than a little scary on the positive side no maturities are due until  and the leverage ratios are nowhere near being in breach of covenant however total liabilities have been greater than total assets for years which means the company has a negative book value longterm debts are m for a firm with a market cap of less than m these numbers should make any investor cautious finally if the market is worried about the future of brick and mortar theaters then it is especially pessimistic regarding whats been happening in the traditional advertising space lately perhaps most importantly the proliferation of diverse media and entertainment options makes it harder and harder for advertisers to reach consumers where they are some observers contend that traditional marketing is doomed and that in order to reach a target audience businesses must pile resources into new fragmented channels like social media although ncmi operates a cutting edge digital ad platform the firm is by and large a traditional marketing broker that would presumably be hurt by a macro trend like this with all this noise fear and uncertainty in the background the bad print on may th served as a tipping point that sent the shares tumbling the fear is overblown now im not going to say that the negative factors described above arent valid cause for concern cheap stocks are always cheap for a reason what im saying is that i believe the fear is overdone and ncmis shares have solid value at their current price the discount cash flow analysis below produces an intrinsic value for the company of   more than double the current price here are the assumptions and inputs i used  ncmi will continue to plod along as a nogrowth dividend stock  growth in free cash in perpetuity  the firm delivers annual free cash flow results equal to its average result over the last  years fcf is m per year going forward i believe this is a conservative number considering that s fcf result was m and the average for the last four years was m  discount rate is  i believe this is a conservative discount rate considering it is unlikely that most investors will be able to find a riskfree investment yielding a  rate of return under current market conditions year           free cash flow in millions of usd           discount factor           discounted value of fcf in millions of usd           sum of discounted cash m discounted perpetuity cash m shares outstanding m intrinsic value per share  of course just because i think the shares are worth  doesnt mean they will reach that level any time soon and in particular we will likely need at least one catalyst to get back to that level however for what its worth the latest sell side analyst to weigh in on the name eric wold from b riley and co reiterated his buy rating and assigned a  price target so at least one industry professional seems to concur with my valuation how can a company have a pe of  and a pfcf of  note the next few paragraphs are meant to explain a couple points that are important to understand when analyzing national cinemedias financial statements if the company didnt pop up when you ran your last screen for cheap stocks theres a good reason why so far ive been talking up ncmis strong free cash flow but havent mentioned earnings or profit once if you look at the earnings data in isolation youll notice that the valuation doesnt look great with a trailing pe of almost  this gives an earnings yield or capitalization rate of about  further since the earnings look somewhat weak the dividend payout ratio also looks scary at over  in other words dividend payments appear to be double earnings which would appear to be unsustainable however if we compare the earnings to the cash flow numbers a surprise awaits at a current price of  and last years free cash flow per share of  we get a pfcf under  for an impressive free cash flow yield of over  companies like enron are notorious for inflating earnings through arcane accounting tricks but in this case ncmis earnings are actually much lower than wed expect them to be so what gives why the big disparity between earnings and free cash the explanation has to do with the nuances surrounding the way national cinemedia amortizes its intangible assets if you look at the firms balance sheet youll see that the vast majority of the value on the asset side is in the form of intangible assets these intangibles consist of the longterm contracts that ncmi holds with various movie theater chains such as founders amc regal and cinemark to sell screen time and other opportunities to advertisers ncmi amortizes these assets ie the contracts on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives now consider that ncmi never purchased these contracts from the founders and indeed the price that the company paid basically amounts to its side of the contract ie its agreement to dole out a portion of aggregate advertising revenue to the founders and the other theater operators so if ncmi never paid a price for the vast majority of its assets how can it assign a value to them the answer is found on page  of the  k ncmis intangible assets with its founding members are recorded at the fair market value of ncm incs publicly traded stock as of the date on which the common membership units were issued say what basically ncmi issues a special type of stock called a common membership unit to the founders in order to ensure that the founders receive an appropriate share of the companys ad revenues designed to correspond with the number of theaters that each founder provides ncmi access to since the common membership units are interchangeable with the ncmi stock their value is appropriately equal to the value of the companys stock and since the firm is theoretically getting a square deal here the value of the contract it receives in exchange for issuing common membership units should be equal to the value of the units issued finally since ncmi issued most of its membership units early in its history when the stock traded at higher prices the  ipo price was  the assets currently on the balance sheet are priced higher than any assets that the company would acquire today this means that ncmi is still amortizing highly priced intangibles that it acquired over  years ago the bottom line is that ncmi has m worth of rather arbitrarily valued intangible assets on its balance sheet that need to be amortized every single quarter the result is a large and unavoidable accounting expense that has nothing to do with operating performance but which occurs like clockwork every quarter and serves to obscure what would be otherwise very strong earnings the only way ncmi could hope to avoid this amortization expense in the future would be to significantly write down the value of its intangible assets such an event would be a doubleedged sword for the firm because by writing down its intangibles ncmis book value would immediately plummet deeper into negative territory but at the same time reported net income would likely be vastly improved going forward now to be clear im not criticizing the accounting rules surrounding the amortization of intangible assets here and clearly ncmis contracts with the founders have an expiration date so they must be losing value over time however its hard not to conclude that the way the assets are valued is quite arbitrary so what can we finally conclude from all this that in the case of national cinemedia the cash flow statement is the most reliable indicator of actual business performance the income statement is flawed in such a way that strong earnings are obscured by largely arbitrary amortization expenses this is a company with strong ebit numbers and strong free cash flow possible investing strategies buy and hold types might like this name as a dividend play during the q earnings call cfo katie scherping stated that we intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future if a longterm strategy appeals to you i recommend paying close attention to the leverage ratios and debt covenants as mentioned above the debt levels are higher than most dividend investors like to see in a safe longterm hold alternately i believe this name could work well as an asymmetric shorttomid term turnaround play ceo andy england made the case for such a strategy early in the call we anticipate the first three quarters of  will be challenging while q enabled by content partner spending and star wars will be solid we expect the value of our  transition and investments will be reflected with meaningful activities in digital national spot sales stabilized network along with continued strength in the film slate beginning later this year and into next will drive growth in  and beyond if englands prediction comes to fruition then the q  print could serve as the catalyst the market needs to revalue the stock back to its historical range further with all the pricedin pessimism a positive surprise in q or q could serve as an upside catalyst if you like the odds of any of these shorttomid term events coming to fruition then a long dated call option strategy may achieve superior results while limiting downside exposure disclosure i amwe are long ncmi i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
