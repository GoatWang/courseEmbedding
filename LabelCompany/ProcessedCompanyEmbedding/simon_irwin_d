simon whose father was a kosher butcher is revisiting tradition with the purchase of empire kosher foods what eating healthy foods and keeping kosher have in common is watching what one eats paying attention where the food comes from and how it was raised it would seem the empire kosher would be a logical combination with hain celestials holistic offerings empire was already health conscious as well as kosher and features hormonefree humanely raised antibiotic free poultry in  empire kosher valley which featured sustainably raised fowl hain celestial purchased the  stake of empire kosher for  million it already owned  a stake in empire around   of hain celestial’s offerings even prior to the empire acquisition are kosher irwin simon told marketwatch “empire is a strong brand in a growing category with a lot of experience which provides us with the opportunity to broaden our existing portfolio of organic and natural brands into healthier kosher products empire should leverage hain celestial’s knowhow and infrastructure to pursue new categories and kosher product offerings” irwin simon’s father ran a kosher dairy store in nova scotia he was also a kosher butcher and used to slaughter the meat in the back simon told inc about his childhood “as a family five kids we all worked in the store and my father taught us work ethics how to treat people to work with people” simon

and i am very pleased with that there were no complications with my surgery i would highly recommend dr simon for anyone undergoing surgery andre i sega in las vegas nv  feb  my experience was not a good one dr simon was more worried about what kind of benefits i had and if i would be covered for my testing than what i was actually there to see him for he seemed to be disinterested in using the existing test results i had claiming he didnt trust them when in actuality they were conducted from a reputable source i cant refer anyone to see himboxlady in henderson nv  jan  overall i was pleased with my vein procedure experience  dr simon was very helpful in explaining my vein issues with me  the steps necessary to correct my problem due to the timing of when i initially came to him october

into the market leader in natural foods by hesh kestin write a comment credit an inc profile by hesh kestin my father wasnt a risk taker and that held him back today taking a risk is something im willing to do and thats probably from seeing what my father didnt do in life in  when william wordsworth wrote the child is father of the man how could he not have been thinking of irwin simon in the prime of manhood at  simon runs a company closing in on half a billion dollars in revenues with a market cap twice that up from next to nothing eight years ago yet there is no question not even a lingering doubt that this smooth operator proudly pressing the starter button at nasdaq on the eighth anniversary of his companys ipo surrounded by his top managers the usual anxious pr handlers and the dozen pleased analysts and varicose institutional investors who have benefited from his success as surely as they will turn their backs on him should he falter  no there is not even the shadow of a lingering doubt that this is the same irwin simon stocking bottles of heinz ketchup at age  in his fathers squarefoot grocery in glace bay nova scotia  miles and a lifetime distant from simons park avenue digs and his summer place in the hamptons a grocery that remains always and indelibly a continual reminder of where he comes from and what drives him on glace bay a little fishing village my father had simons dairy a grocery with a candy counter in the back he cut kosher meat as a family five kids we all worked in the store and my father taught us work ethics how to treat people and work with people my father he was probably not a good businessman but ive seen him with people who owed him money  hed give credit and if we didnt have milk in the store that evening he would take money out of the cash register because they had young kids so they could go to another store to buy milk on the other hand i would look at my father as a businessman and id say why arent you doing this why arent you expanding why arent you  even at   years old but my father wasnt a risk taker and that held him back you know if anything today i think taking a risk is always something im willing to do and thats probably from seeing what my father didnt do in life he was a loved man but there were times when i was a kid and i made  in the summer cutting grass  in glace bay it wasnt a long summer i would have to help my father out with that couple thousand dollars when he was overdrawn at the bank simons hain celestial group inc is the market leader in the kind of foods made of stuff that only a decade ago most people didnt consider food at all theyre weird bits of onceorphaned vegetation that have been transmogrified into some  brands and  individual products soy smoothies organic crackers natural cereals that surprise you by tasting good  exquisitely balanced on the other end of the taste scale by a line of fake meat that includes such star trekian improbabilities as veggie breakfast links actually not bad a veggie pizza pepperoni with all the palatability of silly putty and a pure monstrosity called veggie ground round italian a product that manages to simultaneously libel highend hamburger and an entire european country more typical is a panoply of teas that could have been conceived only by people who wear birkenstocks live in windpowered log houses and practice a religion symbolized by a peace sign the size of mama cass but be patient simon doesnt just acquire brands  he revs them up just as the celestial tea line acquired in  for  million was goosed to develop new products and expand internationally that line of meat and cheese analogs  yves veggie cuisine inc acquired last year for  million  will probably undergo an upgrade as well hey hain celestials soy milks and other suspect fluids lead their category because theyve broken new ground in flavor and diversity though from a purely culinary angle they still retain a bit more oo than moo thats simons thing taking the products of already profitable companies improving their taste extending the line and then marketing the hell out of them as they begin the long migration from the shelves of the nations  healthfood stores to its  grocers and  supermarkets the last is often where nonhealthfood addicts bump into some of simons most popular crossover brands like terra chips conceivably the worlds most successful marriage of tubers and hot oil and earths best organic baby food described by one mother as the rollsroyce of toddler stuffing  the latter line acquired from heinz in  as part of a deal in which heinz got a  stake in hain the same heinz whose ketchup little irwin used to stock in glace bay both brands share a label common to hain celestial products kosher sure simons father was a kosher butcher catering to glace bays handful of jewish families but this play is not nostalgic its demographic americas jews and muslims are significant customers at  im off to school in halifax st marys university and i wanted to go there because it was good and it was small i could be effective and just like in high school i was a b and c student but very involved  student council senate ran for president i was paying for my schooling with campuspolice jobs and deskclerk jobs and i became a don in residence in charge of a dorm so that was free housing and being a don the moosehead brewery rep used to give me like  cases of beer each week to give out as samples i said wait a minute i cant give this away  it should now be clear that even then simon was not some kind of burlapshirted nutrition nut whose vision of creating americas leading and most aggressive naturalfoods company would lead accidentally to his taking home more than  million last year in salary bonus and traded shares to say nothing of his ownership of stock worth some  million nope simon  the sight of whom wolfing down a huge steakandpepper hero might send veggie bacon enthusiasts into shock  hardly came to the naturalorganic industry out of ideology he simply observed that the healthfood stores metastasizing in half the malls in america were onto something then parlayed that into an aggressive and wellrun business through shrewdness charm good luck and wisdom gained from a solid apprenticeship in specialty foods in fact the only two brands he worked with before setting off on his own were hendazs which with ben  jerrys actually invented its own unique subniche in specialty foods  call it frozen sin  and slimfast which grew fat sending backsliding highcalorieicecream noshers back to the supermarket for contrition beyond his flair for finance and branding simon was able to recognize that goodforyou doesnt have to taste like it a typical simon product can best be described as the synthesis of sin and atonement in the same shiny wrapper i didnt have the marks to go to law school so i was recruited for an insurance company in sales i spent the summer training but when it came time to write the test i failed i just was not into it i didnt want to do it things happen for a reason six months later i got a job in toronto  my three sisters were living there my father and mother and brother were still in glace bay  at a company that was a canadian licensee for hendazs and did very well with them in sales and marketing so i lived in toronto for three years my family was there and i was living with a lovely woman from a very very wealthy family her father kind of inspired me because he had started out from scratch one day he said you know marry my daughter and you probably wont have to worry the rest of your life  though betterforyou foods is one way simon describes his category no one really knows whether a daily diet of soy smoothies and spelt flakes really improves human innards fed enough of this stuff lab rats may or may not sprout green leaves for ears hain celestials message is thus directed to the cerebrums nodus guiltus eat as much of this stuff as you like because it wont hurt you  and to prove its better note the price i never wanted to be a bought person says simon so when i was offered a job in new york for hendazs i jumped it was just a great move in my career with a telling beginning simon flew to new york to find that his new bosses had neglected to lay on transport to their headquarters in new jersey the airport cabbies wouldnt go there simon noticed a limo driver holding up a sign with someone elses name on it thats me he told the driver that would hardly be the last time simon saw opportunity in taking a ride on an underutilized name simon himself conflates a good name with a good brand in a small town what was important was maintaining the reputation of the family name  thats the thing youll have till death he says many natural and organic foods cost more than their nonorganic cousins but the higher prices often merely reflect the higher costs of smaller and less efficient manufacturing but in this niche a really good brand name even a new one can practically set its own price  regardless of costs a sixounce bag of terra chips  taro cassava sweet potato batata and parsnip  cost this writer  at a new yorkarea supermarket  or about iece the only chips more expensive are made by intel in a supermarket in the hamptons close by simons summer spread any illiterate can pick up a box of namebrand nonorganic pasta for as little as pound it takes a truly discriminating shopper to pay a cool  for a pound of simons deboles organic brand at these prices simons products had better be good for youat these prices theyve certainly been good for irwin simon i was lonely in new york a real hard adjustment i was totally an outsider but at the same time i was not going to give up many nights i put my head down on my pillow and there were tears i missed my family and thought maybe i should scrub this and go back i was   but i loved what i was doing working for a major brand creating growth learning a lot i was maturing  plus i was making american dollars things at hendazs went well i went up through the ranks in sales and marketing working with hendazs in europe running operations for our retail stores but there was just something missing that i couldnt put my finger on i was frustrated i wasnt being challenged things moved much slower than i wanted a new product took two years it was almost as if somebody was in control of my destiny how much i was going to make what i was going to do control is a big part of hain celestial whose gross margin for its last fiscal year was  simon is just plain good at maintaining quality under tight cost controls example hain has just built a plant in new jersey that nearly tripled its production of terra chips using a patented technique for vacuum frying aside from being a great potential enlivener of high school physics and leaving the chips tasting more like a vegetable and less like oilsoaked construction paper the lowtemperature process reduces the amount of fat absorbed by the chips and saves money because the remaining oil lasts longer here in one potato chip is a good deal of the simon savvy better tasting more healthful and produced economically  though in truth the only reason hain celestial produces the chips itself is that it hasnt been able to find quality packers with enough capacity that being the case the company moved quickly to turn the vacuumfrying technology into a profit center by licensing it through a european joint venture in most cases however simon will buy a company with the intention of selling off its manufacturing facilities whose operators often become hains suppliers simon then uses the proceeds to pay down the debt incurred in the acquisition about half the companys production is farmed out and that figure would be  were there enough dependable quality suppliers the other thing is that here i was   and i was going out and terminating people in their fifties which is not only difficult to do  they have kids in college  but you know i didnt want to be there one day in the same situation theyd replace these people with younger people that made less and had a lot more energy and theyd burn those guys out too i said this cant happen to me i went to slimfast though simon has managed to hold on to many managers during his eight years he is not sentimental about making changes among the staff at hain hes on his third chief financial officer for instance but the second is now head of operations simon sitting in his groundfloor long island office which overlooks a parking lot and contains a desk and conference table that appear to be the unsold orphans of some yard sale explains because of our growth we go through people but if people can learn new talents you should help them instead of throwing them out so you move these people around though simon has thrown out plenty a lot more remain to move around the company has grown to  employees with about  of them at its headquarters which recently moved into larger offices near hains former base simon took his lowrent furniture with him  im superstitious thats my lucky desk he says  as well as a recently acquired corporatestyle humanresources director who replaced one who simon felt may have been too friendly with the staff i no longer fire anyone simon says she does slimfast was a fastgrowing brand but totally opposite to hendazs disastrous  no structure no strategic plans you had no authority you had a meeting with the top guy and the next day you would start to do what you were told and hed come back and say why the hell are you doing that you agreed to it and hed say so whyd you listen to me what i learned there went against what i learned from youth people were treated badly slimfast would hire people when things were good  the philosophy was when things get bad well just fire them they would call people over the pa system and everyone knew what it meant come down and be fired they didnt value people  at hain weve never had a reduction in force what i try to do is hold back on hiring until were absolutely stretched  and they didnt value the brand with my father in the store it was campbells soup in that red can that was always in our store and heinz ketchup  these were products you always had to have in the store pillsbury cocacola canada dry they stood for something at slimfast they thought the brand could go on anything and sell salad dressing popcorn cookies probably one of the most valuable things i learned at hendazs was brand equity brand equity slimfast would put their brand on toilet paper if they thought it could sell  worth i hated it rather than growing hain by stretching a single brand until it snaps simon has collected a portfolio of brands sufficiently balanced that should one ship go down it wont sink the fleet he learned that much in  when  of his revenues came from the rice cakes flying off the shelves in the wake of a million marketing blitz by quaker oats co  until the fad collapsed simon believes in gently stretching each brand his earths best baby food now has a line called earths best kidz infants tend to grow but its unlikely hed put the brand on disposable diapers or baby bottles simons brands work more like a patchwork quilt  each piece delicately overlapping the next  than like a jigsaw puzzle on a recent visit to a supermarketsize whole foods healthfood market in manhattan it was actually a trick to walk down an aisle and not bump into hain celestial here soups here cereals here soy milks here cold soy beverages here snacks and here baby foods to dean de santis a whole foods manager that was no secret hain no rival not even close he says everything they put their name on is topnotch and they own everything in  i got married the next  years of my life would be crucial i had to establish myself if i wanted to do it i had to do it now in my thirties i had a severance package if they fired me i would get a year i tried everything to get pushed out so at the same time i was at slimfast i was looking for a job just in case i was looking for a business deal and i was looking to get fired which you had to do right because it couldnt be for cause my plan was to find a business find products find brands find money  and  was rough times in the end simon didnt have to find another job he got fired  his former boss was recently surprised to learn that that had not been slimfasts idea  and found his business actually several businesses a company making soy ice cream and soy meat pockets a line of soy pizza a tiny weightloss competitor to slimfast and a company selling frozen kosher foods only the last was profitable i thought if i can put these businesses together and generate  million to  million in revenues enough cash flow to pay the bills and take these brands and grow them so i took my own money and put down deposits on each one and i went out and sold my story to these people that i was going to raise money and build this big company that i knew what i was doing that i was a great marketer that i was a great visionary and i guess it worked because people liked me and had confidence in me but really i didnt have a clue id never before had to worry about money because i had worked for companies with deep pockets i never had to raise money i never had to meet payroll but i convinced all four of these people that i had the other companies and that i had the money next i had to go raise the money knocked on the doors of banks vc firms everywhere  they all absolutely thought i was just whacked out ah the satisfactions of success fleet bank which wouldnt lend irwin simon  after he had risked everything he owned  gutting his  in savings and mortgaging his apartment for another   recently competed to hand hain celestial a line of credit worth  million that early period in the capitalizationfree zone no doubt explains two things about simon a why his company is virtually debtless and b why he spends up to a third of his time taking care of shareholders and the analystssoothsayers who now consider hain celestial a buy but tomorrow might shift it to hold  or worse when he heard that one new york analyst was in a quandary about private schooling for her child simon invited her to call his wife daryls been through that  she knows it all he told her simon knows what its like to gasp for cash when he finally got a small underwriter to do a public offering all that was left after the costs of acquisition underwriting accounting and legal fees and repaying bridge loans was about   a pittance on aggregate annual sales of  million the new company with its four brands was bleeding  once i went public i got rid of all these people all this overhead and in the first couple of months i turned it profitable we needed to sell more and tighten up meanwhile i knew we had to get bigger  so where was the next risk there was a company called hain pure food co  a great name around since   which was up for sale by pet inc hain pure food had  million in revenues lo and behold i was out there in st louis bidding  and i was the last bidder i convinced pet a billion company to sell it to me me with this little public company and i sold them that i can do it i can raise the money and all im thinking on the plane back is how the hell am i going to get  million  at this point the past rolls quickly into the present on hain pure food we sold bonds and a bank put up  million when they shouldnt have given me simon says with future acquisitions the technique would be the same though the numbers would keep going up over the next six years in order to acquire companies simon would sell equity or borrow and then cut costs and sell off manufacturing facilities then hed improve and expand the brand and push it into new markets that bank was right after all simon did know what he was doing but each time he took a risk there was more at stake every time i went out and did another deal i risked the company because i was borrowing  million to  million and i never cashed out the question that always came back always was do i just stay this small little company do i have a bigger percentage of the company or do i go out and take a risk by putting more debt on the company and become bigger with the chance of it all blowing up he says and i always just felt bigger is better and i always knew i was betting the firm but isnt there some point where it is stupid to bet the firm in bumperstickerese organic waste happens simons biggest acquisition celestial seasonings inc brought a whiff of just that when hains due diligence failed to reveal that celestials sales channels were overstuffed bad enough that those heightened revenues may have encouraged simon to overpay but with celestials distributors holding too much product the tea lines sales quickly dropped as did hains share price and simons net worth still worse things could happen for all the variety of its products hain celestial is essentially a onetrick naturalorganic pony according to nutrition business journal growth rates for this sector are expected to slip steadily from a  high of  to  in   in  and  in  should this trend bump into a long deep recession simon could take a hit now consider the hypothetical worst in the midst of an e coli scare what happens when  minutes does a nasty piece on the kinds of fertilizer that make produce organic in the first place lordy there must be some point where it really is stupid to bet the firm simons mouth softens for a moment he looks away and at once you know that he is back in glace bay carefully arranging those bottles of heinz ketchup and his father is in the back cutting meat for the passover rush and outside the nova scotian wind is whipping up off the north atlantic and little irwin is thinking about growth and risk and growth and risk and why his father refuses to take that risk and then finally it comes out the grown man saying it saying it straight out with the kind of relief his own father must have known that there is a point in life where no gain is worth the loss of what you have little as it is big as it is today says irwin simon it would be stupid to bet the firm in just a week simon is off to europe to close a million deal for a belgian company  lima nv  whose ceo philippe woitrin admires the aggressive businessman who is irwin simon irwin irwin is a pusher woitrin says just before simon leaves  adult male jews convene in an office overlooking a long island

marketing arena by stewart ainapril   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story since he founded the hain food group in uniondale in  irwin d simon has guided the concern from that of a small natural and specialty food consolidator to a marketer of more than  niche food products under  brand namesmr simon the companys president and chief executive officer received the entrepreneur of the year award last year from ernst  young after increasing the companys sales from  million in  to  million last year the son of a local retailstore owner mr simon was born in glace bay canada his first job in  was as assistant product manager of william neilsen ltd in toronto a large food conglomerate where he worked on the haagendazs ice cream account in  pillsbury bought haagendazs and recruited him to work for it in new york where he stayed until  working in sales marketing business development and retail shops for the next yearandahalf simon worked as vice president of sales and marketing for slimfast foods he then started his own company he is married and has one childq why did you start your own businessa i had a vision of wanting to buy companies with niche brands and niche categories a lot of people talk about it a lot of people want to do it and there are some who do itq whya because i saw nobody doing it i saw nobody taking kosher foods medically directed foods health foods to the next level when we acquired kineret the packaging was thcentury packaging when i went to them and said we have to do lowfat and betterforyou foods they said nobody would eat them advertisement continue reading the main story q the people at kineret didnt believe ita they didnt and they didnt believe in spending money on advertising packaging or anything like that my philosophy was that if i bought a lot of small companies and brought the lessons i learned in corporate america my strategic vision and the entrepreneurealship that i had growing up as a kid and being in a family business that i could take all these little businesses to the next level they had not shown up on the screen of the big guys yet the big guys were not there continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q they didnt have these productsa right there was no big multifood company in the kosher food business the natural food business the medically directed food business and so i felt i couldnt get stomped on because there was no one thereq and what was the vision you said you hada my vision was making foods that taste good that were healthier types of food  whether they were low in fat lower in saturated fat lower in sodium foods for diabetics foods for people who kept kosher foods that only had natural ingredientsq and now products must contain a label with a listing of ingredientsa thats what really set me apart in  the nutritional labeling laws came into effect and everything became standardized that went in my favor because now people knew the percentage of saturated fat and how much sodium there was in there someone could call a product healthy but what were the calories we tell people read our labels read our ingredients were proud of whats in it so i wanted to build brands and provide foods that were better for youq what else was importanta i didnt want to be a manufacturer or own brick and mortar and build plants and stuff like that i like to keep things simple in my life and if i could concentrate on building a brand and let someone else manufacture these products for me under my formulas and recipes  and i had strict quality assurance in place  that was my strategy all the money i ever saved i put into this businessq did you borrow as wella i mortgaged my apartment and my wife is still working i took a big risk because i walked away from a sixfigure job i had no income and put my life on hold i was married two or three years and didnt want to have children because i had no income and the more people told me i was crazy that it wouldnt work the harder i workedq why did people think you were crazy what you were doing is called food consolidation righta well nobody ever really did it in the betterforyou category  in healthier foods i was the first and i was trying to do it with not a lot of money newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a

preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime q how did you go about ita in my first year i bought four little companies  kineret farm foods pizsoy and california slim and i tried to take all of these four and merge them together why so they would have enough cash flow to pay some of the bills and people said that most people have trouble doing one acquisition youll never be able to pull four off so throughout the year i cant tell you how many times a deal was almost dead or how many times a bank slammed the door in my face as i tried to find the financing to acquire the companies i had deals with every one of them to go ahead and acquire them and i gave them money out of my own pocket that i would have lost if i couldnt get the necessary financingq so how did you finally pull it offa i found a small underwriter on long island lew liberbaum who took me public and raised me  million we went public in november  and after i paid off my debts i had  left so i knew i had to do something bigger a week after i closed on my initial public offering pet a large conglomerate was selling the hain hollywood division a  million division i flew to st louis to negotiate this deal with a letter from one of my investment banker friends that said i could raise  million and i won the bid and then went out and raised  million so in april  i acquired hain hollywood advertisement continue reading the main story q how did you manage all of thisa i had no infrastructure and hain was a business in st louis with a product line i operated out of the back of the kineret warehouse in jerichoq when did you move to uniondalea in august  and in our first year of owning hain we paid back  million of our debt in november  we bought estee from a large german company by again going out and borrowing the moneyq and you bought the licensing rights to weight watchers gourmet foods in march  so where do you see your future growth  in acquisitions or through the purchase of more licensing rightsa the no  way we grow is through new products and new distribution estee is a food product line for the diabetic as you know drug stores sell a lot of food and the no  perscription sold in a drugstore today is insulin but estee is not in drugstores yet so we have a big opportunity with drugstores we also have a big opportunity to expand hains weight watchers and others acquisitions are a big part of our growth were looking at acquisitions all the time and want to grow more through acquisitions than strategic alliances weight watchers is a great product line for us but we dont own the brand we want to own our brands we want to be a property owner not a property managerq a big part of your growth will be with organic foodsa yes over  percent of our westbrae products are organic and  or  percent of hain products are organic so we see a big growth in organic products diabetic products weight management products and kosher productsq what did you learn from your days with big companiesa to be expedient in doing things we came out with  new products in one year with hain when i worked in the big companies it would take us seven years to come out with  new products so strategic marketing being a visionary and making things happen quickly all came from big company experienceq in the future i understand you are looking at breakfast foods and baby productsa our companys natural foods today control six of the top  categories we want to introduce a lot of prepared meals for kids and were working on some prepared breakfasttype products wed like to go into baby food if we could find the right strategic acquisition what we want to do is introduce babies to organic or healthy food first and you bring new users into baby foods every nine months what we want to do then is introduce them into hain kids products i have a  yearold daughter and we have animal crackers in which there are no artificial colors flavors or preservatives and there is not a lot of sugar in this and its great for kidsq do you want your products in health food stores or supermarketsa both the natural food stores are great stores supermarkets today are also putting natural foods or betterforyou sections within their store and we want to be located in that section of the store i do not want my cookies in with keebler or nabisco cookies i want them in the natural food or betterforyou aisle when you are in specialty foods people are brand loyal when you mention a frozen challah the first thing that comes to your mind is kineret continue reading the main
