ipos in which mfs chose to participate in the period february   through september   had a very high probability of having a high return and little probability of having a negative return supports my finding of mr bacarellas ability to select successful ipos tr  resp ex  at exhibit  in addition to professor womack professor john c coffee jr testified on behalf of the division their testimony established that on average investors who received ipo shares at the offering price almost certainly profited i accept as accurate the following representation by professor womack ipo shares are investment opportunities of limited availability customers desire and aggressively compete for allocations of such shares this is for a very simple reason ipo shares are priced on average to appreciate immediately on the first day and those accounts receiving the shares at the offering price garner instant firstday profits for example in the time period  to  the average firstday return    on all us ipos was  from offering price to the opening day trade price however it is not the case that all ipos increase  on the first day in recent years it has not been uncommon for some offerings about  to increase  to  or more on the first day on the other hand roughly one quarter of offerings have a  return or less on the first day ie the ipo stock price closes the first day at or below the offering price nevertheless a representative sample of all ipo shares increased  in the  time period in question februaryseptember     the first important conclusion is that investors who receive these firstday ipo returns through underwriters allocation gifts are substantially advantaged in any investment competition it is important to note that investors cannot buy these returns in aftermarket trading the immediate return is earned only by those investors who receive shares at the offering price from the underwriter aftermarket trading the first opportunity for investors who are not offered shares by the underwriter begins on average after the  increase footnote omitted underlining and italics in original div ex  at  by the term gift professor womack meant the onaverage positive ipo returns as in the ones mfs received which were paid for with past and more importantly future commissions tr  a  study showed that approximately  of the initial days mean return is earned on the opening transaction div ex  at  n citing c barry and r jennings the opening price performance of initial public offerings of common stock  financial management spring  this indicates that those who receive the ipo allocations capture virtually all of the firstdays gains div ex  at  hot ipos i reject respondents position that an ipo cannot be characterized as hot until after it trades at a premium in the secondary market mfs and bacarella answer at  the overwhelming evidence is that  the designation hot ipo can be made before the initial trading occurs and  mr bacarella an informed investor could predict accurately within a range which ipos on average would likely be the hottest and best firstday investments before secondary trading began tr    div ex  at   john m alogna a senior vice president in the global value equities department of putnam investments who was portfolio manager of the midcap fund in  defined a hot ipo as an offering that was expected to start trading at substantially higher prices than the offering price tr  knowledgeable persons apply several factors when characterizing an ipo as hot very hot or cold one strong indicator is the ratio of indications of interest or buyers orders adjusted for inflation to the size of the offering ie the oversubscription rate tr   some argue that an offering that is four or five times oversubscribed is cold while others would consider it hot tr   professor womack opined that a hot deal may be oversubscribed by five times or more while the coldest issues may have just sufficient demand to accommodate the offering size div ex  at  an offering would be considered pretty hot or very hot where the indications of interest were four or more times the size of the offering and where the proposed offering price had accelerated upwards through several amendments of the prospectus tr   the projected offering price can increase several times prior to the offering where the ipo is extremely hot tr  contrary to the law of supply and demand price increases in the offering price of ipos do not reduce indications of interest tr  professor womack found that the oversubscription ratio on a number of deals done by montgomery securities montgomery was a very good predictor of the openingday returns tr  professor hanley agreed it was possible to predict that some ipos would have better than average initial returns based on research that showed that higher returns occurred in ipos where the offering price is high relative to the file range tr  professor womack has found an ipos announced price relative to the initial price talk range to be an accurate preoffering demand indicator div ex  at  in his study the persistence of ipo mispricing and the predictive power of flipping professor womack concluded that the more the offering price has been raised from the midpoint of the initial filing range midtooffer the more the shares are likely to be above average performers in the aftermarket div ex  at  an early study by professor hanley entitled the underpricing of initial public offerings and the partial adjustment phenomenon reached a similar result div ex  factors that indicate whether an ipo is hot before secondary market trading begins are orders far exceeding the amount of shares to be sold the breadth of interest among potential buyers the initial price talk range relative to the offering price and the level and the quality of institutional demand ie whether the potential buyers are considered flippers rather than investors tr  div ex  at  div ex  at  a flipper is someone who intends to sell a security shortly after acquiring it for a relatively riskless profit tr  div ex  at  mfs flipped the ipos at issue here tr    div ex  at  the evidence supports professor coffees characterization of the allocation of hot ipos as the dispensing of free money and professor womacks view that ipo allocations are a gift because they bestow a clear benefit on the recipient div ex  at   div ex  at   professor womack and richard a smith were persuasive that the majority of offerings labeled hot before the ipo occurs perform as hot offerings in the aftermarket tr   div ex  at  mr bacarellamfss distribution of ipo allocations in  mfss clients generated total commissions of  to seven brokerdealers bear stearns  co inc goldman sachs  co montgomery morgan stanley  co ragan mackenzie robertson stephens  co lp and volpe welty  co div ex  mfss funds clients generated approximately  of these commissions tr   div ex  div ex  at  in  one of these brokerdealers montgomery allocated to mfs  shares of several ipos tr  the allocation process occurred in the following manner early on the day the ipo was scheduled to go public a montgomery sales trader usually martha georgeson who handled the mfs account called and told mfs the offering price and allotment for ipos where mfs had submitted an indication of interest tr   based on that conversation nancy boeselager a mfs trader found out from mr bacarella before  pm which mfs clients would receive the allocation and relayed that information to ms georgeson at montgomery tr   ms georgeson initialed a representation on the trade order buy ticket that stated that the sale did not violate the national association of securities dealers nasd freeriding and withholding interpretation freeriding rule the following statement that ms georgeson initialed on the buy order for the  shares of papa johns international inc ipo is typical of what appeared on all the buy orders at issue i have made inquiry and am informed that no one with a beneficial interest in the above accounts are in the restricted category of para  thru  of the nasd freeriding  withholding regulations tr  div ex a the objective of the nasds freeriding rule is to ensure a bona fide distribution to the public nasd manual im at  july  div ex  at  among other things the rule prohibits a brokerdealer from selling to a person who may influence investment decisions of a mutual fund or investment adviser div ex  at  when she signed the statement ms georgeson believed that mfs had affirmed that it would not make an allocation that violated the freeriding rule tr  ms georgeson testified that if she had known that mfs was going to allocate the ipo shares to fund directors and trustees she would not have signed the statement and would have referred the issue to montgomerys compliance department because directors receiving ipos raised a red flag as they could be considered insiders tr  ms boeselager at mfs does not recall ms georgeson making such an inquiry tr  mfs had between  and  client accounts in  but only the funds and about twenty other clients were eligible to receive the ipo allocations that mfs received from montgomery tr    to be eligible for an ipo allocation mfs required that the client have an account at the old kent bank old kent and have sufficient funds in the account tr    certain people at mfs indicated what ipos they thought mfs should try to acquire for its clients for example mr alogna gave traders indications of interest for certain ipos on behalf of the midcap fund tr   when mfs received an ipo allocation however mr bacarella alone decided which mfs clients would receive the ipo shares tr    mr alogna did not know how mr bacarella allocated ipos tr  in  mfs did not charge an advisory fee to certain accounts such as nonwrap accounts with less than  in assets the bond fund or the government money market fund tr  mfs did not charge an advisory fee to mr valiant mr henry or mr russo because their accounts were less than  tr    following industry practice montgomery did not require that mfs identify what customer accounts would receive the allocation when it notified mfs of the number of shares it would receive tr  div ex  at   mr bacarella made some allocations after the ipo opened and trading began in the secondary market tr  when he did so mr bacarella knew he was giving the directorstrustees a profit since the majority of price appreciation occurs at the opening trade in the secondary market div ex  at  during the relevant period mfs participated in fiftyone ipos underwritten by montgomery div ex  at  mfsmr bacarella allocated some of these ipos to both the funds and the directorstrustees of the funds and some ipos only to the funds and some ipos only to the directorstrustees of the funds div ex  at   the ipos mr bacarella chose for mfs did significantly better than the average ipo in the relevant period using a returntoopen measure professor womack defines returntoopen as the difference between the share price when the offering opens for trading and the underwriters issue price div ex  at  the returntoopen for all ipos in the relevant period was  div ex  at  the returntoopen for the ipos that mfs received and distributed to the funds were on average about  and the ipos distributed to the directorstrustees averaged  div ex  at  this evidence is persuasive that it was not by chance that mr bacarella selected ipos that appreciated in value on the first day more than double that of the average ipo rather these results show that mr bacarella

fiduciaries should be loyal to their beneficiaries the duty of loyalty is implicit in the nature of the relationship the fiduciary acts for the benefit of the beneficiary and the beneficiary must

the monetta trust directors ended on january   when people were leaving or had left the meeting tr   according to mr bacarella he asked ms olsen whether mr russo and mr valiant could continue to receive allocations of ipos now that they were trustees and she told him it was allowed inasmuch as they were not officers or employees of mfs tr  mr bacarella offered no explanation as to why he waited to pose such an important question until the meeting was over and mr valiant mr russo and the other directors as well as the person in charge of compliance were not present to hear the question and answer the timing of mr bacarellas alleged question to counsel makes his testimony suspect ms olsens testimony is that she did not know until november  that mfs was allocating ipos to either mr henry mr valiant or mr russo tr   ms olsen has no recollection of the conversation that mr bacarella contends took place on january   and she does not believe that it occurred tr  i find ms olsens version of these events to be credible for a number of reasons ms olsen claims that if she had been asked such a question she would have needed more information before responding i dont think that question can be answered without knowing more i dont think i know the answer to that question today because there are things that i dont know i dont know the basis for  i think one would have to know the basis for allocation one would have to know what the underlying client relationship was those are the things that come immediately to mind as things that would have to be known in order to answer the question that supposedly was posed    any time youre talking about allocations you have to know on what basis those allocations are being made tr  also the only confirmation of mr bacarellas version of events came from two mfs employees maria cesario denicolo and valerie lefevre the validity of this corroborating testimony is suspect because these witnesses are mfs employees whose livelihoods are tied to mr bacarellas continued success and the circumstances they described are peculiar ms denicola a certified public accountant left the accounting firm of which she was the sole proprietor to join mfs as controller in june  div ex  at  in july  when she testified ms denicola was certified financial officer secretarytreasurer and compliance officer of mfs tr  in  ms denicola

is very upset that it has been charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities statutes tr  according to ms denicola she overheard ms olsen tell mr bacarella that mr valiant could continue getting ipos because he was not an officer or employee while she was cleaning the room following the first meeting of the monetta trust on january   tr  mr valiant mr rozinsky and the other persons who attended the meeting were not present when the conversation allegedly occurred tr  ms lefevre has worked for mfs since  tr  in  she was employed by mfs and was secretary of the monetta

was an employee of the adviser but that ms olsen said mr valiant could receive ipo allocations tr  no one else was present to hear the conversation tr  i do not accept ms lefevres testimony as true because she claims mr rozinsky gave her information which he did not have at the time mr rozinsky made several contradictory statements under oath as to when he learned mfs was allocating ipos to the directorstrustees tr  i find mr rozinskys  investigative testimony to be the persuasive version of events because it was given closer in time to when the events occurred and before people began formulating defenses to the allegations in his  testimony mr rozinsky denied knowing that any directorstrustees of the funds received ipos until after october   so that mr rozinsky could not have made

or industry practice mfs and bacarella br at  mfs and mr bacarella emphasize that there was no statute rule or regulation in  which prescribed how an investment adviser should allocate ipos between and among its clients mfs and bacarella br at  the issue however is not simply the allocation but the failure to disclose the allocation before deciding whether respondents were required to disclose this information it is necessary to consider first whether the investment companies their shareholders and prospective shareholders would consider the information material i resolve this issue in the affirmative because there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision that the funds adviser was giving investment opportunities

doctrines the adviser must distribute ipo allocations in an equitable manner the overwhelming evidence is that mfs did not do so rather mr bacarella distributed these sought after opportunities to maximize the benefits to the business enterprise he operated the adviser tr   div ex  div ex  at   on these facts mr bacarellas claim that he allocated ipos to respondents valiant henry and russo

charge an advisory fee he also knew that respondents valiant henry and russo did little trading in these accounts and that these accounts did not generate any of the commissions paid to montgomery tr  div ex  at  as professor coffee correctly noted the fiduciary duty an adviser owes its clients does not include the duty to allocate ipos to trivial accounts tr  the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the evidence is that mfs and mr bacarella allocated ipos to respondents valiant henry and russo because these directors could further the business interests of mr bacarella and mfs a major responsibility of fund directorstrustees is to review the companys operation to evaluate the performance of its portfolio and its adviser frankel supra at  this oversight function could be impaired or unduly influenced where the directorstrustees receive gifts from the adviser for this reason mfsmr bacarella created a conflict of interest situation by allocating shares of ipos to directorstrustees of the funds to which mfs was the adviser the allocation of ipos to the directorstrustees inured to the benefit of mfsmr bacarella rather than to the benefit of the funds mfs and mr bacarella therefore violated the duty of loyalty they owed as fiduciaries by making the allocation and not disclosing their conflicts of interest the commission has affirmed as hornbook law that a fiduciary

allocations to the funds and their shareholders mr bacarella caused mfss violations because he controlled the advisers actions and he made the allocations tr  mr bacarella individually owed an independent fiduciary duty to the funds as an officer and a directortrustee professor womacks testimony and exhibits demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that mr bacarella distributed a portfolio of superior ipos to the respondent directorstrustees  higher mean return and lower standard deviation risk  than the ipo portfolio he distributed to the funds tr   the statistical evidence is persuasive that mr bacarella on balance intentionally allocated ipos to mr valiant mr henry and mr russo that he knew or had every reason to expect would be more profitable and posed less risk than the ipos he distributed to the funds and on balance he intentionally distributed to the funds ipos that he knew or had every reason to expect would be less profitable than those he distributed to the named directorstrustees tr     the following facts established in the record support this conclusion mr bacarella knew before secondary trading began that on average the thirteen ipos he allocated to mr valiant mr henry and mr russo during the relevant period would be hot offerings tr  div ex  mr bacarella did not distribute any cold ipos to mr valiant mr henry or mr russo but he did distribute cold ipos to the monetta fund and the monetta trust tr  div ex  at   mfs distributed ipos to mr valiant mr henry and mr russo that were about  more profitable than the ipos it distributed to the funds

indemand ipos because on average these are the best longterm investments tr  div ex  at  for this reason in professor womacks analysis the lowest rather than the highest flipping activity ratio indicates the best ipos in terms of longterm performance tr   for the period february to september  the average flipping activity ratio was  for the ipos allocated to directorstrustees  for the ipos allocated to the funds and  for all ipos div ex  at table  part c professor womack has made a persuasive presentation that by both the midtooffer and returntoopen measures the ipos mr bacarella distributed to the directorstrustees were significantly more attractive than the ipos he distributed to the funds div ex  at  similarly professor womacks expert opinion that these results did not occur by chance is based on unrefuted statistical analysis div ex  at   the mathematical calculations detailed above which are supported by expert witness testimony make a statistically significant inference that supports a finding that mr bacarella knowingly and willfully distributed ipos that had or appeared to have had the best chance of earning the highest return the hottest performing ipos to mr henry mr russo and mr valiant who as board members were positioned to help the adviser rather than to the funds tr    div ex  at   statistically significant means with that there is a high probability  that the result did not occur by chance tr  the individual analyses of midtooffer returntoopen and flipping activity ratio produce positively correlated results tr  these results and the subscription ratios provide robust statistical evidence to support professor womacks conclusions tr   respondents claim that the distribution was proper because the monetta fund the midcap fund and the bond fund received  of the ipo shares allocated while the directorstrustees received only  resp ex  this argument is unpersuasive for several reasons  there was no justification for allocating any ipos to these directorstrustees  the number of shares is irrelevant it is the return that is significant and the return on the ipos allocated to directorstrustees was significantly higher  there is no evidence to support mr bacarellas claim that he followed a guideline which he modified to account for among other things subchapter m of the internal revenue code and  there is no evidence that supports mr bacarellas claim that he distributed ipos equitably among all eligible mfs clients based on information provided to him by tim cekal a mfs employee who informed him what accounts had received prior ipo allocations and which accounts had sufficient cash available to make them eligible to purchase an ipo tr       moreover the testimony of john alogna and james boves portfolio managers of the midcap fund and the bond fund respectively does not support mr bacarellas claim that these funds were not interested in the ipos he allocated to respondents mr boves accepted ipos that were going to be flipped which mr bacarella or mr alogna offered and he probably would have taken more if they had been offered tr  mr boves a monetta trust trustee would have questioned the legality of a trustee receiving ipo allocations if he had known of mfss allocations to mr russo and mr valiant tr  mr alogna did not indicate he would have refused allocations of more ipos than he received if they were suitable for the midcap fund tr   finally even if there was a legitimate basis for allocating ipos to the directorstrustees there was no legitimate basis for deliberately allocating the superior ipos to the directorstrustees and there was absolutely no justification for not disclosing what was clearly a conflict of interest by the adviser to the funds their investors and potential investors respondents seem to believe that the allegations represent an attempt to impose new standards on a business enterprise however the evidence is compelling that respondents were engaged in selfserving conduct that violated long established principles professor coffee accurately noted full and fair disclosure of material information is the oldest and most basic obligation under the federal securities laws div ex  at  among other things respondents cite a  industry survey that revealed that only  of fund complexes restricted ipo investing by either personnel of the adviser or fund directors as proof that their actions followed industry practice mfs and bacarella br at  resp ex  respondents evidence and arguments do not establish that it was common industry practice for fund directors to accept hot ipos from the funds adviser without disclosure even if there was evidence that such a practice existed it would not be controlling see doe v cutter biological inc  fd   th cir  citations omitted i reject respondents criticisms of professor womacks conclusions i also reject their experts finding that no significant difference exists between the mean returns of the portfolios of the funds visàvis the portfolios of the directorstrustees professor womack effectively rebutted respondents position that the variables he used were not independent that application of the bootstrapping test was inappropriate and that the powersoft ipo was an outlier that skewed the results tr    i find unpersuasive statistical analysis presented by professor hanley to rebut professor womacks presentation professor hanley used a common statistical measure known as the difference in means test or t test as part of her analysis tr   resp ex  the evidence raises significant doubt about the propriety of using the t test in this situation because it requires assumptions that are not true the population was not normally distributed the two samples being compared were not randomly selected and they were not chosen independently tr  respondents rely on the holding in santa fe indus v green  us at  to support their position that the division is trying to stretch the federal securities laws to address corporate law issues covered by state law this is not true santa fe is distinguishable on its facts in santa fe minority shareholders objected to a merger conducted by the majority shareholders under the provisions of delawares shortform merger statute their main complaint was that  per share stock price they were offered was too low rather than pursuing the issue of valuation in the delaware court of chancery as the statute provided the minority shareholders brought an action in district court action alleging a violation of section b of the exchange act and rule b thereunder the court found that there had been complete disclosure of the material facts unlike santa fe here material facts were not disclosed the subjects of this proceeding are a registered investment adviser and officers andor directors of registered investment companies and the issue is the legality of their activities under federal statutes see lw laird v integrated resources inc  fd   th cir  furthermore concerning entanglement with state law because our holding encompasses a developed federal standard it does not require reference to state corporate and securities law or the state law of fiduciary relationships the supreme court has recognized the investment advisers fiduciary status footnotes omitted it is perhaps most important that in santa fe unlike here there was no deception misrepresentation or nondisclosure santa fe indus v green  us at  i therefore conclude that the holding in santa fe is inapplicable to this situation mfss distribution of ipos to directorstrustees of the funds without disclosure to the other directors trustees or shareholders of the funds was a conflict of interest and a breach of fiduciary duty that violated the antifraud provisions of the securities statutes specifically by these actions mfs and mr bacarella employed a scheme to defraud in offering and selling shares of the funds without disclosing material information in the funds official filings they obtained money by means of untrue and misleading information and they engaged in a course of business which operated as a fraud on purchasers of the funds shares in making this determination it is relevant that mr bacarella possessed all the attributes which indicate that he was aware of the implications of his actions a high level of formal education in the field of business over twenty years experience in the securities industry success in managing investments and a reputation for high ethical standards tr   mr bacarellas lack of candor and his attempts to hide his actions support my finding that he acted with the intent to deceive for example mr bacarella did not tell mr rozinsky that he was allocating ipos to the directorstrustees he did not inform the other directors or shareholders of the monetta fund of the allocation to mr henry or the trustees or shareholders of the monetta trust of the allocations to mr valiant and mr russo he did not seek a formal written opinion from outside legal counsel he did not raise the subject for discussion at quarterly board meetings where legal counsel was present and when the commissions examiners questioned him as to how mr valiant managed to obtain ipos he lied tr      at the very minimum mr bacarellas conduct was an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care and thus he acted recklessly hollinger v titan capital corp  fd   th cir  en banc messrs henry russo and valiant mr valiant and mr henry have never denied that they each received four ipo allocations over periods of approximately sixty days and that they profited by  and  respectively they contend that the amounts were inconsequential that this was not material information for funds shareholders that they did not act with scienter and that their conduct did not violate any state or common law practice but rather followed industry practice and custom at the time henry and valiant br at  i find that respondents henry russo and valiant breached the fiduciary duties including the duty of loyalty owed to the funds on whose boards they served because they knowingly accepted portions of hot ipo allocations from mfs without disclosing this fact to the funds its shareholders and its prospective shareholders tr  respondents conduct amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty because by accepting these ipos they put their personal interests ahead of the best interests of the funds and their shareholders and they did so without receiving the consent of the funds and their shareholders see sec v capital gains research bureau inc  us at  frankel supra at  mr henry and mr russo acted with scienter each established a bank account for discretionary trades by mfsmr bacarella each received confirmations and account statements from old kent showing the ipo trades by mfsmr bacarella in their accounts mr russos claims that in  he did not know what an ipo was and he did not know that mr bacarella was flipping ipos in his account because he only looked at his confirmations and old kent statements at the end of the year are not valid defenses tr   rather this conduct indicates that mr russo acted recklessly as a director and audit committee member mr russo was a fund fiduciary he gave the funds adviser discretion to handle transactions in his personal account and did not bother to check whether the activity was proper tr  the evidence is persuasive that these respondents engaged in what on its face is blatantly improper professional behavior because they wanted to make money for all the reasons stated i find that respondents henry and russo violated the antifraud provisions of the securities statutes because in the relevant period they accepted hot ipos and did not disclose this fact to those to whom they owed a fiduciary duty by this conduct these respondents engaged in a scheme to defraud in offering and selling shares of the funds they obtained money by means of untrue and misleading material information and they engaged in a course of business that operated as a fraud on purchasers of funds shares i do not find that mr valiant violated the antifraud provisions because the evidence is not persuasive that he acted with scienter or that he was negligent negligence is a departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent person under like circumstances the law of negligence is founded on reasonable conduct or reasonable care under all circumstances of a particular case blacks law dictionary  th ed  based on my observation of the witness i judge mr valiant to have given credible testimony unlike the other respondents mr valiants testimony was responsive forthright and consistent unlike the other respondents there is nothing in the record that indicates mr valiant ever tried to conceal that he was receiving ipos from mfs mr valiant submitted reports to mr rozinsky disclosing his securities transactions including the ipo transactions in his old kent account tr  under these circumstances i conclude that mr valiant acted reasonably in relying on mr bacarellas implicit representations that the activities he proposed for mr valiant were legal and proper i conclude that mr bacarella took advantage of mr valiant a person with considerable credibility in the business community q did you believe that your acceptance of these ipo allocations into your old kent account was somehow a wrongful taking of an opportunity that belonged to the trust a it never occurred to me that there was  nobody ever brought up the fact that there was anything wrong with having an account i never  im relying on bobs practice of dotting every i and crossing every t and checking with legal counsel every step of the way not only when he first formed the monetta fund but every step of the way in his career which i think he had a lot of training at borgwarner to do his homework and touch all bases and particularly touch the bases with legal counsel when there are so many regulations involved tr  mr valiant has substantial personal assets and an outstanding record of contributions to the community he had observed mr bacarellas success managing investments with borgwarner and then as an independent adviser tr  he was pleased and proud that mr bacarella a younger man whom he respected asked him to serve as a trustee and he had reasonable grounds to believe that the actions mr bacarella advised him to take were legal tr   did mfs willfully violate section  and section  of the advisers act by not disclosing to the funds the funds shareholders and possible investors the allocation of hot ipos to certain directors and trustees and did mr bacarella cause and willfully aid and abet these violations by mfs section  and section  of the advisers act were modeled on the antifraud provisions of the securities act and the exchange act and they should receive a similar interpretation frankel supra at  a breach by the adviser of the undivided duty of loyalty that it owes the client may constitute a fraud within the meaning of sections  and  of the advisers act as well as a violation of the antifraud provisions of the securities act and the exchange act frankel supra at  citing sec v capital gains  us at    louis loss securities regulation  d ed  section  of the advisers act requires a showing of scienter see steadman v sec  fd   th cir  sec v steadman  fd at   nn   however section  of the advisers act does not require a showing that the adviser acted with scienter to impose    the burden of showing deliberate dishonesty as a condition precedent to protecting investors through the prophylaxis of disclosure would effectively nullify the protective purposes of the statute     the statute in recognition of the advisers fiduciary relationship to his clients requires that his advice be disinterested to ensure this it empowers the courts to require disclosure of material facts     the high standards of business morality exacted by our laws regulating the securities industry do not permit an investment adviser to trade on the market effect of his own recommendations without fully and fairly revealing his personal interests in these recommendations to his clients sec v capital gains  us at   i find that mfs willfully violated section  and section  of the advisers act for all the reasons that supported my findings in connection with section a of the securities act section b of the exchange act and rule b thereunder aiding and abetting violations of the securities laws involve three elements i a primary violation by another party ii awareness or knowledge by the aider and abettor that his or her role was part of an overall activity that was improper and iii that the

reporting requirements on the access persons of registered investment companies and the investment advisers and principal underwriters of these investments companies as a director of a registered

its obligations under the investment advisers act    the securities exchange act     nothing herein shall be construed to require duplicate or additional records div ex  at c henry proposed findings at  mr henry argues that because mfs and mr bacarella knew about his ipo transactions the above language nullifies his reporting requirement this argument is unpersuasive because language in the monetta fund code does not relieve mr henry of his obligation under rule j the fact that an investment adviser might have information or maintain a record does not relieve an interested director from his obligation to file a report required of him by rule j i find that mr henrys violation of rule j was willful for several reasons willfulness means no more than intentionally committing the act that

by asking the advice of knowledgeable people whether he should include the ipos on the report conflicts with all the other evidence that indicates that he operated surreptitiously the unanimous

with either ms olsen or mr rozinsky counsel and compliance director respectively for the funds and mfs who were present at every directors meeting tr    mr rozinsky and mr henry had both been

positions respondents mfs and mr bacarella contend that even if the allegations occurred the measures recommended by the division are not necessary or appropriate in the public interest respondents point to the following factors to support their position the respondents and their affiliates have spotless regulatory records and the conduct at issue did not harm the clients of the funds the conduct was no more than inadvertent and mfs and mr bacarella complied with industry custom and laws on disclosure and the commission failed to provide regulatory guidance as to how advisers should allocate ipos and did not direct advisers to disclose their private advisory relationships with directors of mutual funds they advised mfs and bacarella br at  respondent henry believes that the sanctions sought by the division are unwarranted and not in the public interest mr henry contends that he did not act with intent to deceive or harm shareholders interests that the profits he received were at worst de minimus that he terminated his trading activity in ipos from the adviser shortly after discovering there was a potential for impropriety and that he is unlikely to engage in improper behavior in the future respondent henry maintains that suspension is not in the public interest because he did not act willfully and disgorgement is improper because his profits did not result from a purchase or sale of fund securities henry and valiant br at  respondent russo contends that the fiduciary duty theory of liability is not regulated by the federal securities laws that he did not wrongfully receive ipo allocations from mfs that the disclosures allegedly required were not material and that he did not act or fail to act with scienter and was not negligent russo br at   respondent russo argues that the penalty provisions of the section bc of the exchange act are inapplicable because he did not act deliberately or recklessly no one was harmed because there was no evidence of any monetary loss to any investor in the monetta trust he was not unjustly enriched he has no prior regulatory violations and there is no need for deterrence because he is no longer in a position to violate the law russo br at  finding the following considerations comprise the relevant norms for assessing the public interest determination the egregiousness of the defendants actions the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction the degree of scienter involved the sincerity of the defendants assurances against future violations the defendants recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct and the likelihood that the defendants occupation will present opportunities for future violations steadman v sec  fd   th cir  affd on other grounds  us   the severity of a

twelve ipos the violations by mr russo who as an attorney should have been aware of a fiduciarys responsibilities occurred from march until september  and involved eight ipos the violations by respondent henry occurred from april until june  and involved the purchase and sale of four ipos respondents surreptitious use of a position of trust for their personal benefit the conflicting or

commit future violations censure the divisions position is that mfs should be censured pursuant to section e of the advisers act and section b of the investment company act div br at  a censure is the mildest form of reprimand available to the commission finding in view of the legal conclusions in this decision a censure of mfs is in the public interest suspension the divisions position is that mr bacarella should be suspended from associating with any entity in the securities industry pursuant to sections b and h of the exchange act section f of the advisers act and section b of the investment

interest to suspend mr bacarella from association with any investment adviser and any investment company for ninety days and to suspend mr mr henry and mr russo from association with any investment company for thirty days the fact that this sanction is more limited than what the division recommended as to mr bacarella does not minimize the seriousness of mr bacarellas violations however those violations occurred solely in relation to his activities as the controlling person of an investment adviser and as a person associated with an investment company there has been no showing that mr bacarella represents a threat to the investing public in other facets of the securities industry the divisions recommendation goes beyond what is called for by the commissions case law see james
