corporate governance responsibility news regulatory filings information micro cap investor center leadership news regulatory filings by laws corporate governance ir contacts contact us about the micro cap industry humans have carried on mining operations since the beginning of time prehistoric people mined the “lion cave” in swaziland for a type of iron oxide as early as  bc which they used like glitter to decorate their bodies  today miners explore for oil gas rock salt stone gravel coal and minerals—both base and precious metals—from every column of the periodic chart   mining is divided into two segments surface and underground underground mining once much more common has been outpaced by surface mining in modern times surface mining delivers  percent of minerals and  percent of metallic ores quarrying open pit mining strip mining and mountaintop removal used primarily for coal mining are all forms of surface mining    similarly mining companies fall into either of two categories majors and juniors major mining companies are usually publiclyheld multinational firms with revenue of  million or more their role in the industry is that of producer they perform the ongoing mining operation required to extract target minerals from the earth then to handle mine closure and land reclamation once the site becomes unproductive   junior mining companies primarily take on the role of exploration their exploration activities provide the major companies with new sites to mine  while their revenue seldom exceeds  million it is the junior minors that drive industry growth   just as sales organizations often divide their sales team into “hunters” who find new business and “farmers” who cultivate each account to maximize revenue junior companies are the “hunters” of the mining industry they secure its future as such junior mining companies as “playing a senior role” in the industry  what juniors do because junior companies are staffed with highly trained engineers geophysicists geologists and scientists they have the expertise to identify sites that are most likely to produce target minerals in economic quantity over a significant period of time exploration includes studying properties that have previously been productive usually referred to as “brown fields” as well as socalled “green fields” that have not previously been mined    a range of technologies allow miners to evaluate a given plot geophysical surveys often done from an aircraft look for gravitational and magnetic signatures that indicate presence of a particular mineral electromagnetic studies determine the electrical conductivity of rock satellite imagery including satellitebased spectroscopy uses the visible spectrum and those beyond visible to identify desirable characteristics these and other techniques lead to a step known as resource evaluation a process that estimates the quality and expected yield from the site this step requires drilling and core

began in  since then the district has produced in excess of  million tons of ore from the balmat edwards hyatt and pierrepont mine complexes with average grades ranging from  zn to  zn the balmat mine operated continuously from  –  when production ceased due to depressed zinc metal prices production resumed in  to directly address a projected short term concentrate shortfall at the parent companys smelter the mine was closed and placed on care and maintenance in the fall of  after the projected smelter need was addressed in the face of a general economic turndown and resulting fall in zinc prices the balmat mine has produced a total of  million tons grading  zinc the mine is fully permitted and in compliance with all current federal and state mining regulations and is currently on care and maintenance status geology and mineralization the balmatedwards district zinc deposits occur in intensely folded distorted and deformed proterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the nw adirondack lowlands subjected to high temperature and high pressure metamorphism during the grenville orogeny approximately  billion years ago the zinc deposits are hosted in the upper marble formation a sequence of shallow water carbonate units characterized by siliceous dolomitic diopsiderich and evaporatebearing marbles zinc orebodies exhibit tabular or podlike geometries and occupy zones within the hinges and axial regions of folds and faults associated with the sylvia lake syncline a major regional scale structure recognized at balmat the balmat deposits are classified as sedextype commonly defined as deposits formed from precipitation of metals from brines generated by evaporation and movement of fluids through carbonate and evaporaterich rocks in marine sedimentary basins the fluidsbrines leach metals as they migrate through the sedimentary pile along regional and local structures and ultimately reach the sea floor where the metals precipitate as lenses and sheets in

mineralization is associated with the tertiary intrusive event and includes veinfissure type deposits chimneymanto replacements skarns and silicified breccia veins and pipes the chopar project area and the larger star mining district hold significant potential for economic concentrations of skarn and sedimenthosted auag mineralization the presence of skarn mineralization in outcrop in historic

operations of cs mining immediately adjacent to the project area are proof that small scale open pit mining operations may be successfully permitted and operated in beaver county   leadership joseph
