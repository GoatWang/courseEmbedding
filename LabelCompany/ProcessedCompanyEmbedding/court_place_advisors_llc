securities and exchange commission sec part  provides basic information about the firm’s organization and clients and is available at the securities and exchange commission website the part  brochure is most relevant to clients and includes information about our services fees and investment strategies download our part a the fiduciary difference  the fiduciary difference federal and state law requires that investment advisors are held to a fiduciary standard this law requires that an advisor act solely in the best interest of the client even if that interest is in conflict with the advisor’s financial interest investment advisors must disclose any conflict or potential conflict to the client prior to and throughout a business engagement investment advisors must adopt a code of ethics and fully disclose how they are compensated unfortunately only a small proportion of financial advisors are federally or stateregistered investment advisors most socalled financial advisors are considered brokerdealers by the united states securities and exchange commission sec they are held to a lower standard of diligence on behalf of their clients in fact they are required by federal law to act in the best interest of their employer not in the best interest of their clients because brokerdealers are not necessarily acting in your best interest the sec requires them to add the following disclosure to your client agreement read this disclosure and decide if this is the type of relationship you want to dictate your financial security   your account is a brokerage account and not an advisory account our interests may not always be the same as yours please ask us questions to make sure you understand your rights and our obligations to you including the extent of our obligations to disclose conflicts of interest and to act in your best interest we are paid both by you and sometimes by people who compensate us based on what you buy therefore our profits and our salespersons’ compensation may vary by product and over time   if this disclaimer appears in agreements you are signing you should ask questions of your advisor obtain complete disclosure about how he or she is compensated and where his or her loyalties lie then decide if the relationship is in your best interest advisors who are affiliated with a brokerdealer firm are most likely not fiduciaries if the client signs an nasd binding arbitration agreement which is required by almost every brokerdealer firm then the firm’s advisors would not be held to a fiduciary standard by the north american securities dealers cfp practitioners and financial planners will be held to a fiduciary standard if they are also registered investment advisors ria or associated with an ria how compensation is related to fiduciary conduct one of the best ways to judge if your financial advisor is held to a fiduciary standard is to find out how he or she is compensated feeonly compensation – this model minimizes conflicts of interest a feeonly financial advisor charges clients directly for his or her advice andor ongoing management no other financial reward is provided directly or indirectly by any other institution feeonly financial advisors are selling only one thing their knowledge by working with court place advisors llc a feeonly firm you can be assured that we are always working for you with no conflicts of interests all fees are properly disclosed to our clients prior to working together feebased compensation – this popular form of compensation is often confused with feeonly but it is very different feebased advisors earn some of their compensation from fees paid by their client but they may also receive compensation in the form of commissions or discounts from financial products they are licensed to sell furthermore they are not required to inform their clients in detail how their compensation is accrued the feebased model creates many potential conflicts of interest because the financial products that the client selects affect the advisor’s income commissions – an advisor who is compensated solely through commission’s faces immense conflicts of interest this type of advisor is not paid unless a client buys or sells a financial product a commissionbased advisor earns money on each transaction—and thus has a great incentive to encourage transactions that might
