craighallum capital group llc research division operator greetings and welcome to the vertex energy inc second quarter  financial results operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded it is now my pleasure to introduce your host ben cowart chairman and ceo thank you mr cowart you may begin benjamin p cowart thank you operator joining me today on the call is mr chris carlson our chief financial officer and michael porter our investor relations consultant at porter levay  rose before we begin the business portion of this call and on behalf of the company id like to inform you that this company expects to make forwardlooking statements during todays call statements including words such as believe anticipate expect and statements in the future tense are forwardlooking statements these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on managements current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance a number of factors could cause the companys actual future results to differ materially from its current expectations thank you everyone for joining us on our second quarter  earnings call for vertex energy this call coincides with yesterdays filings of our q for the quarter ending june   i want to start by giving you a few highlights from q then ill turn the call over to chris carlson our cfo so that he can walk you through our second quarter financial performance following chris presentation ill provide some thoughts on our plans for the remainder of the year and ill make some closing remarks we will then open the line for questions the second quarter of this year showed an improvement in revenue gross profit and net income relative to q  as some of the expected results from our recent acquisition have begun to take hold here are a few quick highlights that well touch on in more detail during this call our gross profit increased by approximately  relative to the same quarter last year the improvement is related to the fact that we are now able to source an increased amount of feedstock for tcep via our collection network rather than having to purchase the bulk of the raw material from third parties revenue increased by  relative to the same quarter of last year to  million overall volumes of products sold also an important matrix for our business as it illustrates our reach into the market increased by  for q  versus q  our overall per barrel margin increased by  relative to the same quarter a year ago this ties into our improved gross profit overall and illustrates our ability to drive down feedstock cost across our business before discussing our outlook for the remainder of  id first like to turn the call over to our cfo chris carlson for a more detailed review of our financial performance during q  chris christopher carlson thank you ben for more information please refer to our press release issued yesterday our latest form q for the fiscal quarter ending june   as well as our other filings made with the securities and exchange commission i also want to mention before we proceed that all financial numbers are prepared unless noted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles note that the acquisition ben referenced was completed in september and we have integrated these new operations into our business id like to now discuss our results for the quarter ended june   we reported consolidated revenue of  million compared to  million in q  this represents a  revenue increase the revenue increase was due primarily to increased sales volumes that were somewhat offset by decreased commodity prices you can find more detailed information on the various pricing benchmarks that are most applicable to our business in our q that was filed yesterday as discussed in previous calls we generate revenues from  existing operating divisions with the acquisition completed in september of  the company is now reporting tcep results within the black oil division the figures ill reference on this call take into account the change in reporting so that last years q figures represent an appropriate comparison to this years q figures black oil division revenue for q  was  million as compared to  million in the second quarter of last year this decrease in black oil revenue is attributable to a decrease in commodity prices which again was somewhat offset by an  volume increase on a yearoveryear basis tcep which again is a business unit within our black oil division generated  million in revenue for q  versus  million in q  this  yearoveryear decrease was driven by lower commodity prices and an  decline in volume the lower volume is attributable to downtime at the facility related to the implementation of tcep process modifications designed to optimize production and reduce future costs the refining  marketing division produced revenue of  million in the second quarter versus  million in q  this represents a  increase over the prior year period which is primarily attributable to a  increase in volume this is a normalization of the volumes yeartodate in addition it reflects the normalization of volumes that were missed in the first quarter due to the planned turnarounds that were scheduled for the refining  marketing business our gross profit increased in the second quarter to  million compared to  during the same period last year this  increase was driven primarily by our ability to source feedstock at a lower cost which ben mentioned earlier in the call looking at these results by division our gross profit for the black oil division was  million for the quarter a  increase over last years q gross profit of approximately  tcep had a gross profit of  in q  compared to a negative gross profit of approximately  a year ago the refining  marketing division generated gross profit of  million for the quarter a  increase compared to q s gross profit of  selling general and administrative expenses increased in q  relative to the second quarter last year due to the significant increase in our staff from  to  employees as a result of our acquisition our second quarter sga expense was  million versus  for q  on a go forward basis we anticipate sga being higher than in previous years because we are now a larger company we are actively working on reducing our sga expenses and it is our belief that improved gross margins associated with the benefit of collecting our own used oil for processing will more than offset the increased sga associated with these collection efforts as we move forward net income we had net income of roughly  million or  per fully diluted share in the second quarter of this year this was a significant increase compared to s q net loss of roughly  which represented a per fully diluted share figure of negative  i want to point out that our q  net income includes a noncash benefit to our bottom line it has been determined that the  earnings target associated with the performancebased portion of the acquisition completed in september will not be met therefore we have reduced the contingent consideration on our balance sheet by  million net income would have been  for q  without this adjustment i also want to point out that we do expect our performance to improve during the second half of the year we believe that revenue for  will be in the range of  million to  million and net income will be between  million and  million or  to  per fully diluted share id like to now turn the call back over to ben cowart our ceo benjamin p cowart thank you chris as we look ahead for the rest of this year i want to share some of our thoughts and what transpired in the second quarter and where we see the business heading for the remainder of  were now seeing the benefits of our acquisition materialized in our gross margins with increased  which has increased across the board for this quarter both in our black oil division and our refining  marketing division as well as our tcep business as we continue to grow our ability to collect our own used oil for processing we expect these margins to show improvements we are pleased with the  overall growth in our black oil division compared to last year were focused on growing our internal collections of used oil we collect ourself compared to last year as well were focused on growing these internal collections of used oil because we realized higher margins on our tcep finished product made from used oil that we collect relative to margins on used oil that we aggregate from other collectors although the overall generator volume across the country is shrinking we are very pleased with the fact that our companys collected volume continues to grow and weve experienced an  increase in our direct generator business compared to last year tcep did not perform to our expectations during the second quarter for  specific reasons one is prices for  oil this is the commodity that is most relevant to the pricing of our tcep end product it declined which negatively impacted our price per barrel of finished product by  relative to the same quarter a year ago we had  number two we had a greaterthanexpected downtime associated with the implementation of our process improvements at our tcep facility in baytown texas this facility was designed to increase production and reduce operating costs as a result of this downtime we processed less volume this quarter than anticipated it is our belief that we will begin to see both improved throughput and decreased per barrel operating cost at tcep in the fourth quarter of this year on the positive side as we had expected given the lower volumes and margins in the first quarter we saw a tremendous improvement in our refining  marketing division on both a yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter basis we believe that this business unit provides us with diversification within our space as the feedstock and end product prices are not highly correlated with the commodity products driving the other units of our business we see  key areas for longterm growth as the company continues to evolve number one we want to leverage our platform to grow our feedstock supply base our diverse network of generator customers currently cover a large portion of the state of texas and provides an annualized volume of nearly  million gallons of used oil our goal is to double that volume in the future to achieve this goal we are pursuing organic growth opportunities while we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that will enable us to secure our supply this will allow us to produce tcep finished products at better margins on average we currently realized an increased  in gross margin on tcep barrels produced from oil vertex collects versus oil purchased from third parties number two we want to expand the scope of tcep from both a geographic and product perspective were continuing to evaluate other potential locations to build new tcep facilities at a lower cost than competing used oil processing technologies were also working on expanding the application of tcep to processing other hydrocarbon materials besides used oil which would allow us to source other types of feedstock and produce a greater variety of end products number three we want to capitalize on our vertical integration potential vertex now handles collects aggregation and processing and sale of various end products we intend to leverage our capabilities to capitalize on additional opportunities such as the recycling of used oil filters processing of antifreeze  or used antifreeze and the pursuit of other distressed hydrocarbon streams for processing through tcep the vertical integration strategy will allow us to pursue synergistic acquisitions that will further expand our addressable markets before we move on to the questionandanswer portion of this call i want to let the listeners know that if you have any followup questions or comments please feel free to contact our porter levay  rose investor relations representative mr marlon nurse at area code   also i want to mention that a digital replay will be available via telephone approximately  hours after the calls completion for the next  weeks details on how to access the replay can be found in our recent press release operator were now ready to take a limited number of questions pertaining to the matters discussed on this call and our q remember were unable to discuss any information or business plans which are not publicly available questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from michael hoffman with wunderlich michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division just a little housekeeping so i got all the right numbers the  to  does that include the  million noncash adjustment christopher carlson yes michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division okay and that  would that  if i get the calculation right thats about  in the second quarter christopher carlson yes thats correct michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division okay and then with regards to the business outlook so the  you mentioned several things in your presentation youve been enjoying better cost of goods sold because youre acquiring feedstock at a lower price where does that trend at this point has it  its come down and stabilized or is it continuing to come down benjamin p cowart no i would say that yearoveryear and chris you have the details but our costs for feedstock across the board is much lower than it was last year now the negative balance to that is that our sale prices come down as well the index that we sell our finished products into is down about  yearoveryear michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division and on a relative basis today as you look into the second half are we  its down and stable or down and continuing to fall both of them both of the cost of goods sold and the sale price benjamin p cowart yes i think were seeing a slight continued fall in our feedstock costs and were starting to see a lift in our sale price of finished products being sold so were getting a slight continued improvement on the raw material while were getting lift both from oil prices and actual margins on our sale price so that is improving second quarter was a little bit challenging on the sell side and were seeing that make a turn michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division okay and then would you describe any particular seasonality between the  quarters in the second half benjamin p cowart yes there is some seasonality the way weve sold our finished product in the past our buyers have typically smoothed out those market conditions to where we really didnt see that take place and today were really looking to make sure were capturing all the margin on the sell side for the company and so were more in the market selling to multiple buyers and so we will have a little bit more feel of the season under that sales model compared to just selling all to one customer so we  second quarter is typically a soft quarter for the sales of tcep products and then it starts to firm up in the fourth and first quarter third quarter is kind of a not bad not great but as it gets cold theres more residual fuel being blended for heat and theres more demand for our product obviously as diesel replacement cutter stock in those residual fuel blends michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division okay thats very helpful and then last question for me the nickel difference  to  what has to happen to get that nickel is it just cost or is it both cost and revenue christopher carlson its a combination of both cost and revenue which again were looking at volume as well were expecting continued volume improvement operator our next question comes from jan bennett sic chad bennett with craig hallum chad m bennett  craighallum capital group llc research division so maybe this is a couple of questions kind of off the first questioners call  or questions but  so where are we today in terms of  oil pricing and your relative premium to that and discount on the feedstock side i think you directionally talked about it but can you give us a sense where we are today benjamin p cowart yes let me just start with the second quarter relative discounts to that index compared to first quarter and back to fourth quarter second quarter we were down probably  a barrel maybe chris yes roughly  a barrel for the second quarter and were currently probably recovered  maybe  of that in the third quarter and we believe thats going to continue to improve as we finish out the third quarter so we see things firming back up second quarter obviously had its seasonal toll on demand and the price for the products but it is firming back up and were seeing improvements chad m bennett  craighallum capital group llc research division so theres a new plant new rerefinery for base oil in georgia and i believe one in florida how is that impacting your ability to grow collection volumes is it at all and pricing thereof benjamin p cowart yes i think every time you add a rerefinery for used oil theres more demand and theres pressure on the street as far as generator business and weve sensed some of that but as i said before in the last question our cost continues to come down and so we dont feel that it is impacting us too bad compared to what we see other companies in other  in some of those regions theyre really dealing with a lot of pressure on the streets so we  our volumes are up acrosstheboard  and in our black oil division acrosstheboard  and i dont have our yearoveryear numbers but i believe were trending as a company right at  over the  for the last  years so we continue to grow so im thankful for that i believe our folks are seeing opportunities in the market to capture more volume and place it both in the new capacity for tcep that were bringing in as well as into the export market so i would say that were  even within the new refining capacity that is coming in were getting our share of the market and doing well there chad m bennett  craighallum capital group llc research division okay and then is it still the case in your baytown tcep plant that on the finished goods side or the finished products side that  especially with your increase in capacity there that theres still more than enough demand there to fully utilize your increased capacity at that plant and if thats the case should we  i know you cant control  oil but your premium relative to that  oil benchmark if demand is kind of unlimited that should still hold you believe at least as far as you can see benjamin p cowart yes as far as i see the new output theres a strong market for the product it does soften and firm up based on different times of the year but weve never had a problem selling the production weve made in the past and we dont anticipate having any issue selling the production going forward and i believe that our relative discount to that market should stay consistent with market conditions so i believe were fine there chad m bennett  craighallum capital group llc research division okay and then last one for me chris can you give us an update on kind of where the cash and the balance sheet stands today versus the end of the quarter has anything changed christopher carlson no nothing has changed since the end of the quarter obviously as you look at the numbers you look at the cash flow statement balance sheet it was negative for the second quarter by about  were still about in that  right in that range i do see improvement over the next  to  weeks though chad m bennett  craighallum capital group llc research division okay so you expect cash to just kind of pop back up because inventories were a little bit high right christopher carlson thats exactly right inventories were high theyre still relatively high but the next  to  weeks weve got a lot of sales booked benjamin p cowart yes i think that was going to be my comment there when we make the turnarounds and the modifications to the plant our sales were off for the second quarter because the plant was down but it didnt stop the volume and the growth on that volume to continue to build so we finished the quarter with a lot of raw material which weve been plowing through very well so i believe well see some nice improvements around the inventory coming down and turning that into margin and into sales operator our next question comes from of greg gartner ph with gartner fund ph unknown analyst its actually the argyle fund just as a followup from that last item with the inventory high and the production increasing is there  is the tcep facility running at full production or with increased collections could it even go higher because im sort of driving towards the timeframe when a new plant might need to come in i just want to understand that within the growth objective benjamin p cowart yes so we are ramping up from the expansion were ramping up as we speak in this month we believe september the plant will be running at full production we believe in the fourth quarter the plant will be running at full efficiency so we wanted to get production lined out and get that stabilized as we bring efficiencies in going into the fourth quarter so i think the answer to your question is yes were running as far as timing on the second plant i think thats going to really depend on both available supply in certain regions and were looking at multiple parts of the us that we still believe are unaddressed with technology that have the feedstock but then weve got to match finished product sales into those markets or look at the logistic costs to move the product into key markets we have a little bit of a unique market for our product so we strictly sell our products offshore or by marine modes of transportation so it limits the locations of where we would build our plants based on those factors unknown analyst and at this point i mean is a new tcep facility is that a couple of years away or is that something that you actually would potentially start next year benjamin p cowart to be completely operational i would say within the next couple of years would be more realistic would we break ground and be moving on a new facility the answer would be probably sooner than that and depending on the market opportunities weve got  we have  technologies within our company that we can pick from so were looking at some interesting opportunities both with our tcep and in combination with some other technology that could position us so theres just a lot of work we finished the redesign of our tcep technology so weve got that engineering done so were moving down that path and weve made a lot of headway were well prepared today to move on the next opportunity unknown analyst and with the goal of doubling the feedstock and covering texas is the current baytown facility going to be able to handle that benjamin p cowart yes i think thats a very important priority for us because theres a lot more margin on the collected volume versus the oil we buy from third party so think about the plant running about  million gallons a year at baytown were collecting  million so we have  opportunities as we bring another  million gallons into the plant from our own collections we can either expand our capacity assuming everything balances out or we can back out some of the thirdparty oil that were buying at the facility and that could be through acquisition of some of the suppliers that were currently buying from today so theres multiple variables that would get us there but the answer is yes the capacity is there to accommodate our direct collection growth unknown analyst okay and when you say full production in september youre talking about the  million gallons per year run rate benjamin p cowart thats correct last year were about  million i guess and thats finished product output thats what our  thats goal coming out of this improvement that we just made unknown analyst okay so i assume the feedstock is actually a little higher volume when we talked about the  million benjamin p cowart yes yes thats correct unknown analyst okay and just one last item on the vertical integration third key to growth what kind of margins are associated with that with collecting additional product benjamin p cowart yes we really like the ancillary streams of material like the oil filters weve got a technology at our corpus christi facility to process oil filters and were looking at some addon technology that will really take our margins on that business   is that right chris so were looking at that that really allows us to fully monetize that that waste stream and then also on the antifreeze we have a plant here in houston at our hh location and it processes the waste antifreeze and weve produced finished glycols that are then reblended compounded and repackaged in the finished product and we take that finished coolant back to our customer base and it has a significant margin so were at capacity now in that unit were looking at expanding that business as we go forward so we really want to be a fully integrated company very deep and dense in our footprint that were collecting the oil the filters and the waste antifreeze and capture the full margin using the right technologies to do that so were  weve got a lot of effort making sure that our model gets fully developed as we expand our collection business unknown analyst but is it safe to assume if you execute on the vertical integration that certainly it would be additional revenues but it might occur at lower margins in the tcep benjamin p cowart i dont know that i would say that i think as we  the vertical integration really adds margin to the business revenues will increase somewhat but its really fully monetizing and catching the value of the residual streams that we are managing today so thats how were looking at it operator operator instructions our next question comes from michael hoffman with wunderlich michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division yes ben just a couple of followups am i correct i thought we heard that the tampa plant that was coming on hasnt even started pouring its foundation and theyve actually slowed down hiring and at this time it looks like that plant is not probably going forward the guys at newalta pulled their capacity out safetykleen has said theyre not adding new capacity so it looks like some of that new rerefinering capacity is actually coming off the market benjamin p cowart no i agree overall michael that the industry is back way up from building additional plants the only difference is the plant in tampa in my personal opinion is going to be built i believe its under construction and from our conversations with the company theyre saying somewhere around february to april on a startup for that plant in tampa michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division okay ill follow up with you then because i was in a meeting yesterday and they havent even started pouring foundation benjamin p cowart well ive seen some aerial pictures and some information that shows the construction underway so well compare our notes and make sure were michael e hoffman  wunderlich securities inc research division okay and then on the refining  marketing side there was a little softness in some of the marine market where is that now benjamin p cowart on the refining  marketing its a different market that were selling into so i want to make sure were not talking about the marine market that buys the tcep finished products because what we produce in port arthur at the refining  marketing business is more chemicalbased and gasolinebased finished products so those markets were very strong in the second quarter and still strong so we really  we had a turnaround with several of our suppliers and so we had a turnaround in port arthur as well in the first quarter so our numbers in volume was down our inventory backed up but in the second quarter we pushed everything through and we had a complete recovery of first quarter and hit all our targets for second quarter and third quarter look solid as we go forward operator there are no further questions in queue at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to mr cowart for closing comments benjamin p cowart okay thank you very much and i appreciate everyone being on the call today if you have any more questions feel free
