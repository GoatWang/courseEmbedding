empowered cytokines™ ilecs that specifically target the interleukin receptor ilr unlike normal cells the ilr is overexpressed in  different cancers corresponding to an annual incidence of over  million ilr positive cancers read more our mission our mission is to be the leader in the development and commercialization of targeted empowered cytokines™ and superkines™ for the treatment of cancer we aim to achieve our goals by drawing on our expertise with that of worldclass collaborators to develop a unique set of superkines™ that can be fused with proapoptotic proteins in order to precisely deliver potent cellkilling agents to cancer cells the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and cancer stem cells without harming healthy cells our name the name medicenna is derived by fusing the word “medicine” with the name avicenna who has for a thousand years retained his original renown as one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history he is regarded as the father of

cancer cells and nonmalignant cells of the tme analysis of over  cancer biopsies shows that the ilr is overexpressed in  different types solid and hematological cancers corresponding to an annual incidence rate of over a million ilr positive cancers the ililr axis plays a prominent role in supporting the establishment and maintenance of a robust tme thereby protecting the cancer from the

therapeutics corp  our science  the challenge skip to main content home»our science»the challenge the challenge cancer continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide according to the world health organization there were m new cases of cancer worldwide in  in  there will be nearly m although advanced targeted therapies have improved survival outcomes for some cancers the cure rates for the majority of cancers still remain low there are many reasons for the challenges that lie ahead for instance in a wide range of tumor types there exists a typically small subpopulation of cells within the cancer that have been termed tumorinitiating cells or cancer stem cells cscs cscs have been shown to be more chemotherapy and radiation resistant than noncscs furthermore although cancer cells and cscs are the driving force of tumor development and progression these transformed cells cannot do it alone it is the complex interaction between the cancer and surrounding nonmalignant cells of the tumor microenvironment tme that helps drive the process of cancer progression so progression from normal to benign benign to malignant malignant to metastatic is driven not just by whats happening inside the cancer cell itself but also by whats happening around it the big advantage cancer cells have is their ability to mutate and develop resistance following conventional therapies fortunately nonmalignant host cells of the tme do not mutate or develop resistance therefore within the context of ecology and darwinian evolution the most efficient way to kill a species cancer cells and cscs is to alter its ecosystem tme email alerts email address  mailing lists  press releases events  presentations   enter the code shown above  investor contact for more investor information

our science  our approach skip to main content home»our science»our approach our approach at medicenna our approach is to develop and commercialize a novel class of multitargeted fusion proteins we call interleukin empowered cytokines ilecs these proprietary firstinclass targeted molecular trojan horses are designed to harness the exceptional specificity and affinity of superkines™ engineered cytokines to selectively and simultaneously deliver cell killing payloads to the bulk tumor tumor microenvironment tme and cancer stem cells csc the interleukin receptor ilr is an attractive target for the development of cancer therapeutics because it is frequently and intensely expressed on a wide variety of human carcinomas the recent determination of a pivotal role for ilr in the emergence and advancement of the malignant phenotype overexpression on cancer stem cells cscs and its dominant role in the tumor microenvironment tme validates our approach of pursuing with the ilr as an important cancer target components of the tme such as tumor associated macrophages tams myeloid derived suppressor cells mdscs and a thth profile are each attributed to a robust ililr bias and generally associated with highly aggressive forms of cancer and poor survival outcomes we believe that major improvement in cancer outcomes can be achieved if a multipronged approach was deployed medicenna’s ilecs are capable of ablating the bulk tumor depleting cancer stem cells cscs weakening the angiogenic protumoral microenvironment tams and stripping the immunosuppressive cloak protecting the tumor mdscs by doing so ilecs have the potential to radically improve patient outcomes our target centric approach is complemented by our patient centric approach in that by selecting patient populations that have a biased ililr profile we believe that our ilecs will have a higher probability of clinical regulatory and reimbursement success email alerts email address  mailing lists  press

medicenna therapeutics corp announces phase b clinical trial of mdna jun   brainlab and medicenna therapeutics corp jointly announced that recurrent glioblastoma rgb patients in a phase b clinical trial of mdna a targeted immunotherapy agent have been treated at three clinical centers in the united states using innovative drug delivery technology from brainlab the investigators used convection enhanced delivery ced to inject mdna together with an imaging agent directly into the tumor when combined with realtime image guided mri ced allows delivery of mdna at high concentrations into the tumor tissue while avoiding exposure to the rest of the body the current phase b clinical trial plans to enroll  adult patients with rgb at leading brain cancer centers in the united states precise targeting is an integral part in the treatment of brain tumors to achieve significant coverage iplan flow planning software from brainlab helps determine trajectories for drug infusions while varioguide a universal instrument holder is then used to guide the drug delivery device into place for treatment designed specifically for planning drug delivery procedures iplan flow software determines trajectories and infusion parameters based on patientspecific image data the combination of this technology with clinical trial support services allows brainlab to offer a comprehensive
