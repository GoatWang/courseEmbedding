customers of chobani brand greek yogurt complained of gastrointestinal problems after consuming products manufactured in the companys idaho plant the company issued a recall and claimed that the fungal contaminant murcor circinelloides was only a potential danger to immunocompromised individuals yet complaints of severe gi discomfort continued from otherwise healthy customers and researchers began to question the fungus and its ability to cause harm in healthy humans  resulting research has found that this fungus is not harmless after all but a strain with the ability to cause disease  in the study the researchers isolated a strain of the fungus from a yogurt container that was subject to recall using a technique known as multilocus sequence typing mlst they identified the strain as mucor circinelloides f circinelloides mcc unlike other strains of the fungus that particular subspecies is commonly associated with human infections mucho is sexually compatible with an m circinelloides f circinelloides isolate zygospore formation between mucho and − nrrl was observed whereas mucho did not mate with  nrrl data not shown the results indicate that mucho is the  mating type its mating ability with the other m circinelloides f circinelloides isolate also supports that mucho is m circinelloides f circinelloides scale is  µm credit  doimbio wholegenome sequence analysis of the yogurt isolate confirmed it as being closely related to mcc and also revealed the possibility that this fungus could produce harmful metabolites that were previously unknown in this species the researchers then tested the strain on mice where the fungus showed an ability to cause lethal infections when the fungal spores were injected into the bloodstream as well as to survive passage through the gi tract when the spores were ingested orally  maybe accept science more and you will put people at risk less image link dr piper klemm when people think about foodborne pathogens

said dr alejandro mazzotta chobani vice president of global quality food safety and regulatory affairs dr mazzotta continued “in regards to this specific study we were just made aware of it and want to take more time to review its methodology and assertions to our knowledge there is no evidence including the assertions presented in this publication that the strain in the recalled products causes illness in consumers when ingested food quality and safety has always been and always will be paramount to chobani through our partnership with cornell university and other leading institutions we constantly look for ways to further promote quality and safety in the dairy industry” to further ensure the continued safety and quality of its products since its voluntary recall in september  chobani has implemented additional state of the art equipment for microbiological testing and the company routinely conducts more than  microbiological tests daily from crafting and finished product samples in excess of the regulatory requirements  additionally chobani has significantly invested in experienced and accomplished people in october of last year it named dr alejandro mazzotta one of

single day the ultimate arms race viruses have continually infected humans just as they do today some early viruses even became integrated into our genome and are now known as human endogenous retroviruses hervs over millions of years they became inert due to mutations or major deletions in their genetic code today one of the most studied herv families is the hervk family which has been active since the evolutionary split of humans and chimpanzees with some members perhaps actively infecting humans within the past couple hundred thousand years zika linked to miscarriages thin brain tissue in babies feb     comments zika virus can cross the placenta intended to protect the developing fetus and appears to lead to a high percentage of miscarriages and to babies born with thin brain tissue and inflammation in brain cells at least in micemice are not little people of course or every disease would have been cured by now and every chemical would be toxic but its a starting point for understanding the role of zika in birth defects beyond vague epidemiology the machiavellian side of cholera feb     comments recently two armies were pitted against each other with harpoonlike appendages covered in poison they went two war stabbing each other and rupturing victims like water balloons it was all mathematically predictable at least over time in a oneoff scenario tom brady and the new england patriots won the super bowl though in over  other instances where a team in the playoffs was down by  after three quarters they lost knowing the math could lead to new targeted therapies to fight infectionsbut dueling bacteria would not be the infectors in that scenario theyd be the remedy broccoli science natural fatty acids follow the golden ratio jan     comments the number of theoretically possible fatty acids with the same chain length but different structures can be determined with the aid of the famous fibonacci sequencethe ability to calculate the number of possible fatty acids is of great importance for their chemical analysis ‘lipidomics’ and a new paper states the number of possible fatty acids with increasing chain length rises at each step by a factor that agrees with what is called the ‘golden ratio’ the golden ratio is essentially a ratio that is the midpoint between asymmetry and symmetry when the whole is to the larger as the larger is to the smaller in numerical terms it is  how viruses leave messages for descendants on how to infect jan     comments many viruses face a choice after they have infected their hosts to replicate quickly killing the cell in the process or to become dormant and lie in wait hiv herpes and a number of other human viruses behave this way and in fact even the viruses that attack bacteria – phages – face similar decisions when invading a cell what causes a virus to choose dormancy over immediate gratification prof rotem sorek and his group in the weizmann institute’s department of molecular genetics have now discovered that during infection viruses secrete small molecules into their environment that other viruses can pick up and “read” in this way they can actually coordinate their attack turning simple messages into a fairly sophisticated strategy cheap way to kill off gonorrhea  mouthwash dec     comments a paper in sexually transmitted infections details a cheap way to kill off gonorrhea in the mouth  alcoholcontaining mouthwash gonorrhea is caused by bacteria and  curb the growth of the bacteria responsible  gonorrhea of the mouth has become more common among primarily gay men as fear of aids has declined that disease is quite treatable today and so fear of it has declined meaning a decline in condom use gonorrhea is also treatable with antibiotics but those heighten the risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of neisseria gonnorheae the bacteria responsible for the infection so concern is high if gay men wont use condoms maybe theyll use mouthwash paper hopes to link diet gut microbiome and colorectal cancer dec     comments a new paper links specific types of intestinal bacteria in the development of colorectal cancer  in animal models at least finding it in humans is another matterbut if such a link is ever found and currently these findings are only exploited by people selling something it could lead to dietarybased therapeutic interventions which may be able to modify the composition of the gut microbiome and reduce colorectal cancer risk avocado extract can prevent listeria in food nov     comments thanks to savvy marketing by food corporations who are looking for health halos to put over their food consumer demand for food products formulated without synthetic additives has increased there is a big drawback demonstrated by chipotle and others who are hoping to make themselves look healthier when selling junk food  it still has to be safe to eat additives synthetic or not are needed for food safety reasons so food product developers are faced with the challenge of developing more natural additives that can produce comparable in safety results with synthetic versions  over  million bacterial genes in the pig gut nov     comments pigs are a main livestock species for food production worldwide and is also widely used as an animal model in biomedical research today we know that the many types of bacteria that inhabit the gut are important for health and disease knowledge of the genes of these bacteria and their function therefore constitutes the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of how bacteria in the gut affect health and disease an international consortium of researchers from inra france university of copenhagen and seges denmark bgishenzhen china and nifes norway has now established the first catalog of bacterial genes in the gut of pigs this achievement is published in the latest issue of nature microbiology nitratereducing microbes
