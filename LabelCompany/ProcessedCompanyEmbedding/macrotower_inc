should make with record types richard actonmaher april   as we covered previously salesforce record types arent always the right solution whats important is knowing what type of type youre trying to capture in salesforce all cautions aside we left one thing out so what type of types are salesforce record types and when should you use them  read more how to clean up lead source one bite at a time kyle paice april   lead source is the single most important piece of information a marketing team tracks in their crm if its inaccurate or incomplete theyll be flying blind when its time to decide where to spend their budget youll lose leads opportunities and customers as a resultmost companies dont have clean attribution data and yet totally understand why its so important then why do they wait so long because cleaning attribution data can be a big undertaking so they put it off until they have the time to tackle it whenever i hear this rationale i think of the same sayinghow do you eat an elephant one bite at a timedont focus on the massive undertaking overall just focus on the next action you need to take to move things forward here are the bites you should take in order to clean up your lead source and attribution data once and for all read more counting down the top  sales ops mistakes richard actonmaher april   sales ops or any function that supports revenuegenerating teams is becoming increasingly more difficult and complex the good news is those teams are spending far less time typing tracking reporting and transcribing and far more doing exactly what they were hired to do generate more revenue but with every new tool or feature the underlying systems they use become exponentially more complex which means when things go wrong its harder to figure out why with that in mind weve compiled the top  mistakes sales ops professionals should avoid to keep these systems and their users running smoothly    dont wait too long to stop the bleeding if you just started using crm andor marketing automation software congrats youre on the right track unfortunately i suspect many people reading this already have a jungle of systems thats become overgrown and increasingly harder to keep track of due to months or years of neglect bad historical data broken api integrations old forms that dont use the right fields inexplicabe errors theyre usually all par for the course read more topics salesforce sales ops crm the revenue ops hierarchy of needs kyle paice april   im not a fan of sales ops as a term today every department has the sales reps equivalent of salesforce  a system that they live in for the majority of their day eg csms have gainsight marketers have hubspot etc since all of these systems are interconnected and rely on each other for key pieces of information revenue ops is probably a more accurate term for the person on your team thats responsible for making them all play nice the hardest part of onboarding a revenue ops manager so many projects so little time everyone on your exec team probably has a pet rock or two that they cant wait to get done since all of these projects have executive sponsors and seem super valuable the natural reaction is to dive in and just start fixing stuff believe it or not this can lead to disaster the good news theres a smart way to prioritize your revenue ops backlog based on maslows hierarchy of needs i present to you the macrotower hierarchy of revenue ops the idea is that you begin with a solid foundation and then build your way upward if there is some incredibly pressing business issue you can work on two adjacent levels in concert but i dont recommend skipping a level in my experience its a recipe for disaster level one optimal productivity read more why google analytics isnt great for saas kyle paice april   on the surface google analytics is a great product its free powerful and scales really well you can get its reports to tell you almost anything about which pages people view and how theyre interacting with them what google analytics cant do however is track who these people are and how they progress through the funnel over the course of a full sales cycleif youre a saas company and your sales model isnt selfserve youre gonna have a bad time running meaningful reports with google analytics read more dont play hideandseek with your costs richard actonmaher april   as weve discussed before cac is an incredibly important and powerful metric there is arguably no better way to reach profitable growth than by tracking cac closely and putting your money where it will have the highest roi but too often it seems like tracking it is a momumental feat somehow in all the hustle exactly how much was spent on what and what spending pertained to what campaign and what this random check was for from three months ago gets lost read more topics cac accounting finance without this data your cac stats are useless kyle paice april   unless youre tracking cac at the campaign level itll be tough to make the right decisions around where youll spend your marketing dollars as we discussed yesterday the math behind cac at the campaign level is simplein theory for campaign a caca  total spenda  customers acquireda but theres a danger in this simplicity the above formula can lead you to believe that only expenses that are exclusive to campaign a should be included in the equation you might think that caca doesnt have to take salaries and other highlevel marketing expenses into account that isnt true read more tracking cac by campaign is a really big deal kyle paice april   yesterday we had a brief explain like i’m five on customer acquisition cost today well run through why cac is so important and why you need to track it separately for all your different campaignsin case you missed it cac stands for customer acquisition cost it measures how much money a company has to spend in order to convince a customer to buy their productif a company is able to figure out which channels allow them to acquire customers cheapest then they can grow their business a lot faster why because they avoid wasting time and money on inefficient channels plus lowering cac means a company has the option to either pocket the increase in profit on each unit they sell or to charge less for their product without sacrificing existing profitthe easiest way to think about why lower cac is awesome youre spending less money to make money pretty great right read more abe always be experimenting kyle paice april   when the funnel is humming and you’re on pace to hit your goals for the quarter it’s a common reaction to focus  of your time money and attention on the campaigns that are already workingthis is a mistake read more eli customer acquisition cost cac kyle paice april   note cac is sometimes known as coca cost of customer acquisitioncustomer acquisition cost measures how much money on average you have to spend in order to close a new customerimagine you’re standing in front of three vending machines a b and c all three of them serve coke but there’s no prices on any of them just a place to feed your dollar and a red button to push you’re a little unsure for a moment and there are three people behind you in line so you decide to see what they do read more all posts next copyright   macrotower inc all rights
