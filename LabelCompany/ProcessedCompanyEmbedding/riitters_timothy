call joining me today are ceo scott dietzen and cfo tim riitters before we begin id like to remind you that during this call management will make forwardlooking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties these include statements regarding competitive industry and technology trends our strategy positioning and opportunity and our products business and operations including our revenue and margin guidance operating model and growth prospects our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance a discussion of risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the sec and we refer you to these public filings also during this call we will discuss nongaap measures in talking about the companys performance reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are provided in our earnings release this call is being broadcast on the web and is being recorded for playback purposes an archive of the webcast will be made available on pure storages investor relations website for approximately  days and is the property of pure storage with that ill turn the call over to our ceo scott dietzen scott dietzen thanks liz good afternoon and thanks for joining the pure storage third quarter earnings call we have a special guest today our vp of products matt kixmoeller who will add color in our qa and as usual there are new blog posts on our website with more detail that we encourage interested investors to read pure is winning in the marketplace because our storage platform is enabling customers to derive unique value from their data modern analytics including machine learning fundamentally depend on faster access to larger and evolving datasets only pure combines this scale density performance and low cost of ownership necessary to develop next generation data intensive applications as well as the bandwidth to connect that data to all applications legacy and commodity storage alternatives are too slow too siloed and too expensive to meet the demand of the data driven cloud or enterprise pure has the right platform for our customers’ more strategic data at the right time our financial performance confirms our unique value proposition q revenues grew  yearoveryear to  million  above the midpoint of our guidance we also saw improved leverage nongaap operating margin was  points better yearoveryear and five points ahead of the midpoint of guide in the quarter pure added more than  new customers increasing our customer count to more than  cloud deployments continue to account for more than a quarter of our sales driven our service over  softwareasaservice infrastructureasaservice and consumer cloud customers meanwhile pures international business remains robust growing  in the latest quarter repeat purchase rates also remain strong with our top  cohorts spending  more over the next  months for each dollar they spend initially we added many noteworthy new customers in q ill touch on just a few hyatt hotels is relying on pure to change it processes around app development deployment and management we also added the commercial real estate firm cushman  wakefield wireless service provider telecom italia calliduscloud a provider of saas sales and marketing software billcom a saas business payments company and laika an academy awardwinning animation studio competition in the enterprise remains fierce as our legacy competitors fight to protect their installed bases nevertheless our win rate has held strong and are on par with where they were a year ago as a result we now count more than  of the fortune  as customers up roughly  from last quarter we win for multiple reasons we have the most innovative products gartner placed us in the leaders magic guadrant we have the happiest customers that metrics calculates our net promoter score at  among the top  of all businesstobusiness companies and we have the most reliable platform flasharraym delivered six nines of uptime in its first year thats less than  seconds of downtime per year and we did so uniquely without maintenance windows pure was a pioneer in all flasharrays and we are ahead of the competition again with nvme nvme offers the potential for a fold increase in performance to processing many requests simultaneously rather than one at a time by extending nvme across the network petabytes of data in iraq can be accessed as if they were a local resource enabling shared storage to offer better performance and better economics than the server local storage or daz model popular in many clouds we believe all nvme is going to prove as bigger disruptor as all flash of the mainstream storage solutions only pure has been shipping nvme technology since  and only pure is ensuring customers current investments are protected en route to that all nvme future our competitors face extensive rewrites of their software while their customers face having to buy all new storage and migrate their data at the same time we are ramping for the full launch of flashblade our new product line for unstructured and big data customer feedback reaffirms that flashblade will revolutionize capacity indiscernible storage the same way flasharray rewrote the rules for performance storage while revenue from flashblade wont be material this year ga remains ontrack and customer enthusiasm is skyhigh some recent examples include cuprodigy a provider of private cloud solutions for credit unions it was using flashblade to elastically scale operations transparently to their applications and paylocity it was employing flashblade to support its saas payroll and human capital management software pures growth has been supported by strong channel partners in the latest quarter  of our net new logos came through the channel that expanding partner leverage which now includes key global systems integrators is essential to extending our reach we are also seeing strong traction for our flashstack partnership with cisco delivering converged infrastructure that combines best of reach servers and networking from cisco with pures bestinclass storage flashstack is growing triple digits yearoveryear today to sum up we are very well satisfied with our q and even more excited about the road ahead we are tracking toward our longterm goal of building a profitable multibillion dollar revenue company that will lead the global storage industry we are winning in cloud we are winning in the enterprise demand for flasharray remains strong with nvme set to tip the scales further in our favor and flashblade is ramping in a growth market that moves in our direction as flash costs drop we are providing the data platform that uniquely empowers our customers to maximize the value of their data and with that ill turn the call over to our cfo tim to provide further detail on q as well as our guidance for q tim timothy riitters thanks scott q was indeed an excellent quarter and im very pleased with strong execution around our operating model which calls for consistent topline growth balanced with meaningful yearoveryear improvements in operating leverage we are making great progress towards becoming a profitable multibillion dollar revenue company as scott mentioned before i dive into q specifics please note that the gross margin operating margin opex eps and free cash flow numbers i will use are nongaap unless otherwise noted a reconciliation of these nongaap metrics to the gaap comparables is available in our press release and in our earnings slide deck which are available on our website at investorpurestoragecom as scott said q total revenue grew  yearonyear and  quarteronquarter to a record  million which is  above the midpoint of our guidance product revenue in q grew  yearonyear and  quarteronquarter to  million driven in part by over  new customer additions and excellent demand from our existing customer base some of you have asked for more insight into our repeat business so beyond the top  that we have reported in the past im happy to say that across our entire customer base our repeat business is thriving for every  that our customers spend initially they spend an average of more than  additionally within the next  months we continue to ramp our flashblade business which had solid quarteronquarter revenue growth we are excited about the longterm opportunity it represents though as expected the revenue contribution was immaterial to our q results support revenue in q grew  yearonyear and  quarteronquarter to  million driven by revenue recognition of ongoing support contracts we continue to drive loyalty among our customers demonstrated by a strong customer retention rate in mid and our industryleading nps score of  looking at q from the geographic perspective  of our revenue came from the us and  from international compared to an  split in the prior fiscal year we are seeing notable success in regions across the board q total gross margins of  improved  percentage points yearonyear total gross margin declined  percentage points quarteronquarter we continue to be in the range of our target longterm model of between  and  for total gross margin product gross margin of  improved  percentage points yearonyear and declined  percentage points sequentially the yearonyear improvement reflects the shift to the higher capacity higher gross margin flasharray mseries products consistent with our q guidance the qonq decline was driven primarily by lower margin flashblade shipments as we continue the manufacturing ramp of this new product support gross margins of  improved  percentage points yearonyear and  percentage points sequentially this is driven by our expanding customer base and the deferred support revenue associated with increasing product revenue we continue to drive operational efficiencies within our support organization as we scale moving on to expenses as scott mentioned we continue to drive significant operating leverage yearonyear and sequentially while making strategic investments in the business in q rd expense was  million or  of revenue versus  million or  of revenue in the yearago quarter rd expense in absolute dollars increased  yearonyear driven primarily by continued investments relating to our next generations of flasharray and flashblade hardware and software sales and marketing expense of  million represented  of revenue in q versus  million or  a year ago sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars grew  yearonyear as we invest thoughtfully in sales and marketing headcount and programs we remain focused on capturing the current market share opportunity balanced by careful attention to sales productivity ga expense were  million or  of revenue in q versus  million or  of revenue a year ago ga expenses  spend grew  on a yearonyear basis driven primarily by increased spend on legal outside services and finance as we scaled and continue to grow our business total headcount at the end of q was over  up from over  at the end of q and up from over  a yearago turning to operating margin we continue to make excellent progress in our drive to profitability and toward our longterm operating margin goal of between  and  for q nongaap operating loss was  million or negative  of revenue compared to nongaap operating losses  million or negative  of revenue in the yearago quarter this represents an  percentage point improvement in operating margin yearonyear and  percentage point improvement sequentially we are making significant progress in making this fiscal year our turning point in terms of absolute operating losses operating losses in absolute dollars have decreased by  million yeartodate over the same period last year  ahead of our flat yearonyear operating loss guidance from the beginning of the year our nongaap net loss for the quarter was  million or negative  per share this compares to the yearago quarter nongaap net loss of  million or negative  per share the weighted average shares used for the per share calculations were  million and  million respectively for those of you comparing to our q fiscal  period please note that the share count numbers used to calculate net loss per share in that period assumed the conversion of all of our preferred stock at the beginning of the quarter please note that for q fiscal  our nongaap operating loss nongaap operating margin nongaap net loss and nongaap net loss per share also exclude a  million onetime cash charge related to a legal settlement moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow we finished the october quarter with cash and investments of  million our free cash flow was negative  million or negative  of revenue compared to negative  million or negative  of revenue in the year ago quarter please note that this includes  million of an impact related to our employee stock purchase plans excluding this amount free cash flow would have been negative  million or negative  of revenue for q fiscal  our free cash flow also excludes the  million onetime cash payment related to the legal settlement i mentioned above lets turn now to our q guidance we are experiencing seasonality consistent with last year strong topline growth in our second half driven by sales investments we made in our first half as a result our operating margin tends to be stronger in the second half relative to the first half with that in mind for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we expect revenues between  million and  million driven by several key dynamics we are entering a seasonally strong period for our business we have excellent repeat purchase rate across our entire customer base we are now one of the top  vendors in storage and we are seeing many more deals today than we were a year ago our partner momentum remains strong fuelled by a geographically diverse combination of partners who are increasing their commitments with pure and perhaps most important we have a superior storage portfolio moving strongly into understructured data with a software advantage that customers value with regard to revenue contribution from flashblade for this fiscal year ill remind investors that while we are excited about the longterm opportunities for this product revenue contribution is not expected to be significant in the near future turning to gross margins we expect q nongaap gross margins in the range of between  and  with the initial manufacturing ramp of flashblade behind us our overall gross margin has now stabilized this performance fits within our longterm model of between  and  gross margin and we remain focused on execution in this area we expect q nongaap operating margins of between negative  and negative  as we continue to drive absolute operating losses lower yearonyear in summary our q guidance implies for our current year that we will drive nearly  yearonyear revenue growth while cutting our absolute operating losses by over  we continue to manage the business towards sustained positive free cash flow in the second half of calendar year  as we drive consistently towards our longterm operating margin targets of between  and  with that we will open the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from steve milunovich from ubs your line is open steven milunovich all right thank you very much last quarter i think you talked about pushing expenses forward into the october quarter i dont really see that i mean rd certainly did increase much sga and ga seemed kind of up with what i expected so did that not happen is that yet to come or is that really embedded in those numbers timothy riitters steve this is tim what youre seeing really in q is the leverage that we talked about here in the earlier remarks and so thats dropping a lot of that is dropping to the bottom line which we expected im always on the lookout i think were always on the lookout here for good quality count on rd but were kind of happy where we are right now with the opex for q and then the implied guide out in the q as well steven milunovich okay and then scott i wonder if you could talk a little bit about your position relative to the hyper converged options particularly nutanix do you compete against them and what do you view as your advantages scott dietzen thanks steve so we do see hyper converged in a low single percent of our  of our singledigit percent of our deals pure is competing for the more strategic data that our customers have and where we see hyper converged sweet spot if you look at the report weve actually cited on the blog that’s  by their measure of the hyper converged deployments in the world are for remote and branch offices in vdi which is not the most business critical data in the data center the larger data centers very much tend to specialize their infrastructure into multitier there is an application and compute tier and then there is a separate data and storage tier that combination provides additional scale additional performance and actually better economics because you can refresh and scale the compute and storage tiers independently of one another and maybe ill pass the baton here to matt kixmoeller who can provide some more color matt kixmoeller yes the only thing i would add is that i think its important to remind us that hyper converged was born in the era of disk and so the whole base architectural assumption was there would be lots of cheap disk you could throw in servers and you can kind of get a storage layer for free i think the challenge with that i think you know is thats ultimately quite a compromised storage layer it doesnt have the performance doesnt have the scale and resiliency that enterprise customers expect and so we really see this plan in new spaces that dietz mentioned earlier and a remote office vditype use cases as opposed to the mission critical data intensive analytics and business applications that pure tends to serve scott dietzen and i guess i would add four cloud and enterprise its where were less likely to see hyper converged infrastructure steven milunovich great thank you scott dietzen thank you operator your next question is from aaron rakers from stifel your line is open aaron rakers yes thanks a couple of real quick questions if i can first i want to touch on the gross margin you talked about getting through the initial ramp a flashblade i think that was expected to be about a  basis point negative impact this last quarter so as we look at the guidance is that  basis points kind of lifting out and in that how do we think about the current trends that were seeing on nand flash pricing as it relates to your gross margin in the current quarter or even thereafter as weve seen continued price increases out in the market and then i do have a followup timothy riitters yes so aaron this is tim and i think on your observations on flashblade youre absolutely correct were through that first phase now flashblade margins where we want to be  now flashblade will become a bigger part of the overall revenue so that also factors in the gross margin and thats why we got it the way we did as it relates to the overall cost of goods sold or the nand pricing you talk about we have seen some nand increases but i think as weve said in calls before and ill reiterate here weve got  strategic supplier relationships across many of the manufacturers that have allowed us to go out and source the most cost effective nand for the job which weve done so weve modeled all of that into our pipeline and im really confident in terms of what were seeing in terms of maintaining and keeping that gross margin right where we wanted right where we guided aaron rakers okay scott dietzen and maybe ill add on on that topic from the outset we designed our products to allow us to plug and play the flash from different vendors and were using the same consumer grade flash that goes into mobile devices and laptops which gives us a much broader supply that we can access so we feel like were in a very strong position in fact we think were in a well better position than our competition maybe matt has some thoughts on that matt kixmoeller yes just to double click there if you look at the traditional pure deal because of our advantage in the data reduction software our competitors will often have to configure between two and four x more flash just to get the same usable amount of flash for the customer and so that puts them at a much riskier position when you look at any kind of supply stock in the system those prices rise its going to  really we think clean out the market and kind of put the hurt on them just doing these kind of lowcost deals to try to compete with pure scott dietzen and these blips are very much part of normal operations we move through them the broad trend line is that flash prices will continue to drop in the quarters and years ahead and that only brings more of the market to us aaron rakers okay and then just  i guess kind of following up a little bit on a competitive comments made there i mean weve seen a lot of talk about emc and the positioning of their flash solution obviously now being a little bit tougher to see that under the dell umbrella but there has been some discussion in the market about the repositioning or lack ph of the extreme io product relative to the offflash or vmax product so id be curious of what youre seeing competitively from emc post the dell transaction and in particular as it relates to extreme io versus lets say the vmax or flash offering scott dietzen aaron dell emc of course remains our most frequent competitors thrilled to say that in the quarter our win rates overall held strong as good as theyve been in a year and our win rates specifically against dell emc we maintained a twothirds poc win rate that weve historically enjoyed now i think we are benefiting from the fact that the combined entity has nine different all flash storage offerings and thats creating some confusion in the field about which tech for which solution i will say broadly in our own experience we are seeing a lot more of flash vmax then we are extreme io todate possible that moves overtime but its certainly seems that their cadence has shifted there i would say the biggest opportunity uptake weve seen is committed cisco channel partners that really want to bring in our products that they proceed to be longterm friendly the cisco networking and cisco compute and so our flashstack is enjoying triple digit growth as a result of that aaron rakers thank you scott dietzen tim anything you wanted to add timothy riitters no i think thats good aaron rakers perfect thanks guys good luck operator your next question comes from kathryn huberty from morgan stanley your line is open kathryn huberty thanks for the questions and congrats on the quarter the profitability upside at the back half tim how are you thinking about that flowing through into the next couple of years and in particular are you thinking that you hit profitability at quarter two earlier than you would have thought a quarter ago timothy riitters i think katy its too early to tell again as you  we might imagine were not going to guide going out but what i will say is that q and q is really when we reap the rewards of those investments that we make and this has been a game plan that we followed for the last several years now so i think into  the first half becomes  that growth or that investment portion of the business as well as we go back out to the last half or well see those rewards come again so i think nothing fundamentally has changed in terms of how we think about the investment and then the return cycle in the business kathryn huberty okay now that you have another quarter of flashblade under your belt how youre thinking about the incremental tam that adds to your business and what  you know what made that contribution to growth next year look like from that product in particular matt kixmoeller yes katy this is kix we did a blog post about a month ago now updating our tam with a result of the number of the expansions that weve done recently including flashblade to restate that to a  billion target market and id say as weve gotten into the first three quarters now it should be in flashblade we really have been enthused and encouraged by the wide variety of used cases so when we first started we began really positioning the product for some high end used cases or analytics software development chip design as we had a quarter now really coming on with a broader salesforce i think weve been excited to see the diversity so if you look at this last quarter weve seen online gaming a great example where the online experience plus the kind of creative development experience or both accelerated by flashblade medical imaging and pox ph whole new area security log analysis ias and service rate environments so were just kind of  i think continue to have confidence in the breadth of used cases in the platforms going on and its still just really early days scott dietzen so and  were proving out that time to value in the key verticals that we are targeting and were ontrack to hit general availability this quarter which was always part of the plan but were going to avoid making specific guidance for next years performance of flashblade at this time kathryn huberty and just generally speaking would you expect a material revenue contribution in the first half of next year or is it more back half weighted scott dietzen so katy i appreciate where youre headed with the question but again this is just too early to guide next year were happy with the momentum but its still really is early days liz lemon its a good effort though katy i admire that kathryn huberty okay thank you very much operator your next question comes from simona jankowski from goldman sachs your line is open unidentified analyst hi this is mack ph on behalf of simona i guess i wanted to circle back to one of the earlier questions about the competitive landscape i heard the commentary about emc but it also seems like now netapp is running over  billion of all flash revenue hpe is upto about  million or so over run rate so im just curious if youve seen any change and how often youre going up against those two and what you feel your real competitive advantage are against both of those scott dietzen so again no  no material change to the competitive environment we have maintained our win rate weve been going up against all flash for multiple years now all of the core competitors took the effort to swap out the mechanical disc in their legacy systems and put in flash you know the key thing is that doesnt change the challenges right those platforms are still too slow too siloed ph and too expensive so pure is competing for the most strategic data in the enterprise because were able to do things that our customers cant do with the legacy retrofitted products and youre seeing that in our success in the market in our overall growth i would say the best way to look at this market is not just growth in the flash business but compare that relative to the overall companys performance so if somebodys flash business is growing but their overall business is shrinking in doubledigits then really all they are doing is share shifting inside of a shrinking installed base which is not compelling going forward so i would say that were very happy with where our win rates are now but if you look forward i think we have the wind at our backs in a sense that flasharray demand is holding strong and weve got the nvme differentiator just now coming to market and flashblade ramping with  there is just nothing like flashblade out there in the market and that is a huge and growing tam thats going to continue to shift our way as flash prices fall matt kixmoeller one extra comments from kix here i would say if you look at the discussions weve been having technically with customers over the last couple of quarters two net new things i would say the flashblade discussion has materially even held the flasharray business and at the end of the day every customer has both structured and unstructured data and the product is just so strategic also if you look at the competition there has just really been anemic ph response netapp really hasnt responded at all emc recently came out with a version of isilon where its simply retrofitted big slow ssps and the existing isilon products and so we really feel like the combination of flasharray and flashblade is changing that longer term strategy discussion around flash and then the second thing id say is this path indiscernible becoming real for customers you know one of the things that i think i was recently talking with the gartner analyst and he said look i think the customer race is finally starting to internalize the rapid pace of change of flash and this isnt the threefive year cycle anymore you have to invest in an architecture ph thats always going to evolve and were showing that very clearly with some announcements weve recently made with nvme nvme transition is going to happen faster than people think and were out there really differentiate our platform being built for nvme today so that customers understand that they are investing in a platform that absolutely can be upgraded to the latest and greatest flash next year unidentified analyst got it and then just a quick followup i just wanted to clarify that the  million legal settlement in the quarter that was all cash and that was the big drag ph and free cash flow i just wanted to clarify that and then  im sorry if i missed this earlier but i just wanted to make sure that youre still ontrack to hit free cash flow breakeven in the second half of the calendar year timothy riitters so matt tim here on free cash flow so  yes we did make the  million payment to legal settlement in the quarter it has been stripped out at the fcf numbers that you saw in the presentation so that  that excludes that calculus but if you look at our overall cash balance change  million actually did have to do with the legal settlement and then on terms of cash flow positive no change in that still signaling sustained cash flow positive in end of calendar  towards the end of calendar  unidentified analyst thank you operator your next question is from alex kurtz with pacific crest your line is open alexander kurtz yes thanks for taking the question guys tim back on the questions that aaron was asking around product margin would you say that that  basis point estimate on the flashblade impacts were played down the quarter timothy riitters yes i was in that ballpark certainly the majority of the change alex is indeed due to flashblade alexander kurtz and you know should we be thinking about a similar kind of impact as you scale the flashblade business in the january quarter here and start to think about product margins maybe in the same levels because of that timothy riitters yes so weve guided the implied midpoint of our guidance is about flat quarteronquarter and i think thats exactly it i mean youre going to see flashblade become a bit of a bigger portion of the overall revenue its gross margin is going to probably improve as well so i think when you scroll those together you get kind of that stabilization that weve seen and that the other thing that i look at is i look at overall momentum in the business on the flasharray business on a gross margin business i think one of the important takeaways here is that the gross margin business that we were writing at the end of the quarter was stronger than the gross margin that we are writing at the beginning of the quarter and really  go ahead alexander kurtz no just to tie this into the service margin discussion with scott for a second around competitive opportunity so it looks like youre improving your efficiency on the services side which is going to give you some flexibility if services margins continues to trend up here into the middle of s ph are you going to use that opportunity to take some margin from services and apply to product to go out through some incremental accounts is that how youre thinking about it timothy riitters yes this is tim again alex you know thats very deliberately why weve guided the overall gross margin number the way we have  you will note that we dont guide between product or support because weve got the leverage and the capability to do a variety of things as you alluded to the things outside to point out is we are bestinclass in product margins and bestinclass in gross margins a lot of our competitors have numbers that have fives or fours in front of them and so were really proud of that it speaks for the differentiate of the technology and gives us that flexibility to go out and capture share and grow the business alexander kurtz all right thank you timothy riitters thanks operator your next question comes from rod hall with jp morgan your line is open unidentified analyst hi this is warkey ph on behalf of rod thanks for taking my questions i have one question and one followup if i may could you let us know what led to the upside in that quarter in terms of both revenue as well as the ebit margins scott dietzen yes on the revenue side it really comes down to demand and it comes down to demand on both the product or on the  on the flasharray product and the flashblade product we had sort of good momentum on both of them really good solid sales productivity and pipeline generation capabilities in the quarter and so again its really a testament to the technology and the quality of the product and service offering that we have in the business and then on the bottom line a handful of things id point out to number one naturally upside on the revenue side will drive to the bottom line which certainly helped the bottom line and then were starting to get some benefits in leverage in terms of productivity that i talked to and alluded to and then the other thing i would say is were now starting to see reductions in some of our legal spend as well as a function of settling the trail unidentified analyst okay great also i wanted to make a clarification about flashblade i think last quarter you alluded to flashblade revenues being material next year i wanted to confirm if thats true or not and if so if youre recreating it now scott dietzen no what we said was that flashblade was not material for the current fiscal year and that we were not offering guidance on flashblade out into the next year so calendar  so if you want to make it clear on that were not providing any guidance on flashblade any further then  or not at all into  unidentified analyst okay and could you give us any indication on how much lower flashblade gross margins are compared to your flasharray scott dietzen we dont provide that and the reason being its early days we talked a little bit about this on the last call very similar to happens with our  series products in the old days and the mseries product there is a ramp  a manufacturing ramp and so its really until we hit the stability that we would start talking about flashblade gross margins the other thing i would say in flashblade gross margins they will run right in our longterm margin targets overtime its just a question of getting it ramped up over the next couple of quarters unidentified analyst okay and lastly whether any other factors like  other than flashblade like international makes or pricing which impacted your gross margins this quarter scott dietzen no the predominance was again flashblade gross margins its that what we have talked about and signaled it came in largely as we expected unidentified analyst okay great thank you operator your next question comes from simon leopold with  from raymond james your line is open simon leopold great thank you for taking my question you made a comment in the prepared remarks about the fourth quarter seasonality im wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you anticipate for seasonality longer term and really the basis for the question is not simply to get guidance for fiscal  but to get a better understanding of how to think about the cadence through the year because when i look back at the april  quarter it was a negative  sequential versus the april  quarter that was  sequential rise so moving in opposite directions with current consensus indicating that the expectations for first fiscal quarters are down quarter  i just want to get a better understanding of whats  what are the drivers as its related to things like sales incentives or customer behavior help us understand what seasonality to expect thank you timothy riitters yes simon great question in terms of seasonality enterprise storage has always been a very very seasonable business q tends to be the weakest quarter q tends to be the strongest quarter and thats why you typically see most companies have this sequential decline what that really is driven on is its a largely to do with part to customer buying behavior so the classic budget flush at the end of the quarter and then the starting of the new quarter but i think youre thinking about it absolutely correct and the other thing i would say is that as we think forward again were not offering guidance for next year but as we think forward weve got two dynamics in the business going on weve got  kind of what i call the secular growth which has been growing very very fast hyper growth and then the seasonal trend which has always been there and so what i  how i think about it here internally is that that seasonal growth trend will always be there and that circular growth trend will be slowing down its natural in terms of large numbers and just factoring that into your over and thinking how youre thinking about the modelling simon leopold great i appreciate that scott dietzen sorry what  i mean i agree with tim its predominantly customer behavior that the end of the year is the time that storage is purchased we do have the extra impact that in q were ramping new hires into our salesforce thats when we add the most people and were rejittering ph territories and segmentation and so on and so thats another reason that q is likely not to be as strong as q so we would expect that same seasonality that we experienced last year to occur again next year simon leopold and just in terms of your october quarter do you have material federal exposure and is that a factor in terms of your october quarter performance and trending into the january quarter timothy riitters yes your federal quarter the october quarter is always the federal quarter their buying cycles youre spoton there we have a nice federal business our statelocal government business as well and so thats some of the dynamics that youre seeing and why q was a bit stronger than q simon leopold great thank you for the help on that timothy riitters absolutely operator your next question comes from menal ph from wells fargo your line is open unidentified analyst hi thank you so regarding this  million settlement in the quarter i just want to  steven ph clarified that  are you making any ongoing quarterly payments as part of the settlement i guess im trying to figure out whether or not that had any impact on the gross margins other than the quarter going forward and then if you can help us quantify the opex benefit if im not mistaken i think the last time a legal issue went to court i think there was an associated increase in opex related to legal fees that i think might have been  million or  million but if you can help us with the quantification that would be helpful thanks timothy riitters its tim on your first question of the  million all rearview mirror so nothing in gross margin no ongoing royalty payments we are completely closed off on that topic and then on a goforward basis in terms of legal spend id like to offer a specific number but as you saw in some of the leverage in our guidance q relatively to where consensus was it was born about less expenses from a legal perspective so it does make a difference on the bottom line and one of the reasons why were happy to put this behind us unidentified analyst great and then just lastly you talked about flash pricing dropping helping you as more of the market starts to come to you but can you just talk about your expectations for when you expect to start seeing more material declines in flash pricing because weve seen the nand pricing actually going flat to up more recently so im just wondering when you expect that will start to help you more significantly thanks timothy riitters yes our earlier comments were actually in reference to i guess my anticipated questions about bit of a supply bubble thats happening right now so were anticipating slight increases over the next few quarters those tend to be seasonal and nothing were critically worried about writing out and as we said earlier we have multiple suppliers weve architected our product for that from day one and because of our superior data reduction technologies we believe were much much less impacted by any shifts in nand price in some of our competitors who rely on low cost pricing and raw ph flash to win scott dietzen and just to be clear the trend we were outlining is a very longterm trend that we believe that cost will continue to come down for flash as we see more capacity ramp just because its  an explosively growing business unidentified analyst great thank you scott dietzen thank you operator our next question comes from jayson noland from baird your line is open jayson noland okay great thank you scott i wanted to ask about your blog post where you say nvme will be as big as all flasharray and you mentioned an all nvme array could you talk a little bit about the timing and any required investment on the part of here ph scott dietzen so were going to avoid making new product announcements at this particular juncture but i would say we have been making rd investments as i prepare for that all nvme future for more than  months now and so we are tracking to our longterm plan and we absolutely believe this is going to be a profound differentiator in terms of how much value customers can extract from their data how many different applications can use that data how much more realtime analytics we can accommodate so we are shipping nvme technology in the current flasharray end product and we have providing our customers within investment protecting path that will nondisruptive to their business to get the full benefits of all nvme going forward and i think were the only major storage vendor doing that matt kixmoeller just to give you a little more clarity on why we think this is going to be so disruptive if you look at the way most storage arrays are built today all flasharrays they use sas technology serial attached scsi so the first s there is serial that means that kind of a single pointtopoint link from cpus down to the flash moving to nvme literally gives you  parallel queues and so it really helps us take advantage of multicore cpus connected to massive amounts of flash and as we move to these denser and denser all flasharrays that becomes critical and so you first of all need a hard work that actually can support that and we of course own our entire hard work and sure design that from scratch but more importantly you really need the software technology they will take advantage of it you cant just plug it in and exploit that parallelism easily and so we believe this is a pretty major transformation its one that we saw coming anticipated three years ago when we started building flasharray and kind of build nvme from the start and its one that we intend to lead the transformation industry around and so as scott says were not ready to enter ph new product set but like we said from the early days of flasharraym weve built the  build for that upgrade to come within the product already and we anticipate taking customers there in a totally nondisruptive fashion scott dietzen and we think this is going to be a substantial challenge and hurdle for our competitors that are starting the legacy technology it is likely a multiyear software rewrite as well  thats for the vendor and then for the customer it is a repurchase of the storage as well as a data migration so theyre going to sacrifice investment whereas our customers get to preserve investment and its better across the boards its going to allow us to deliver a lot more technology in a smaller foreign factor so were not just going to be able to add more performance were going to be able to cut cost of our customer infrastructure with this technology timothy riitters and one final thing ill add we really are excited about this not only because of the customer benefit but we view it as tam expansionary if you look over the last few  maybe call it five years many of the newer skill kind of web generation applications were built in a world of local data storage nvme allows us to go in and attack that market now with a shared storage footprint we can take those local ssps those local flash cards out of those servers and replace them with a shared array that offers all the benefits and so from a customers point of view its just kind of best of both worlds they can potentially get the performance of local flash into the server but all the benefits of manageability reliability and economics of a shared environment jayson noland okay i appreciate the color on that and then a followup on international it looks like you saw strong growth yearonyear which market is that coming out of and is it a trend that we should expect to continue timothy riitters yes on international we had momentum in a number of markets i guess id highlighted two of them we talked about telecom italia on the call a named customer reference in europe very very strong momentum there our sales leader james petter in emea did a phenomenal job in terms of growing that region in general another one i call out is germany we installed a new leader there recently and had a very very strong big win in a large german financial services firm as well so a lot of things kicking on all cylinders both there as well as the apj market as well scott dietzen you know there is so much addressable market globally and we were so excited with the prospects that we have to continue to expand i would say we have to continue to get better in our consistency we have countries that are exploding we have others that are still ramping and so we just got to keep doing our work and you will see that international growth continue in the years ahead jayson noland thanks guys operator your next question comes from eric martinuzzi from lake street capital your line is open eric martinuzzi thanks you commented a little bit on the gross margin linearity in q what about the revenue linearity timothy riitters revenue linearity in terms of  in quarter eric or just trying to get to understanding that question eric martinuzzi within the quarter i mean typically i was thinking october quarter would be very  kind of septemberoctober loaded with doldrums in the summer months what did you see timothy riitters thats exactly thats the dynamic weve seen for several years is that particularly some of our international market  august is a very slow time just because people are away and so i think youve characterized it perfectly consistent sort of behavior that weve seen in years past as well eric martinuzzi okay and then also for the services side of the house i know your  the primary support revenue is around maintenance contracts but as far as professional services to the extent that youre performing for services is that similar as well timothy riitters yes and pure services as you alluded to  very very small portion of the business the vast majority of the number you see on that line is just amortization of the support contracts scott dietzen and key part of our practice is we try to encourage the services business to go to our partners because its a key place for them to add value around our product offerings eric martinuzzi i understand thank you operator your next question comes from tim long with bmo capital markets your line is open tim long thank you two questions if i could just followingup on the services line you talked earlier about the gross margin having flexibility between the businesses but youve had a nice ramp in the services line is there more runway there for you to play with and then separately just curious on the  you said the win rates been pretty stable despite some of the incumbents maybe catching up with all flasharray products anything standout as far as win rates by different verticals or geographies or is there any area that you think your win rates are little bit better than the competitors and more defensible thank you timothy riitters its tim on the first question is there a leverage in the support number ill give you just a very short and simple answer yes youve seen that grow very very nicely overtime and we still see line of sight that sort of greater things there scott dietzen and on win rates it is consistent right so were measuring across all of our competitive engagements and all gos ph and you know the fact that those win rates are holding strong is reflective of our performance broadly i just want to hit again the differentiation gap is not closing you take these legacy and community storage platforms and you put flash into them they are still too slow they are too siloed ph and they are too expensive and too complicated they do not do the things that pure does thats why weve been able to sustain these win rates for the past couple of years despite the competition doing the best and thats why were growing and our competitors are shrinking in their overall market footprint tim long okay thank you operator our next question comes from james kisner from jefferies your line is open james kisner thank you i just want to tell scott i think you must have misread the script because you didnt mention jefferies as an important new customer but can you talk about linearity in the quarter dsos are spiking up a bit last october dsos went down i think separately also in gross margin if flashblade were excluded from your guidance would you have expected margins to be up or flat for product i was hoping to be up given the flash that would be  i guess actually this will be flat if were not seeing the pricing pressure thanks timothy riitters yes james on your first question so from a dso perspective dso just in terms of timing of billing as you alluded to can go up and down a little bit the internal metric that we use a weighted average days to pay and thats been nice and stable it sort of gives me confidence that the overall business is performing well as it relates to gross margin what ill say again is that yes weve hit that period of stability were happy where the flasharray margins are right now and flashblade will blend in very nicely as reflected in our guidance scott dietzen and james thank you so much for working in the product ph were extremely grateful to have you as a customer as well james kisner thank you very much operator your next question comes from richard kugele from needham  company your line is open richard kugele thank you good afternoon just one last technology question on nvme you know as you said you have been shipping it in systems that are capable but what is the inflection point this year that makes  or this coming year that makes nvme sort of like adopted and is there any of work that has to happen on the customer end in order to make that and then tim if you could just talk about the hiring plans for next year relative to what happened this year thanks timothy riitters yes so on the nvme first of all just to clarify how weve been shipping it when we first shipped flasharraym we actually built our own dual port nvme and we ran devices so every catching device in our product since flasharraym shipped have been dualported nvme devices we also lay the groundwork on the product kind of the plumbing if you will to support nvme flash drives for the bulk storage and so weve been kind of anticipating this transition what we think is going to push the transition is the adoption of nvme across the broad industry especially in the consumer space consumer demand always pushes flash and so if youve bought a modern laptop recently if you bought a brand new phone its got nvme flash inside and so that transition is starting to happen where the entire industry is gearing over towards the nvme as the volume product and then the third reason i think is just the better gateway to open up and create a next level of industry for data and if you look at our highest end customers that are trying to do things havent been done before in the data path this opens up the next level of performance and its just good for the industry and so as a leader we intend to push it because we believe the customer impact is going to hugely positive scott dietzen this is one of a very pragmatic consideration if you just look at ssds in the data center when pure got started they were just  gigabytes and now the ssds that are used can range from  terabytes upto  terabytes and the road map to go well higher than that the problem with the interconnects that we have for those ssds is that they are just way too slow so the capacities have gone up a fold and we are still stuck with the same access model and so that has to be replaced otherwise we cant continue to scale and drive density and density is  is what allows you to mine a lot more value from data so nvme is coming along at the perfect time to allow us to continue to advance the data platform timothy riitters and two other things ill just say about kind of the way we do things at pure one is that we believe in making flash massmarket technologies and so in the early days of pure flash was just highend exotic thing people thought it was only for the  of storage used cases and we really broke the market open by making it mainstream and let others flow in that strategy we intend to take the same path with nvme and be very aggressive about allowing it to really hit a broad swap ph of the market and then the second thing is we really believe in anonymous upgrade path and so customer shouldnt have to ditch their first generation storage of flasharray and move to brand new all flasharray to support the nvme and so we built that transformation right in when we look at our competitors lets pick on  lets say emc for a minute they are following the opposite strategy right theyve got a protocol dssd and so the uber ph highend of the market from the cost of performance perspective and its complete island in terms of upgradability from any other eight odd old flasharray scott dietzen and rich i want to make sure we cover off on your question around sort of investment and how we think about next year obviously too early there to talk about guidance but ill give you a framework about how we think about it and really its the playbook and we talked a little bit early on the call about it if that playbook of invest early and then reap the rewards in the latter half of the year its when the best sales people are coming available to us they are coming off of a good year somewhere else and well pull them up so i think in terms of just sequencing and seasonality of investments youre going to see this coming year be very similar to how you have seen years past its also when we have our big demand generation events our user conference which was a significant success for us last year were going to do that again this year so thats how to think about investments as we get in the next year richard kugele great thank you operator your next question comes from john lucia from jmp securities your line is open john lucia hey guys thanks for taking my question you announced an expansion of your cisco partnership in midoctober and youve talked about triple digit growth with that partnership can you just touch on the cisco partnership and whats driving the momentum there in the longer term and what kind of opportunities does cisco represent as a partner for you timothy riitters yes so i guess id start with – there is an absolute segment of the market that once the indiscernible solutions and you know its a full stock kind of mentality customers wanted endtoend tested solutions thats designed for the highest end kind of environments and so when we first looked at this market space a few years ago we really saw the first generation of ci solutions built in the era of disk theyre more particularly efficient and they were pretty complex and there was huge kind of services wrap around getting them to work and so we saw an opportunity to do a lot of stimulation we did in flash base for ci in general to go in to bring flash to make it more efficient and just modernize for nextgeneration sort of applications so weve seen a lot of positive here and there i said other thing thats important to realize is that there is lot of pull of ci from the channel because what the channel partners want to do they want to sell complete solutions to their customers and so ci makes that easy and id say now this transition particularly in the channel around the dellemc merger were seeing a lot of excitement around flashstack and wanting to look towards the next generation of ci solutions scott dietzen and its why we have invested to make pure as channel friendly or partner friendly a storage company as an industry because it is such a great opportunity for us to align with these committed cisco partners that are looking for storage that fits very well into the overall solutions john lucia okay in the press release you talked about thousands of deployments for cisco that would suggest its a pretty large partnership can you give us any sense for the relative size of the partnership with cisco scott dietzen so when you talk about thousands of deployments we do indeed have thousands of configurations where pure storage is interconnecting with cisco systems and then we also sell this converged infrastructure where the technology is combined before it goes into the customer site so both of those are key parts of our business right we sell independently and our infrastructure gets used our platform gets used along with cisco systems but then through our channel in particular a lot of our customers are buying flashstack converged infrastructure its that flashstack converged infrastructure thats growing at triple digit rates right now john lucia okay thank you operator your next question comes from line of mehdi hosseini from susquehanna your line is open mehdi hosseini thanks two followup questions for scott can you help me understand how the cost per gigabyte for your customers are changing so we can better understand the value you are creating and i have a followup scott dietzen sorry so how the cost is changing per gigabyte mehdi hosseini yes the effective cost per gigabyte including the dutification ph and all the proprietary savings that you provide for the customer scott dietzen yes so i think the best proxy for that mehdi is that our product margins are stable so what that means is as we slowly drive down cost in our supply chain we are handing some of those savings along to our customers and that we continue to drive the industrys most efficient technology in terms of having the best data reduction and the most efficient ratio indiscernible that will allow us to get the most mileage out of common hardware so we dont specifically publish dollars per gigabyte but i would say our customers purchase the storage based on how much data they can store on it not how much flash that comes with the device mehdi hosseini okay and then moving on to my second question which is more of a bigger picture i understand your commentary about the hyper converged its entirely different than what youre doing but how is the hyper converged could be like a hundred plus billion tam your focus on    billion tam in that context are you just being very diligent with your rd dollar and focused on your next twothree year road map because i see both converged and hyper converged coexisting but hyper converged could be a much bigger tam and i get a feeling that you just want to stay focused but why not think about the bigger picture such in longer terms so i want to better understand your thought process is it just being diligent with the rd dollar or and then  not wanting to encroach into other tam or its just something else timothy riitters maybe were extremely excited about our target market you know being the preferred platform for our customers most strategic data the data that they are seeking to mine the most value from we think is a supremely large terrific market opportunity maybe the biggest available market opportunity we see growth in cloud were substantially exposed to cloud software the service  infrastructure of the service as well as consumer cloud company were seeing great growth in the fortune  so i would say were right where we want to be and playing for a market that we think is growing and tipping in our direction mehdi hosseini good thank you operator your next question comes from steven fox of cross research your line is open steven fox yes just one quick one for me please looking at your sga expenses for the closing like it was a decent amount unless i was thinking i could be off but i was wondering if you maybe realizing that normal amount of sales productivity during the quarter or if there were some spending that was deferred or maybe thats about where you expected it to be thanks timothy riitters steve this is tim i think largely were expected to be  i think you know the rd line could have been up a little bit and then we did start seeing some savings and kind of what we call outside services or professional services as our legal spend starts winding down a little bit steven fox okay so productivity is pretty much tracking as you thought overall from a salesforce standpoint timothy riitters were happy with productivity yes steven fox okay thank you operator there are no further questions i will now turn the call  now turn it over to scott dietzen for the closing remarks scott dietzen thank you operator thanks for your time today were tremendously excited about the position were in pures data platform is allowing our customers to extract value from data they cant get from any other solution were big were fast were easy were elastic and we have the lowest total cost of ownership of any other solutions in the marketplace more importantly were uniquely capable of building the most data intensive applications and supporting many different apps all using that data simultaneously the legacy and commodity storage we compete against is too slow its too siloed ph its too complicated and its too expensive flasharray demand is strong and with nvme its poised to tip the scales further our way flashblade is just ramping now into a huge and growing tam as ive mentioned earlier as flash prices decline overtime evermore of that big data market opportunity is going to tip in our direction with our platforms well differentiated operating at scale one of the biggest if not the biggest available market intact the future is incredibly bright in front of pure we want to wish you a happy holidays were very grateful to have your time and well see you in three months cheers operator that is the end of todays
