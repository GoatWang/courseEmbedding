 of the most adaptive companies by stephen d simpson cfa  march   —  am edt share adaptation and survival often go hand in hand true some companies such as cocacola nyseko can figure out one thing do it extremely well and enjoy success for decade after decade for other major companies though continued prosperity has come from management teams willing to see a different future for the company and unafraid of making large scale changes to the enterprise for related reading also take a look at behind the big brands tutorial economic indicators to know  dupontdupont nysedd is a great starting point when talking about companies that have adapted over time now known as one of the worlds largest chemical companies dupont got its start in gunpowder dupont was so successful in gunpowder in fact that the company supplied something like half of the unions needs during the civil war from its origins in explosives dupont ultimately added other businesses like lacquers and synthetic rubber before inventing the first polyesters nylon teflon and the first phenothiazine insecticide along the way the company continued to pioneer new plastics and synthetics but also products in fields like crop science seeds and fertilizers healthcare electronics and nutrition in many cases dupont has been the first in the field to develop a new compound or product and the company continues to support a rare commitment to rd for a company of its size and age  hewlettpackardfrom its legendary start in a garage in palo alto hewlettpackard nysehpq has changed a lot over the years starting off with audio oscillators the company quickly expanded into a range of electronic test equipment products like voltmeters oscilloscopes wave analyzers and so on it wasnt really until the s and s that hp started to look more like the hp of today the test equipment business was spun off with agilent nysea in  at that point the company added products like computers and calculators before expanding in the s s and s into printers storage services and so on  nokiareaders may argue that dupont has always been a chemical company gunpowder and explosives are chemicals after all and hewlettpackard has always been an electronics firm fair enough but what of nokia nysenok known now as the worlds largest cell phone maker nokia started off as a pulpandpaper company in the mids before expanding into power generation around  nokia ultimately added operations in fields like rubber and telephone equipment and cables through a merger in the s even more diversification followed bringing the company into markets like televisions computers plastics and so on as time went on though the company increasingly saw better opportunities in telephony electronics and radio products and ultimately combined these into mobile communications once the company realized the potential of its mobile communications products it began to divest and sell those other operations and nokia became what it is today  a company focused on telecommunications technology tutorial the greatest investors  berkshire hathawaythere is a lot of writing about warren buffett that characterizes him as stubborn and inflexible but that does not match the record of his stewardship at berkshire hathaway nysebrka after merging his several investment partnerships into one in  mr buffett began accumulating the stock of textile firm berkshire hathaway while buffett did try to make a go of it in the textile business he also began to expand his investments into other fields like insurance as he realized the prospects in textiles were not as rosy as he once thought through the s and into the s buffett continued to accumulate more and more insurance operations under the berkshire umbrella as well as investment positions in other companies like washington post and cocacola berkshire hathaway has maintained a position in the apparel industry but has also expanded significantly into fields like building products retailing logistics utilities and railroads to learn more about buffett see rules that warren buffett lives by  appleask someone about what they think of when they think of apple nasdaqaapl and the answer may well say a lot about that persons age anyone born before  probably still thinks reflexively of apple as a computer company  one of the pioneers of personal computers and the inventor of the stillpopular mac brand if apple had just remained a computer company though it is uncertain that the company would still even be in business it took only about a year to develop the ipod but its launch radically changed the company building on the success of this portable media player apple then effectively created the touchscreen smartphone industry before then moving on to make the tablet computer concept a real product and an actual success once just a computer company apple is now a consumer electronics giant and whatever apples next move will be nobody is expecting it to be in the traditional computer space the bottom lineadapt or die may seem like a harsh directive for corporate managers but there does seem to be a certain necessity to constantly move forward and adapt to new market opportunities whats more even decades of success are no guarantee that the future will work out  witness the bankruptcies of companies like woolworth bethlehem steel and panam adaptive companies give themselves and their shareholders multiple shots on goal if dupont had never moved past gunpowder or berkshire hathaway has stayed focused on textiles neither would be what they are today use the investopedia stock

portfolio manager asher anolic believes pricing concerns and mergerandacquisition activity will persist he looks to upcoming innovations in oncology cardiology and neurology to drive industry valuations qa an interview with portfolio manager asher anolic how did the fund and industry perform for the fiscal year ending february   the fund gained  lagging the  result of the sp® custom pharmaceuticals index both the fund and the sp industry index considerably underperformed the  result of the broadmarket sp  the fund significantly trailed its peer group average which is tied to the broader health care sector concerns about drug pricing reached a fever pitch the past year resulting in the industrys significant underperformance of the broad market driving the dialogue was a series of news articles criticizing pricing practices by specialty pharmaceutical companies as well as heightened focus on the subject leading up to the november us presidential election while one might have thought donald trumps election and his antiregulation stance would restore confidence to the industry the president shattered that hope in january when he told time magazine he wanted to lower drug prices why did the fund underperform the sp industry index the past  months in our most recent performance review i discussed three broad themes that worked against us for the six months ending august  unfortunately these factors continued to weigh on the funds relative performance leading to disappointing results for the fiscal year ending february  first the fund was poorly positioned among specialty pharma firms with falling earnings estimates these companies appeared to have low expectations coming into the first quarter of  however expectations were not low enough in the face of a jittery market as a result many firms that either missed or reported earnings in line with estimates were punished – often unfairly in my view included in this bucket was a sizable outofindex stake in teva pharmaceutical industries the funds biggest individual detractor our stake returned roughly  as tevas stock price and the firms financial results were hampered by significant concern about the pricing environment for generic drugs and the durability of the firms key multiple sclerosis drug copaxone® in addition investors thought that teva had overpaid to acquire the actavis generics business from allergan as pressure continued to mount on teva and its shares i decided to significantly reduce our stake another drawback for the fund was that investors favored stocks of moredefensive companies offering high dividend yields particularly early in the period even if these firms lacked improving underlying fundamentals this hurt the fund because i prefer to hold companies with good asset duration rather than focusing purely on dividend yield an underweighting in pharma giant merck another big relative detractor largely fit this description the stock had lagged the index for several years however it rose about  the past year as one of the firms cancer drugs showed a particularly strong benefit in patients with metastatic nonsmallcell lung cancer while a competitors drug did not based on the firms improved competitive position i increased the funds allocation to merck the past  months but remained underweighted at period end what was the third broad theme the us government began to crack down on tax inversions which held back mergerandacquisition ma activity among some largecap pharma firms including some held in the fund in addition i largely avoided smallcap firms that were either acquired or in talks to be acquired for hefty premiums because i saw too much risk irelandbased allergan was representative of these challenges allergan was among the funds largest holdings and i was hopeful that the companys planned merger with pfizer would close unfortunately the companies called off the deal in april after the us treasury announced new regulations aimed at curbing tax inversions and allergans stock sold off where did you find success i decided to avoid canadabased concordia international and underweight perrigo during the first half of the period this helped as shares of perrigo and concordia meaningfully declined generics maker perrigo and concordia – which makes drugs to treat attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder adhd cancer and asthma – had rapidly grown earnings prior to this reporting period due in part to the firms aggressive acquisition strategies i believed price competition for their key products would hurt the earnings of both firms with perrigo however i added to our position amid change in senior leadership at the company and recognition that generic woes were mostly priced into the stock i also believed the rest of the operational business was consumer focused and should be steadier over the long term with novonordisk i was concerned about the longterm pricing environment for diabetes drugmakers so i underweighted the stock and continued to reduce the funds position the past year the company cut its fullyear profit estimate and the stock was hampered further in october by falling insulin prices overall our holdings returned roughly  for the period asher what is your outlooki believe that the trump administration likely will blunt the push for legislation to regulate drug pricing yet concern about pricing will still loom in the background the industrys overcapacity combined with cheaper stilleffective therapies and a motivated intermediary in the form of pharmacy benefit managers pbms should limit pricing in an expanding number of therapeutic areas therefore i believe the traditional business model embraced by specialty pharma companies – where firms borrow to purchase assets with the aim of increasing price to show strong returns – is likely obsolete similarly major pharma firms that relied on price increases to offset volume declines on a large granular tail of aging products may find it difficult to keep up the pace at which theyve been operating in recent years largecap therapeutics companies with sizable revenue bases tend to have trouble sustaining an active internal pipeline of new drugs and could struggle to create consistent organic growth however a potential assist from the government in the form of corporate tax reform could spark large scale ma activity these deals tend to result in poor performance of the acquiring entity until synergies are realized so ive reduced exposure to companies likely to be acquirers ■  note to shareholders on april   the funds industry benchmark will change from the sp® custom pharmaceuticals index to the msci north america imi  adr custom pharmaceuticals  linked index due to new international benchmark guidelines sp® dow jones® indices has decided to stop offering its brand on custom benchmarks effective march   fidelity believes that the new msci index will continue to provide shareholders with meaningful performance comparisons asher anolic on upcoming innovation in pharma i believe the most exciting innovative events will be isolated oneoffs and launches of drugs where weve already seen the data sets in oncology usage of the class of drugs known as immunotherapies continued to expand the past year including new tumor types and earlier lines of therapy drugs currently on the market for a variety of cancer types tend to work in anywhere between onefifth and onethird of the addressable population thus for the next level of acceptance combinations with other therapies must demonstrate extended survival for a wider swath of the population in this vein  looks rather bare to me as key trials in combination with chemotherapy will come to light but the more potentially paradigmshifting events are likely to occur in  and beyond elsewhere in oncology a key treatment for multiple myeloma made inroads into the firstline metastatic setting and we are starting to see the emergence of a class of drug that repairs damage to dna and helps prevent the spread of cancer turning to cardiology  should bring additional data in large patient populations for a new class of lipidlowering drug that shows a benefit in adverse cardiac events these drugs have been approved but sales to date have been modest because insurers have been able to block uptake until more data arrives in neurology mercks newest pill to treat alzheimers disease is expected to show trial results around mid overall promising pipeline drugs from pharma companies should support valuation levels and could lead to revaluation in my view among innovators the fund has greater exposure to companies whose key innovative products dovetail with a relatively low pipeline valuation market recap the us equity bellwether sp ® index gained  for the year ending february   rising sharply in the periods final four months on renewed optimism for economic growth the beginning of the period saw improving investor sentiment amid us job gains a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the sevenyear bull uptrend intact markets tumbled briefly following brexit – the uks june vote to exit the european union –recovering quickly to settle into a flattish stretch until the november us presidential election stocks then broke out in response to donald trumps surprise victory surging to a series of new alltime highs on expectations for reflation and fiscal stimulus for the year financials  proved the topperforming sector by far riding an uptick in bond yields and a rally in banks especially postelection industrials  energy  and materials  also fared well the latter two driven by a cyclical rebound in commodity prices information technology rose  despite cooling off late in  conversely real estate and health care each returned  lagging the broad market on prospects of rising interest rates and an uncertain political and regulatory outlook respectively an improved backdrop for riskier assets curbed dividendrich

fragment us anymore than the romans needed it to cause their eventual downfall — gene roddenberry while some may consider such a discussion a waste of time more and more people are coming to the conclusion that preparations of some sort are warranted in our current troubled environment — on many fronts how much preparation individuals are willing to do is usually in direct correlation to their belief that something catastrophic could happen making life as we know it a much more difficult task it is a proven fact throughout history that when disruptions of any kind occur those who made

natural disasters such as hurricanes floods tornados volcanic eruptions solar flares earthquakes and other geophysical events possibility of wars nuclear wars nuclear reactor meltdowns and radiation fallout financial meltdown derivative debt crisis economic collapse andor bond implosion causing currencies to implode and governments to topple problems with the exploration delivery or production of oil the lifeblood of modern economies spread of disease such as the black plague or a bird flu pandemic power grid failure political anarchy or revolution racial strife or civil war electromagnetic pulse event with any of these scenarios listed above and there is a host of others i have probably not even thought about you could have localized national or global unrest and even war for an indefinite period of time depending on the scope and duration of the events an item that is not on the list — but could be equally devastating to individual families — is the loss of a job losing a job can be a catastrophic event if one is not properly prepared most families find themselves living paycheck to paycheck with little in the way of savings and almost nothing in the way of preparations for years i had brought up the issue of preparedness to a close friend of mine when i first started talking about it my friend and his wife basically blew me off but i kept bringing the topic up eventually they thought it prudent to at least get some sort of food storage together their family was accustomed to an upper middle class income and living comfortably in suburbia with their three children about a year after making their food preparations the breadwinner of the family lost his job and ended up working a series of almost minimum wage jobs trying to make ends meet he kept applying for betterpaying jobs in his field of expertise — but no matter how qualified he was nobody was interested in hiring someone at his previous salary level or his age late fifties the familys lifestyle was devastated and they eventually lost their home in a recent conversation with this friend he told me that without their food storage things would have been immeasurably more difficult he thanked me for being a good friend and pushing the issue when he and his wife weren’t listening the family is now living a greatly reduced lifestyle but keeping their heads above water and continuing with their preparations i share this story because on an individual basis there is a host of things that can happen in which being prepared could make a huge difference we often as a people in general terms take things for granted and think this or that will never happen to us in addition to a major job loss due to a myriad of reasons you could lose your health or the ability to do your job unfortunately things of this nature are happening to more and more people every day in fact im certain all of us have been affected to some degree by similar stories of friends and relatives our current state of affairs the world in general seems afflicted on so many different fronts when you look at the list above any rational person could easily see one or more of these scenarios occur within their lifetime aside from the geophysical things that seem to be going haywire and could be explained simply as the planet’s cycles there are plenty of manmade catastrophes that loom on the horizon never has the planet had as many people as it does now with increased population numbers there is increased pressure for resources this is a key point on why you want to stay invested in commodities of all kinds more countries seek nuclear devices than ever before and recent advancements in technology make this much easier than any time before in history biological and chemical weapons are also much easier to manufacture — and are being stored by an increasing number of very scary countries oil markets are tighter than ever as demand from countries like china and india increases but new supply cannot keep up with the increasing demand the financial debacle of the world economies needs no introduction to my readers in short bad times — really bad times — for any number of reasons could and probably will be coming to a location near you unless you and your family take this possibility quite seriously if and when something does happen you could very well find yourself in some extremely difficult circumstances just look at the latest news coming out of greece as reported by reuters below this is happening right now — and it’s only going to spread when the political and economic systems of entire nations collapse the consequences are devastating earlier this year pharmacies and hospitals in greece were unable to provide life saving medicines due to a shortages caused by a freeze in the flow of credit from manufacturers to distributors to patients a collapse in the country’s economy has forced many greeks to turn to black market barter economies and has left millions financially devastated with no hope of finding an income stream for the foreseeable future the credit system of the entire country is in shambles so much so that reports are emerging about food shortages and hunger within the greek prison system suggesting that serious problems in the food delivery chain have begun to materialize as nigel farage warned recently we are beginning to see the rise of extreme political parties as a consequence of the total and utter desperation of the populace today the news gets even worse greece’s regulatory authority for energy rae announced an emergency meeting to deal with what can only be construed as a telltale sign that this crisis is very rapidly reaching critical mass and may spiral out of control in the very near future greece’s power regulator rae told reuters on friday it was calling an emergency meeting next week to avert a collapse of the debtstricken country’s electricity and natural gas system “rae is taking crisis initiatives throughout next week to avert the collapse of the natural gas and electricity system” the regulator’s chief nikos vasilakos told reuters rae took the decision after receiving a letter from greece’s natural gas company depa which threatened to cut supplies to electricity producers if they failed to settle their arrears with the company you may have thought the financial collapse of  was bad that was just a warmup the main event is staring us in the face and the whole of europe has frontrow seats what is happening in europe is just a precursor for what will eventually be coming to the united states i personally witnessed what can happen within a very short period of time when food is no longer available to the public i was in my early twenties living in paris france because of an extended truckers strike the food stores were cleared out within  hours of the announcement within five days normally lawabiding citizens took to the streets and began threatening anyone who had food those with no food quickly crossed the line of sanity and started desperately looking to take food from those who had it by any means necessary these events were never properly covered by the news media what a surprise but i saw firsthand how uncivilized a socalled modern country can become within a matter of days because of a lack of food if i had not witnessed this myself i probably would not believe this could happen so easily and even as a strong young man i found myself quite frightened at times before the trucks started rolling again that particular truckers strike lasted three weeks — but it left me with a lasting impression the following are items to consider that i feel are prudent as you make your own preparations based on the problems that could potentially threaten our way of life each of the items below could fill a book but my intent is to at least get you thinking about the most important things related to being prepared  should i stay or should i go  many have already decided where they will go if and when any such disaster occurs one of the questions i get more than any other regarding this topic is should i stay in the united states or leave to another country personally i know many who have already left the united states — and they have never looked back i have been invited to their retreats in costa rica panama argentina and the caribbean islands and they seem very happy with their decision to leave this is a huge decision my hope is that the following discussion may be of some help when thinking about this topic because i travel internationally so much in my search for quality mining assets i often compare notes on my trips with other folks geologists newsletter writers etc about their travels one of the realizations you see firsthand as you travel extensively worldwide is the extreme wealth extreme poverty and extreme corruption that exists in all of its world flavors if you think the united states is corrupt you should try going to peru or bolivia or panama and if you think those countries are corrupt you haven’t see anything compared to russia haiti india or some places in africa the fact is corruption and the growing global police state is everywhere so while we certainly see much to complain about in the united states which is definitely going the wrong way fast from what i have seen in most other places on the planet the us is still less corrupt than most there are bad apples everywhere throughout politics local police fbi agents and most certainly the court system — but for every bad apple there are probably three times as many honorable people who are truly just trying to do their jobs leaving the country is a decision you must make before the event takes place due to the sheer amount of time and effort it takes to accomplish such a task you must also think about being away from family and friends who don’t share your enthusiasm to leave the country and what affect that could have on everyone over time for most i think it’s probably best to just hunker down in your own country us or canada and prepare as much as you can if you can afford a retreat cabin somewhere far away from the big cities that would probably be best — but again you still need to get there once the event occurs studies have clearly shown that once a shtf sht hits the fan event occurs you have two to three days to get to where you ultimately want to hunker down after that travel becomes extremely dangerous and it is unlikely you will reach your final destination highways will become kill zones targeted by the bad guys to a gang of armed looters who forgot to prepare or plan ahead before the event there is not a better target than an rv loaded down with stored food ammo and gold don’t be foolish and attempt travel once things have gone south if you need to get somewhere plan to leave the moment the event happens and arrive where you want to be within  hours this may require several false starts meaning the situation looked bad at first but didn’t materialize and you need to return home on your part as events start to unfold but its better to be safe than sorry if you are planning to get somewhere when an event happens military strategists know from historical accounts of what happens when governments fail or when shtf events affect a country the rule of thumb is that roads are to be avoided at all costs if you cannot afford a retreat cabin of some sort there are things you can do to hunker down in your own home first you need to stock up and find a way to defend it likeminded friends and neighbors can be a huge support network — as long as they have prepared as well there is a great book its not welledited but has solid content on how to live in your home and defend it called holding your ground preparing for defense if it all falls apart by joe nobody which in itself is a lesson in laying low this book isn’t about turning your home into a concrete bunker armed to the teeth its more about using cosmetic deception to fool wouldbe marauders into thinking your place has already been hit it includes plenty of clever techniques that go far beyond shooting back ultimately everyone must decide for themselves based on finances family concerns and individual preferences what he can or cannot do in his preparations hopefully this discussion will help you make the best choices for what is in your best interest  hope for the best but prepare for the worst this is a good motto to live by despite how you think about things individuals can still hope for the best that things can and will eventually work out but what good is your prosperity going to do if you don’t have anything to eat or a safe place to hang out for an extended period of time why not prepare while you still can — when things are readily available and can still be purchased at cheap prices the coming hyperinflation will make any such purchases beforehand look very intelligent to prepare for the worst you need a plan why are most people so against doing basic preparations that could be the difference on how they survive — or whether they survive history shows time and again that those who prepare always fare better than those who did not having a plan and being determined to act on that plan will always be the best way to handle any contingencies should they occur after disaster strikes your mind is going to be racing around like a car on a race track preplanning and having a written set of measures to take will make someone’s life go much smoother when the shtf your own personal plan is only what best fits what you are going to do during and after a disaster people should also have backup plans — plans b and c at least — because nothing ever seems to go as planned haphazard approaches to the aftermaths of catastrophes are kind of like a chicken running around without its head  prepare hour bugout bags this is an easy costeffective preparation that makes a ton of sense — no matter what happens even a small preparation like this can have an enormous impact on how you survive the first few days after any type of catastrophic event i’ll bet there were a lot of people after hurricane katrina that would have loved to have such a bag for each member of their family this could be a backpack or bag of some sort for each family member that contains all the items that individual may need during the first  hours after a disaster strikes items to include in such a bag would be toiletries important papers see below change of underwear and clothes some bottled water snacks a few bags of freezedried food that only require two cups of hot water to reconstitute within selfcontained bag water purification device metal cup and small pot for boiling water backpacker minicook stove with fuel sleeping bag towel ability to make fire flashlight with extra batteries glow sticks ground cloth tarp rain gear plastic forks knives spoons parachute cord personal cleaning wipes a first aid kit and medication good sharp knife and a multitool fishing line small fishing hooks compass cash physical gold and silver map of areas you may need and any other items that would make sense for you special items required by the elderly babies and pets need to be considered as well important paperwork you should bring with you includes birth certificates insurance policies passports medical records pet medical records bank account information deeds and titles to cars homes etc computer backup gather these and put them in a suitable container and wrap in plastic against the elements having such preparations after a tornado hurricane or any calamity would allow you to grab and go because it’s already prepared each member of my family has such a bag i keep each one of them in the basement of our house in a heavyduty large trash bag for protection against the elements  understand what “just in time inventory” is — and how this can affect you most americans take for granted the intricate systems that make it possible for us to engage in seemingly mundane daytoday tasks like filling up our gas tanks loading up our shopping carts at the local grocery store obtaining necessary medications and even pouring ourselves a clean glass of water when we wake up each morning we just expect that all of these things will work today the same way they worked yesterday what very few people have considered is the complexity involved in the underlying infrastructure that allows goods services and commerce in america to flow fewer still have ever spent the time to contemplate the fragility of these systems or the consequences on food water health care the financial system and the economy if they are interrupted the truth is our just in time inventory and delivery systems leave us incredibly vulnerable to a nationwide disaster you see it is very expensive to hold and store inventory so most manufacturers and retailers rely on a continual flow of deliveries that are scheduled to arrive just in time which significantly reduces their operating expenses this is considered to be good business practice for manufacturers and retailers but it also means that if there was a major nationwide transportation disruption our economic system would grind to a halt almost immediately once store shelves are picked clean they would not be able to be replenished until trucks could get back on the road in the event of a major nationwide disaster that could be quite awhile a report prepared for legislators and business leaders by the american trucking associations highlights just how critical our just in time inventory and delivery systems are and assesses the impact on the general population in the event of an emergency or incident of national significance that disrupts the truck transportation systems responsible for carrying some ten billion tons of commodities and supplies across the united states each year a shutdown of truck operations as a result of elevated threat levels terrorist attacks or pandemics would according to the report have a swift and devastating impact on the food health care transportation waste removal retail manufacturing and financial sectors so too would events such as an emp attack or a coordinated cyberattack that could shut down global positioning systems and the computers responsible for inventory control another potential scenario that is more likely now than ever before is liquidity problems within the financial system stemming from currency crisis or hyperinflation all of our just in time delivery systems are built upon the unhindered transfer of money and credit but when credit flow becomes restricted or money becomes worthless no one will be able to pay for their goods likewise no one will trust the credit worthiness of anyone else this is exactly the scenario playing out in greece right now and the consequences on the health care industry in that country have left many without life saving drugs when there’s no money no one will be transporting anything the effects of a transportation shutdown for any reason would be immediate in some cases within hours and absolutely catastrophic while an event that disrupts truck transportation systems may seem unlikely to many recent history suggests it is fully plausible — and the blowback can be devastating a day after hurricane katrina ravaged new orleans panicked government officials stopped all transportation flow into the region forcing hundreds of trucks loaded with emergency supplies like food and water to wait for permission before they could enter the area as a result thousands of residents of the city were left without items essential for survival it took days before truck routes were reopened and supplies were allowed to flow government officials acting on limited information lack of knowledge and personal politics were responsible for restricting the flow of goods into new orleans potentially killing hundreds of people in the process what this incident demonstrated is that when the trucks in america stop all commerce and delivery stops with it  educate yourself on and take measures to store food there is plenty of material available on the internet about the best ways to store food i personally have read many books on the topic and one of the most important features is trying to gather materials that have a long shelf life and which keep their nutritional value most storebought items have very short shelf lives and don’t work well for longterm food storage canned goods can work but these must be stored in a cool dry environment well below room temperature for increased shelf life but not freezing costco and sams club are best for these types of purchases freezedried food can also work but can be rather expensive — and the taste can sometimes be questionable there are many different manufacturers and you need to educate yourself before purchasing i like tasting the items first before making any major purchases better yet is to store staples such as wheat rice beans sugar oats etc — which if stored properly can last up to  years i look at my food storage as an investment and i want it to have a long life there are various methods of storing these staples and each person should consider what method would work best for their circumstances in my own search for getting food storage together i have come across some great resources that may be able to help you as well one company that has many of the products i ended up buying is grandmas country foods located in salt lake city they have a wide assortment of items related to preparedness and their pricing is excellent the product they are most famous for is their powdered milk i have tried at least a dozen different powdered milk products and this is the only one my kids and i can actually drink they also have pound containers of white or red winter wheat which is ideal for longterm storage you then of course have to have a way of grinding this wheat to make flour but you get the idea some other items that i have tried from grandmas country foods that i really like are their canned real butter long shelf life and dehydrated foods which taste better than others ive bought another good source for good tasting freezedried foods is mountain house an internet search will give you multiple sources for obtaining mountain house products  obtain water and purify it in my search for safe drinking water i found what i consider the best available situation on the planet the lifesaver water bottle uses the latest technology to provide clean pure drinking water i have spent a lot of time searching the best way to purifying water and in my opinion theres nothing better  also under the water category it is wise to consider some form of water storage — whether its fivegallon containers gallon plastic drums or some other form of storage all of which can be obtained from many different sources the bottom line in water preparedness is to always have a safe sources of clean drinking water and a way to store it to most this may sound absurd since you can get clean drinking water from the tap in your home but in times of emergency andor civil unrest the water may be shut off — or you may be displaced from your home and will need a way to access clean water this leads to the discussion of having a stockedup safe haven place with two sources of water that is far away from a major city in case of a shtf event this is one of the most rehashed subjects of survival but probably the most important one most people just assume the taps will continue to flow and water will be there people need to know that unless water is from a spring it will likely need to be purified — and this means some reliable filters or boiling which requires heat from a fire along with pots to boil it in aside from drinking water is also needed to rehydrate food make milk from powder and of course for personal hygiene how much water will be needed and used is something that is often vastly underestimated  know how to protect yourself this almost certainly means owning a firearm and knowing how to use it to protect yourself or others many tv survival documentaries show people who feel they can defend themselves with knives or clubs but in reality they are going to lose  of the time against someone else with a firearm someone that has been specifically trained on how to use firearms in a defensive manner will almost always win the day in a gun battle you can’t just own a gun you have to know how to use it at a very high level you also need to know how to clean your weapons and take care of them access to a gunsmith may or may not be available to you during an emergency situation some people think they cannot use a firearm against another person but this feeling changes abruptly when they see one of their family members at risk some people still cannot use a firearm in any circumstance and these people should consider some form of selfdefense such as the nonlethal devices stun batons pepper sprays tasers even baseball bats people can feel that everyone will come together and rebuild society and many good people will — but there are plenty of bad people in this world and it may come down to you or them everyone needs to practice over and over with any selfdefense armament they have so there is no hesitation when it comes to saving one’s life from someone that is willing to take yours or your loved ones for a handgun i recommend a caliber for men and a mm for women most women find the kick of a caliber handgun too much to handle when shooting and are more comfortable with a  mm colt smith and wesson hk sig sauer are some of the best name brands in handguns to consider if you don’t already own a handgun and need to purchase one a caliber handgun has more stopping power than a  mm but any wellplaced shot with any type of gun can mean game over for an intruder or attacker with malintent some other types of guns to consider are a good defensive shotgun  gauge with largesize buckshot and a longrange rifle with a quality scope if you are not familiar with guns it is best to find a friend who is who can help you through the process of buying handguns shotguns or rifles once you have the guns you want it then becomes necessary to know how to safely use those guns without hesitation if needed if you are not familiar with the handling of guns i highly recommend you find someone that can properly train you in a safe environment i have sent my entire family to what i consider the best gun training that exists on planet earth for civilians the name of the place is called front sight and is located an hour outside of las vegas nevada more on them at wwwfrontsightcom if that is too far to travel there are plenty of other training facilities around the country you can find with a local search on the internet for those who live in canada from what i understand it is illegal to own handguns in canada — but not hunting rifles i recommend getting familiar with the process of obtaining any kind of weapons the canadian government will allow citizens to own for hunting purposes or selfdefense unfortunately the bad guys always have illegal guns — even in canada so it is in your best interest to go through whatever permitting or paperwork hassles necessary to obtain legal weapons of any kind in your own country  have a way to cook food in case the power is off a story below from someone who experienced an earthquake serves as a great reminder why we want to have the ability to cook our own food during a crisis a few years ago i remember people waiting in long food lines after the san fernando earthquake hit california many of the people in the damage zone spent hours in breakfast lines then long lines for lunch then a repeat for dinner they had to spend many hours a day in food lines because either they had no food reserves or had no means of cooking their stored food a little preparation can go a long way in preparing for emergencies had these good people stored a little food fuel and invested in a good quality dutch oven they would be set for cooking in their backyard instead of relying on federal troops to supply their familys nutrition good quality dutch ovens are fun to use the food always tastes great and theyre invaluable in emergencies they require charcoal to prepare your food another option is a volcano cook stove which also uses charcoal — but saves twothirds of the amount normally needed when cooking with dutch ovens charcoal is safe and easy to store eliminating the need to store dangerous liquid fuels for emergency cooking most good dutch oven cooks choose kingsford brand charcoal because of the consistency of the product if it takes  briquettes to cook a chicken once it will likely take  the next time  understand the psychology of desperate people this is a difficult one after a shtf sht hits the fan event people will not behave normally that neighbor who was in control during many minor emergencies may be the one pounding on your door with whackedout eyes demanding what you have because they did not prepare for anything someone in your own survival group may just blank out in a zombielike stare unexpected times bring out the best and worst in people — and you need to prepare for this possibility you yourself could lose it again preparing for this will help should it occur you always hope that disasters will bring out the best in your fellow human beings but often this is not the case  maintain proper hygiene this is one of the top priorities within the armed forces because disease and sickness can and do take down the toughest of soldiers people must realize that after a terrible disaster it is not like someone going camping comes back dirty and taking a nice long shower or a hot bath after a shtf event the water to the faucets as well the hot water heater may not work bathing on at least a semiregular basis is necessary to avoid all sorts of bacteria from building up on the skin and causing a variety of concerning ailments that will then have to be treated people should plan on how they will keep themselves clean — think sponge baths or using personal wipes as an option  how to dispose of waste and proper sanitation in third world countries and the preflush toilet era one of the leading causes of illness and death was and still is improperly discarded waste if the toilets won’t flush because there is no water to make them work human waste is going to be a huge whopping problem for people trying to survive even improperly burying human excrement can lead to disease portable toilets toilet paper and disinfectant bleach for one should be one of the top items in any survival kit disposal of other trash is an issue that can bring hungry dangerous animals around drawn to the stench burning of trash is one method plastic trash bags and the means to find some place to dump them is another alternative  learn to control pests and other vermin this is a problem that led to about half of europe dying several hundred years ago with the black death fleas and ticks carry some terrible diseases even people that stay inside their own homes will have to deal with this problem people outside will have to contend with the fleas ticks flies mosquitoes mice rats and so on there are many repellents in nature that can help citronella even the smell of garlic will repel most vermin stocking up on insect and other commercial repellents is always an excellent idea it only takes one bite to make a person deathly sick  understand radiation fallout and how to protect yourself this is one of the least understood of the survival precautions taken there are hundreds of nuclear power plants that could fail after the world as we know it goes down the tube there are still tens of thousands of nuclear weapons available for war should countries decide to use them fallout is something that you might not even see and until you are sick you might not even know you have been contaminated the purchase of a radiation detector that is protected against emp is a wise idea understanding about radiation accumulation dosage rad and how to shield oneself from exposure is paramount  learn first aid treating yourself andor others will probably be the only thing someone can do as medical professionals are going to be few and far between many places offer free classes on first aid because they want people in the community to be prepared a good first aid book along with a first aid kit is something every household should have before during and after a disaster primitive conditions should be expected when anyone is helping someone after a catastrophe a stockpile of antibiotics is always a good idea even acquiring the skill of making your own antibiotics can save lives as infection is something that will become an epidemic especially with minor cuts and abrasions my family has gone as far as being trained to stitch up wounds we decided as a family that we would learn this skill in case anyone we knew was in need we have purchased the sterile suture kits and could stitch small to medium size wounds as good as any doctor at this point we have been trained by medical professionals on a whole assortment of skills — from putting an iv in someone’s arm to treating major trauma this also requires having the right supplies and equipment from my viewpoint this is a skill set that is valuable in any circumstance — but particularly in shtf events when medical personnel may not be available in a convenient time frame  learn about nutrition vitamin and mineral deficiencies are nothing to fool around with just consider what scurvy the lack of vitamin c can do to someone many survivalists and preppers make the critical mistake of only being concerned about calories to keep them going certain vitamins a bb c d e k minerals calcium copper iodine iron magnesium manganese phosphorus potassium selenium zinc and trace minerals are necessary to keep a body going each person needs different amounts and any survival food supply should take this need as important as the food itself many survival foods have some of what your body needs but sadly lack in others vitamin and mineral supplements should be stocked with food if someone is unsure about what they are getting trace mineral drops are a liquid that can solve this problem and are a good addition to any emergency supply  how to start and maintain a fire this is for everyone having a fire and keeping it going when you need it has been the essence of survival for thousands of years fire cooks heats water keeps you warm sterilizes items and gives light having a lighter matches and a starter is one thing but actually keeping the fire going is another making sure the fire does not cause damage to your home or shelter is something not everyone thinks about burning of toxic wood or other material is something to remember as well while most everyone thinks that using a fire is rudimentary there is much more to it as a matter of fact a church group recently tested some of their members and gave them matches to start a file most of the people had trouble starting a basic fire even though they had matches this is a skill that you must acquire that allows you to consistently start a fire anywhere at any time you should also learn to start a fire without matches there are several books listed at the end of this report that can show you how this is done  learn how to grow food andor find it people’s supplies will only last so long and eventually selfsufficiency will mean acquiring your own food — by either growing it or hunting for it many people are into seed storing and in many cases growing your own food will feed the family however growing food has many drawbacks that people need to look at water is an issue in dry areas as irrigation is very man or animalpower intensive one of the gravest things to contemplate is actually guarding your yield as twolegged problems could be a bigger issue to your crops than some beetle infestation hungry people will see food growing and take it  hours a day no one can grow enough food to feed all those seeking food from a practical sense it might be a better idea for some to go the huntergathering route there are many good survival shows on television today that are very informative on surviving off the land learning these skill sets can make a huge difference in any survival situation  lastminute items to secure from a grocery store hopefully you already have your longterm food storage and other preparations in place canned goods grains rice pasta paper products and freezedried foods that store well over time this should allow you to concentrate on these other items while most other people are trying to secure what you already have once a shtf event occurs you may want to quickly go to the grocery store to secure these lastminute items before the shelves are empty these are typically items that don’t store well for the longterm but would be critical to own once a breakdown occurs studies have shown these shortterm storage items go first when a crisis happens most of these products have a shelf life of less than  months bottled water powdered milk pancake mix never use beyond shelf life as this has been known to cause toxic shock ramen noodles popcorn cereal beef jerky cooking oils nuts dried fruits power bars juice powders spices salt pepper etc honey crackers baking essentials flour sugar baking soda baking powder coffee alcohol for medicinal purposes or for bartering hard candies baby food diapers wipes pet food these are just some suggestions that people need to address now — before trying to survive the aftermath of a horrible event people who prepare have to realize that when civilization stops functioning so too does everything that most of us depend on there may never be a safety net there for us when our stockedup survival supplies run dry much of survival is having supplies — as well as backups for when food water and other necessities cannot be found the other part is being ready for everything our new situation could throw our way for this we all need to learn survival skills when someone thinks about their personal needs an individual can probably add many more survival skills to the items we have talked about above you want to become quite proficient in these skills before the shtf so you and your family have a better chance of surviving doomsday prepper shows lately i have been entertained by the recent “doomsday prepper” shows on television that portray the preparations of people who are concerned about various potentially lifethreatening scenarios in most of these cases while many have made some great preparations in some instances they are woefully unprepared in other key circumstances in one case there was a lady who was obviously very prepared with food but wanted nothing to do with other important preparations such as protection here she is on national television telling the world where she is and all about her food preparations she has absolutely no protection and won’t even consider it in my opinion she clearly does not understand how many unwanted people are going to come for her food when a major crisis hits some of those people will probably not even think twice about killing her to obtain it if you have not yet watched any of these shows they can give you some ideas for your own preparations good sources of information or books on these topics strategic relocation by joel skousen swift  learning resources this very

original path and led down the same road that germany followed to nazism patriots surviving the coming collapse by james wesley rawles us army intelligence officer james wesley rawles has written an intensely powerful novel that is more like a survival manual dressed in fiction in his book rawles doesn’t just tell you what could happen he explains exactly how to prepare for it this book is a real pageturner because it is so grounded in what could happen summary i hope this discussion on being prepared has been of some value to you no matter how you feel about the potential for problems in our

seeing in multiple countries in europe right now this is a sign the endgame is near a recent article by a major fund manager from london who previously sold derivatives to europe while working for goldman suks stated his opinion that the endgame for the derivatives is end of this year or early next year no matter how you slice it things worldwide are getting very strange very quickly the time to prepare was yesterday but you still have time to get whatever preparations you can in place while prices remain reasonable and availability exists this can all change quite suddenly however as i

systems administrator talent technology business and economics portal v t e a conglomerate is the combination of two or more corporations engaged in entirely different businesses that fall under one corporate group usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries often a conglomerate is a multiindustry company conglomerates are often large and multinational conglomerates were popular in the s due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bearbull market which allowed the conglomerates to buy companies in leveraged buyouts sometimes at temporarily deflated values famous examples from the s include lingtemcovought itt corporation litton industries textron teledyne because of low interest on the loans the overall return on investment of the conglomerate appeared to grow also the conglomerate had a better ability to borrow in the money market or capital market than the smaller firm at their community bankcitation needed for many years this was enough to make the companys stock price rise as companies were often valued largely on their return on investment the aggressive nature of the conglomerators themselves was enough to make many investors who saw a powerful and seemingly unstoppable force in business buy their stock high stock prices allowed them to raise more loans based on the value of their stock and thereby buy even more companies this led to a chain reaction which allowed them to grow very rapidly however all of this growth was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation conglomerate profits fell investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased whereas the rationale for buying a company was that synergies would provide efficiency by the late s they were shunned by the market and a major selloff of their shares ensued to keep the companies going many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased and by the mids most had been reduced to shells the conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a companys core competency in other cases conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks flush with cash during the s general electric also moved into financing and financial services which in  accounted for about  of the companys net earnings ge formerly owned a minority interest in nbcuniversal which owns the nbc television network and several other cable networks in some ways ge is the opposite of the typical s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage it was often less expensive to lease from ge than buy new equipment using loans united technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate with the spread of mutual funds especially index funds since  investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate another example of a successful conglomerate is warren buffetts berkshire hathaway a

section contains a pro and con list which is sometimes inappropriate please help improve it by integrating both sides into a more neutral presentation or remove this template if you feel that such a list is appropriate for this article march  advantagesedit diversification results in a reduction of investment risk a downturn suffered by one subsidiary for instance can be counterbalanced by stability or even expansion in another division for example if berkshire hathaways construction materials business has a good year the profit might be offset by a bad year in its insurance business this advantage is enhanced by the fact that the business cycle affects industries in different ways financial conglomerates have very different compliance requirements from insurance or reinsurance solo entities or groups there are very important opportunities that can be exploited to increase shareholder value a conglomerate creates an internal capital market if the external one is not developed enough through the internal market different parts of conglomerate allocate capital more effectively a conglomerate can show earnings growth by acquiring companies whose shares are more discounted than its own in fact teledyne ge and berkshire hathaway have delivered high earnings growth for a time disadvantagesedit the extra layers of management increase costs accounting disclosure is less useful information many numbers are disclosed grouped rather than separately for each business the complexity of a conglomerates accounts make them harder for managers investors and regulators to analyze and makes it easier for management to hide things conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks the whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts culture clashes can destroy value inertia prevents development of innovation lack of focus and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment product area or quality price or cachet some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount as evidential of these disadvantages while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency which undervalues the true strength of these stocks media conglomeratesedit further information media conglomerate and concentration of media ownership in her  book no logo naomi klein provides several examples of mergers and acquisitions between media companies designed to create conglomerates for the purposes of creating synergy between them time warner included several tenuously linked businesses during the s and s including internet access content film cable systems and television their diverse portfolio of assets allowed for crosspromotion and economies of scale however the company has sold or spun off many of these businesses – including warner music group warner books aol time warner cable and time inc – since  clear channel communications a public company at one point owned a variety of tv and radio stations and billboard operations together with a large number of concert venues across the us and a diverse portfolio of assets in the uk and other countries around the world the concentration of bargaining power in this one entity allowed it to gain better deals for all of its business units for example the promise of playlisting allegedly sometimes coupled with the threat of blacklisting on its radio stations was used to secure better deals from artists performing in events organized by the entertainment division these policies have been attacked as unfair and even monopolistic but are a clear advantage of the conglomerate strategy on december   clear channel completed the divestiture of live nation and in  the company divested their television stations to other firms some which clear channel holds a small interest in live nation owns the events and concert venues previously owned by clear channel communications quebecor media a canadian company controlling a subset of tv and radio

to opinionated journalism versus traditional journalism opinionated journalism is a journalist adding his or her ideologies on a matter on top of reporting it to the public the coverage that conglomerates have of issues especially political is not necessarily objective and fails to report both sides of an issue if not taking a neutral stance this is known as media bias media bias is ”the intentional or unintentional slanting of news reporting toward one side due political views or cultural beliefs of journalists producers or owners of a media outlet” internet conglomeratesedit
