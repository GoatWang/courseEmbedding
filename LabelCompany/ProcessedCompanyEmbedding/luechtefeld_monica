effective when it comes to ecommerce and improving online businesses the first time i had the pleasure of meeting monica was when we were pitching to supply her organisation with ux services one of the things that stood out the most was how much she already knew about usability the customer experience and website optimisation after working on several successful projects together i realised that it was more than just knowledge and expertise in the subject that made her such an effective leader in my opinion it was very much down to the way she listened so carefully to what everyone had to say whether they were researchers analysts developers or product owners she took everything in and where necessary questioned all aspects in order to fully understand the issues before clearly defining the best course of action she then made sure that all the different teams and stakeholders met their deadlines and delivered the highest quality work throughout the project i would highly recommend

trouble is he has only about  — not quite enough even for a lowend offtherack system but luechtefeld a mother herself can’t bear the thought of sending the kid home emptyhanded so she marches him

of even the store manager is astonished but luechtefeld who is working there as part of a companywide executivesinthefield program isn’t completely satisfied the search wasn’t as seamless as she’d expected there were a few things that could have tripped up less websavvy searchers most disturbing her fellow sales associates seemed only dimly aware of the vast virtual inventory available through the site she vows to make it rightby monday luechtefeld dressed in a stylish black st john’s knit suit is back at her real job as ecommerce chief of office depot annual revenue  billion based in delray beach florida she has a fistful of notes for her tech team “when i came back i told the it guys ‘this is your worst nightmare having me use the tools inside the store’ ” she says laughingpresent at the creation meet one of the fearless mavericks of ecommerce monica luechtefeld has been directing online initiatives for office depot since  when she embarked on a joint project with mit to develop a businesstobusiness web site for ordering office supplies that was the equivalent of the early bronze age of the internet when few people aside from hardcore techies and members of academia had even heard of the web but luechtefeld was excited by the opportunity inspired by the vision of web pioneers like tim bernerslee and determined to position office depot at the forefront of the revolution “although most companies didn’t see it yet i really thought that this kind of technology was going to be a home run for corporate america in automating routine transactions for suppliers” luechtefeld sayseight years later her blend of spirited evangelism and resultsoriented execution has produced an ecommerce grand slam in  office depot’s worldwide ecommerce sales broke the billiondollar threshold topping off at  billion —  of total sales that makes office depot the secondlargest multichannel retailer on the web trailing only amazoncom and puts the officesupply store some 0 million ahead of staples its nearest competitor the company’s recently announced partnership with amazon which will improve its access to individual — as opposed to corporate — shoppers a market that luechtefeld estimates at more than 0 billion means that office depot is likely to reach chairman and ceo bruce nelson’s goal of  billion in online sales this year without breaking a sweatwhat’s even more remarkable than this track record of growth is office depot’s sevenyear track record of profitability the company’s site has made money since its first year of operation there was never starryeyed talk of reckless spending in an attempt to attract eyeballs increase stickiness or monetize traffic “from day one it was all about the sale” luechtefeld says “you had to have initiative and vision but you also had to figure out how to make it work in the real world and make real money”advertisementthe company also decided early on that the web site would not be a standalone venture luechtefeld says but a front door into all of office depot’s other sales channels “we’ve always viewed the web as an enabler to doing business as opposed to a discreet channel” says robert keller president of business servicesthat meant a nosilo strategy at launch the online division was integrated into the company’s backend systems organization chart and business planning webbased transactions were also built into compensation plans for the sales force instantly heading off squabbling over who would get credit for which orders “from an internalaccounting point of view it didn’t matter to us whether the order originated over the phone or online” luechtefeld says “so we weren’t pulling sales from one channel to another we were letting the customer choose” now some 0 of office depot’s corporate customers do their business on the web and ceo nelson predicts that that number will climb to 0 in the next three to four yearsthe long road to internet glory as refreshingly commonsense as luechtefeld’s strategies seem today it wasn’t always so indeed she recalls the rocky transition from the early promise of the mit site to the point where corporate america finally embraced the technology as a lonely slog through a clueless landscape “it took two long years to get our first  customers connected” luechtefeld says during that time she traveled relentlessly in a grassroots effort to sell her vision of how the web would change how business worked it was often an uphill battle “we used to do training at corporations where 0 of the people in the classes had never touched a mouse” she sayskeller recalls one meeting with  fortune  customers that he and luechtefeld had in  he began by asking how many of the customers were buying on the web four people raised their hands then he asked “how many are thinking about doing it” about 0 hands went up finally exasperated he asked “how many people know what we’re talking about here” less than half of the audience weakly waved backwhile those were trying times in the business they were also grueling ones for luechtefeld personally a california native she joined the company in  when office depot acquired eastman the west coast’s leading contract office supplier where she had been vice president for several years she ran the chain’s southern california operations but was persuaded to move to headquarters in  to handle marketing and newbusiness development and to oversee the development of the mit sitereluctant to uproot her son christopher who was a highschool senior luechtefeld let him stay behind with his father for a year and a half she spent her weeks in delray then hopped a flight on friday night to spend her weekends in valencia california “it was an ordeal” she says “but it was worth it”advertisementin  office depot’s planned merger with staples was quashed by the ftc the setback rattled the company which had slowed its expansion pending the completion of the transaction suddenly says michael kirschner a vp in the it businessservices group there was huge pressure to build a public web site — and soon that was in october by january   after more than three months of nonstop work and barely a pause for christmas officedepotcom went live within a few months kirschner says the site had logged its first milliondollar daysoon after keller stripped luechtefeld of all nonwebrelated duties she was furious “i took everything else away” keller admits “she was really honked at me but ecommerce was more than a fulltime job”these days luechtefeld’s hour days leave little time for boredom in addition to shepherding the amazon deal she has launched two specialinterest web sites schoolcom for educational supplies and janitationdepotcom for janitorial cleaning supplies in  she negotiated a deal to acquire surecom an online computernetworking and software reseller adding some  technology products to office depot’s virtual inventory — and giving the company a significant leg up on its competitors in the officesupply space that same year she struck a partnership deal with microsoft to offer bcentral webbased services on the office depot siteluechtefeld is currently working with colleague jerry colley president of north american stores to test potential instore technology services including kiosks and wireless devices and she has ambitious plans to build an online businesswomen’s network and to launch a web site for the hispanic marketplacelooking back luechtefeld credits her parents with planting the seeds that powered her pioneering spirit “my mother always said ‘you can be anything you can do anything’ and my father always told me ‘figure it out’ i think those two scripts really helped me take risks and go where there was no road”asked what message he got from his mother luechtefeld’s son now a broker at morgan stanley in los angeles says “she always told me ‘why not’ “advertisementsidebar what’s fastvirtual sales real experience monica luechtefeld isn’t the only office depot executive to experience firsthand what it feels like to work on the company’s front lines two years ago when bruce nelson took over as ceo store sales were sluggish and employees were still dispirited from the company’s failed merger with staplesto get his executive team in closer touch with the company’s farflung retail empire nelson instituted a program that would send managers — including the ceo himself — to work in the stores one day per quarter the insights from that program are shared in mondaymorning executive meetings and used to make improvements in everything from the company’s web site to its salesforce training the first year that nelson staffed the stores he got an earful of complaints “people told me that this wasn’t the most compelling place to work” he says two years later the reviews are more positive and he spends his tour of duty picking up on ideas for running the stores — and the company — better “people tell me things that are important to them that i never would have thought about” he saysmeanwhile other top executives have discovered their inner sales associate last year during his stint in the field robert keller president of business services helped an elderly customer buy a lamp at the end of the sale she turned around and asked him “how long have you been working in this store” “actually ma’am” he said “this is my first day” “well” she said “you’re getting a pretty late start in life on this but i think you’ve got a career in sales”linda tischler ltischlerfastcompany com is a fast
