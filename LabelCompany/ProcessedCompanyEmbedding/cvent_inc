to state a claim for the reasons stated in open court and in this opinion the defendants motion will be granted in part and denied in part i background this case arises out of the alleged intellectual property theft of data from plaintiff cvents website by eventbrite and an individual by the name of stephan foley using a method known as scraping cvent inc is a delaware software company with its principal place of business in mclean virginia which licenses webhosted software for use by companies and their meeting planners cvent is the owner and operator of a website at wwwcventcom which among other things assists customers in locating venues for and organizing largescale events as part of that business cvent has created a webbased database of meeting venues around the world called the cvent supplier network which includes detailed information about each venue such as the availability and capacity of meeting rooms and venue amenities and services cvent has also undertaken development of a destination guide an informational resource of cityspecific profiles designed for meeting and event planners the complaint alleges that cvent has invested substantial sums of money into developing its website including the cvent supplier network and the destination guide pages and that it has obtained and registered copyrights for its website which are displayed on its website pages cvent currently holds three copyright registrations for its website content that are relevant to this case each of which was filed in late april  defendant eventbrite inc is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in san francisco california which maintains an online event planning sales and registration service hosted on its website wwweventbritecom cvent alleges that in september and october  eventbrite set out to create a set of pages a venue directory on its website containing a collection of publicly available information about hotels restaurants bars and meeting venues in various cities most of the information in eventbrites venue directory is publicly available from the website of each hotel and restaurant cvent alleges that rather than aggregating that information itself eventbrite hired stephan foley a computer engineer to scrape ie copy the information directly from cvents website cvent further alleges that eventbrite then reformatted the material into its own layouts and made it available on the eventbrite website eventbrite compensated foley in november  for his work in scraping the venue information from the cvent website on may   cvent filed a complaint against eventbrite and unknown does  on july   following expedited discovery as to the identifies of does  cvent filed a first amended complaint naming only eventbrite and stephan foley as defendants the first amended complaint sets out eight claims for relief on the following grounds  copyright infringement  usc §  et seq  violation of the computer fraud and abuse act  usc §   violation of the virginia computer crimes act vacode ann §  et seq  lanham act reverse passing off  usc § a   breach of contract based on the terms of use posted on the cvent website  unjust enrichment  business conspiracy vacode ann §  et seq  common law conspiracy cvent seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from accessing its website without authorization and enjoining defendants from copying using or creating derivative works from any cvent website content plaintiff also requests an order impounding and destroying all infringing copies of cvents copyrighted works along with an order directing eventbrite to engage in corrective advertising and also seeks damages interest and attorneys fees in an amount exceeding  the requested damages include compensatory damages lost profits disgorgement of defendants profits statutory damages pursuant to the copyright act treble damages pursuant to the lanham act and vacode ann §  and exemplary damages not in excess of  because of defendants willful and malicious conduct on august   eventbrite filed a motion to dismiss claims two through eight of plaintiffs first amended complaint pursuant to fedrcivp b alleging that those claims are either barred preempted by federal law or otherwise fail to state a cause of action eventbrite further moves to strike events prayers for attorneys fees statutory damages punitive damages and treble damages arguing that those forms of relief are not available pursuant to events first claim for relief copyright infringement in particular eventbrite argues that cvent has not alleged any postregistration copyright infringement in its complaint and that statutory damages and attorneys fees are therefore not appropriate under the copyright act ii standard of review under fedrcivp b a complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears certain that plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would support his claim and would entitle him to relief smith v sydnor  fd   th cir the court must accept all of the complaints wellpleaded allegations as true and view them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff smith  fd at  however that requirement applies only to facts not to legal conclusions ashcroft v iqbal  us   s ct   l ed d   a court need not accept legal conclusions drawn from the facts nor must it accept unwarranted inferences or unreasonable conclusions e shore markets inc v jd assocs ltd pship  fd   th cir in addition if the wellpled facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct the complaint has alleged but it has not shownthat the pleader is entitled to relief iqbal  sct at  factual allegations must be enough to raise a right of relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all of the allegations in the complaint are true bell atl corp v twombly  us    s ct   l ed d   iii discussion the gravamen of cvents complaint is at its core a claim for intellectual property theft and copyright infringement accordingly eventbrite does not move to dismiss plaintiffs copyright act claim claim one nor could it plausibly do so under fedrcivp b however plaintiff  has also raised seven other claims premised upon state and federal law both statutory and common law all of which eventbrite moves to dismiss eventbrite has moved to dismiss plaintiffs virginia computer crimes act claim three lanham act claim four and unjust enrichment claim six claims on the theory that they are all preempted by the federal copyright act eventbrite has also moved to dismiss plaintiffs computer fraud and abuse act claim two breach of contract claim five business conspiracy claim seven and common law claim eight claims on the grounds that for various reasons they each fail to state a legal claim upon which relief can be granted finally eventbrite moves to strike portions of plaintiffs prayer for relief this court will consider each of eventbrites motions in turn a claim two computer fraud and abuse act  usc §  eventbrite moves to dismiss the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa claim on the ground that the cfaa only prohibits hacking or other unauthorized access to files while the material that eventbrite is alleged to have scraped from cvents website is publicly available and eventbrite was thus authorized to access it the cfaa is a civil and criminal antihacking statute designed to prohibit the use of hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access to electronic data by its terms the statute forbids intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access and thereby obtaining  information from any protected computer  usc § a exceeding authorized access is explicitly defined as to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accessor is not entitled to obtain or alter  usc § e eventbrite moves to dismiss this count on the ground that although cvent may have pled facts giving rise to a plausible inference that defendants made an unauthorized use of the material on the cvent website the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a claim that defendants obtained unauthorized access to that information rather the data which eventbrite is alleged to have stripped from cvents website is publicly available on the internet without requiring any login password or other individualized grant of access by definition therefore eventbrite argues it could not have exceeded its authority to access that data cvents only argument in support of its cfaa claim rests upon the terms of use on its website which state in part that no competitors or future competitors are permitted access to our site or information and any such access by third parties is unauthorized  pls opp to defs mot to dismiss first am compl at  notwithstanding that language cvents website in fact takes no affirmative steps to screen competitors from accessing its information cvents csn venue location database is not passwordprotected nor are users of the website required to manifest assent to the terms of use such as by clicking i agree before gaining access to the database rather anyone including competitors in the field of event planning may access and search events venue information at will indeed the terms of use for events website are not displayed on the website in any way in which a reasonable user could be expected to notice them based upon screenshots of the website provided to the court by defense counsel and to which plaintiffs counsel did not object the terms of use do not themselves appear in the body of the first page of the cvent  website the link that accesses the terms is buried at the bottom of the first page in extremely fine print and users must affirmatively scroll down to the bottom of the page to even see the link specifically when users scroll down to the bottom of cvents homepage they are confronted with a black band with twentyeight different links separated into four columns and grouped under four headings event planning online surveys site selection and company info under the company info heading the rightmost heading on the page the terms of use link appears two lines down in small white font sandwiched between privacy policy and contact us moreover even when users click on terms of use they are directed to a secondary page entitled terms of use for cvent products which itself has three separate links to three different terms of use supplier network terms of use event management terms of use and web survey terms of use website users can access the various terms of use documents only by clicking on the appropriate links thereby opening the documents on a new page the documents themselves are each several pages long cvents website including its csn database is therefore not protected in any meaningful fashion by its terms of use or otherwise eventbrite thus properly cites to state analysis inc v american financial services assoc  f supp d  edva brinkema j in which this court rejected a cfaa claim against a defendant who like eventbrite was accused of using material to which it had lawful access in ways that violated the agreement governing that access in state analysis the plaintiff sued two defendants the first was alleged to have accessed the plaintiffs website using usernames and passwords that did not belong to it and to which it had never been given lawful access while the second was alleged to have misused the passwords with which it had been entrusted this court allowed the cfaa claim to proceed against the first defendant but granted the second defendants motion to dismiss explicitlyholding that while use of an unauthorized password to access passwordprotected content may constitute a cfaa violation a mere allegation that a defendant used the information which it had been given lawful authority to access in an inappropriate way did not state a claim for relief id at  the overwhelming weight of authority supports this view of the cfaa see eg lvrc holdings llc v brekka  fd  th cir orbit one commcns inc v numerex corp  f supp d   sdny lewisburke assocs llc v widder no cvjmf  f supp d    wl  at  ddc july   meanwhile the cases cited by cvent in its opposition to eventbrites motion to dismiss nearly all present factual situations that are distinguishable from the facts in the instant case for example america online v lcgm inc  f supp d  edva lee j the only case cited by plaintiff from this district upheld a cfaa claim for electronic datastripping however the defendants in that case were alleged to have obtained aol email accounts in order to use extractor software programs to harvest the email addresses of aol members and then send bulk spam solicitations to them id at  not only was such conduct in violation of aols terras of use but the defendants were plainly never given authorized access to the confidential email addresses of other users the aol case thus stands in contradistinction to this case where the entire world was given unimpeded access to cvents website its csn venue database and its destination guide for those  reasons eventbrites motion to dismiss plaintiffs cfaa claim will be granted b claim three virginia computer crimes act vacode ann §  et seq eventbrite moves to dismiss plaintiffs claim for violation of the virginia computer crimes act vcca arguing that it is preempted by the federal copyright act section a of the copyright act states all legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section  of the copyright act in works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections  and   are governed exclusively by this title  usc § a a state law claim is preempted by the copyright act if  the work at issue is within the scope of the subject matter of copyright as specified in  usca §§   and  the rights granted under state law are equivalent to any exclusive rights within the scope of federal copyright law as set out in  usca §  rosciszewski v arete assocs inc  fd   th cir  a right under state law is equivalent to a right under federal copyright law if that right may be abridged by an act which in and of itself would infringe one of the exclusive rights granted in the copyright act id in support of its motion to dismiss eventbrite relies upon the fourth circuits decision in rosciszewski which held that where a claim under the virginia computer crimes act does not require proof of elements beyond those necessary to prove copyright infringement that claim is preempted by federal copyright law the elements of a violation of the vcca are that the defendant  uses a computer or computer network  without authority and  either obtains property or services by false pretenses embezzles or commits larceny or converts the property of another vacode §  in comparing those elements to the scope of the federal copyright act under  usca §  the fourth circuit in rosciszewski determined that the protection of computer programs from unauthorized copying granted under the vcca is equivalent to the exclusive right of the copyright owner to reproduce a copyrighted work under the copyright act therefore a vcca cause of action is preempted to the extent that it is based on reproduction of the copyrighted computer program id at  in light of the fourth circuits holding the only basis for finding that the vcca claim is not preempted would be if the vcca violations alleged here are distinguishable in some way from the software copying alleged in rosciszewski cvent argues that this case is distinguishable from rosciszewski because the vcca has been amended since the rosciszewski decision the earlier version of the vcca differed from the current version of the statute in one primary respect the earlier version simply required proof that the defendant used a computer or computer network without authority and with the intent to obtain property or services by false pretenses to embezzle or commit larceny or to convert the property of another see id by contrast the statute as amended in  now requires that the defendant must actually commit larceny false pretenses embezzlement or conversion to be liable see vacode ann §  et seq cvent thus attempts to distinguish rosciszewski arguing that the current version of the statute presents a distinct claim for relief that is qualitatively different from a claim for alleged copyright infringement  in its reply however eventbrite properly relies upon state analysis cited on page  of this memorandum opinion in which this court found a vcca claim even under the current amended statute preempted by the copyright act the plaintiff in state analysis similarly argued that its vcca claim was based on elements beyond mere copying including the elements of false pretenses embezzlement andor conversion and that the claim was therefore not preempted by federal copyright law id at  yet the complaint consistently alleged facts relating to the plaintiffs copyright ownership and the defendants alleged infringement accordingly this court found that on the facts as pled by statescape it is difficult to see how any claim under the vcca would contain any elements making it qualitatively different from the copyright act claims and dismissed the claim as preempted id this case is functionally indistinguishable from state analysis cvents first amended complaint alleges facts almost exclusively relating to cvents ownership of copyrights for its website and eventbrites alleged infringement of those copyrights by means of unlawful scraping techniques at no point does the complaint plead specific facts giving rise to a plausible inference of larceny false pretenses embezzlement or conversion as required by the plain text of the vcca in fact cvents claim in this case reduces to nothing more than a copyright infringement allegation dressed up in vcca garb as such the vcca claim is preempted by the copyright act and will be dismissed c claim four lanham act  usc § a eventbrite next moves to dismiss the lanham act claim for reverse passing off on the ground that it is barred by dastar v twentieth century fox film corp  us   s ct   l ed d   in dastar the supreme court held that although the lanham act forbids a reverse passing off of works created by another that rule regarding the misuse of trademarks is trumped by copyright law such that if a copyrighted work passes into the public domain a lanham act claim will no longer lie the dastar court also limited the scope of the lanham act to tangible goods offered for sale and not to the author of any idea concept or communication embodied in those goods id at   s ct  the rationale for doing so was that otherwise a lanham act reverse passing off claim would be functionally indistinguishable from a copyright infringement claim following dastar many courts have rejected claims of reverse passing off based on copying the intellectual property of another and passing it off as ones own for example in smartix international corp v mastercard international llc no cvgbd  wl  sdny sept   the court rejected lanham act claims based on the allegation that the defendant stole confidential and proprietary materials from the plaintiffs computer server similarly in general universal systems inc v lee  fd   th cir the court held that a defendants copying a freight tracking software program and marketing it as its own did not give rise to a lanham act claim see also bob creeden  assocs ltd v infosoft inc  f supp d   ndill larkin group inc v aquatic design consultants inc  f supp d  dkan mcardle v mattel inc  f supp d   edtex however other courts have reached the opposite conclusion allowing lanham act claims to proceed under similar factual circumstances see eg cable v agence france presse no  c   wl  at   ndill july   rejecting dastar challenge in a case involving electronic data stripping experian mktg solutions inc v us data corp no  cv   wl  at  dneb sept   sustaining reverse passing off claim for redistribution of proprietary databases noting that plaintiff did not allege copying the ideas embodied in the databases but rather they alleged improper use of the actual files there is no controlling precedent in the fourth circuit on point nor has this court ever confronted this precise issue however cvent appears to have the better of the argument at least insofar as its complaint does not assert that eventbrite has passed off its ideas as its own but rather that eventbrite has rebranded and repackaged its product the csn venue database and sold it as its own see first am compl ¶  admittedly the supreme courts tangible goods language in the dastar opinion is confusing and tends to suggest that electronic products are not covered by the lanham act however the dastar opinion also makes clear that the court used that language simply to distinguish goods and products offered for sale which receive lanham act protection from any idea concept or communication embodied in those goods which are protected only by copyright laws dastar  us at   s ct  thus to the extent that cvent is pleading its lanham act claim as an alternative to its copyright claim it should be permitted to proceed see j thomas mccarthy mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition §   in many cases a lanham act false designation claim accompanies a copyright infringement claim in the complaint because it is unclear if the copyright is valid is owned by this plaintiff or is infringed the lanham act claim is included as a back up in case the copyright claim fails accordingly cvents motion to dismiss the lanham act claim will be denied d claim five breach of contract eventbrite next moves to dismiss plaintiffs breach of contract claim for failure to state a plausible entitlement to relief eventbrite sets forth three arguments in support of that motion  any contract claim against eventbrite is preempted by federal copyright law  eventbrite is not a party to any contract and  no contract exists the first two arguments are unavailing a breach of contract claim premised upon the terms of use on cvents website is qualitatively different from a claim for copyright infringement under the copyright act and therefore is not preempted moreover as explained below with respect to plaintiffs conspiracy claims cvent has explicitly pled that defendant foley was an agent of defendant eventbrite which hired foley as an independent contractor to perform the alleged website scraping conduct at issue here thus to the extent that any contract exists foleys assent to that contract would bind eventbrite the principal however cvents breach of contract claim fails to state an entitlement to legal relief because cvent has not alleged sufficient facts to support a plausible allegation that a contract existed between cvent and eventbrite plaintiffs complaint fails to allege any written or oral contract between the parties instead cvent relies exclusively on its terms of use which are displayed on secondary pages of its website and can be accessed only through one of several dozen small links at the bottom of the first page as noted above in this courts analysis with respect to plaintiffs computer fraud and abuse act claim on pages  of this memorandum opinion the terms of use link only appears on  cvents website via a link buried at the bottom of the first page moreover users of events website are not required to click on that link nor are they required to read or assent to the terms of use in order to use the website or access any of its content this case is therefore not a clickwrap case but rather falls into a category of alleged contracts that many courts have termed browsewrap agreements see eg hines v overstockcom inc  f supp d   edny  doe v sexsearchcom  f supp d   n  ndohio  neither party in this case has cited case law from either the fourth circuit or this court explicitly addressing the validity of this type of browsewrap contract most courts which have considered the issue however have held that in order to state a plausible claim for relief based upon a browsewrap agreement the website user must have had actual or constructive knowledge of the sites terms and conditions and have manifested assent to them see eg sw airlines co v boardfirst llc no cvb  wl  at  ndtex sept   ticketmaster corp v ticketscom inc no cv  wl  at  cdcal mar   in this case plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to plausibly establish that defendants eventbrite and foley were on actual or constructive notice of the terms and conditions posted on cvents website plaintiff alleges that the terms of the tous terms of use are readily available for review but has not provided any further factual detail to support that allegation pls first am compl at  under the supreme courts recent pleading precedents such conclusory allegations are insufficient to nudge the plaintiffs claims across the line from conceivable to plausible bell atl corp v twombly  us    s ct   l ed d   plaintiff nonetheless advances the additional argument that its complaint states a breach of contract claim under the uniform computer information transactions act ucita as adopted by virginia law ucita provides a breach of contract claim for violation of electronic terms of use if a person  has an opportunity to review the terms and  engages in statements or conduct indicating or leading one to infer the persons assent to the terms vacode §    individuals however are only deemed to have had an opportunity to review a term if the term is available in a manner that ought to call it to the attention of a reasonable person vacode ann §  or if the website discloses the availability of the standard terms in a prominent place on the site and does not take affirmative acts to prevent printing or storage of the standard terms for archival or review purposes vacode §  in its complaint plaintiff makes bare assertions that its terms of use were prominently displayed on its website that defendants had an opportunity to review the terms of use pursuant to vacode ann §  and vacode ann §  and that defendants manifested assent to those terms merely by accessing cvents venue location database however those conclusory allegations are flatly contradicted by the screenshots of cvents website and are plainly insufficient under the iqbal and twombly standard to state a plausible claim for relief the essence of a breach of contract claim is a  meeting of the minds and a manifestation of mutual assent see restatement second of contracts §  cmt c  plaintiff has simply failed to plead  sufficient factual content to allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct with respect to its breach of contract claim ashcroft v iqbal  us   s ct    l ed d   citing twombly  us at   s ct  accordingly count five of plaintiffs first amended complaint will be dismissed e claim six unjust enrichment eventbrite also argues that this court should dismiss plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim on the ground that it is preempted by the copyright act citing microstrategy inc v netsolve inc  f supp d  edva lee j eventbrite contends that state law unjust enrichment claims are preempted to the extent that they are based entirely on an allegation of copying protected works specifically eventbrite alleges that cvents purported claim is based entirely on its allegation that eventbrite copied material from cvents website and sold it as its own as that allegation contains no elements other than bare copying and distribution it is preempted defs mot to dismiss pls first am compl at  eventbrites argument is certainly correct in the mine run of cases see  melville b nimmer  david nimmer nimmer on copyright § bg  a state law cause of action for unjust enrichment is preempted insofar as it applies to copyright subject matter however as noted above with respect to the lanham act claim to the extent that cvent is alleging unjust enrichment based upon eventbrites derivation of commercial benefit from its unauthorized scraping and repackaging of cvents products including the csn database that states a claim for relief that is separate and distinct from a claim for copyright infringement based upon the alleged theft of events copyrightable ideas see pls first am compl ¶  defendants have accepted and retained the benefits of their unauthorized scraping copying and sale of valuable cvent property and products in circumstances which render it inequitable for them to retain those benefits at events expense without payment to cvent emphasis added as this court noted in microstrategy a plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim may survive a preemption challenge if plaintiffs can demonstrate that defendants were unjustly enriched by material beyond copyright protection  fsuppd at  accordingly eventbrites argument is premature at this time and its motion to dismiss plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim will be denied f claims seven and eight business and common law conspiracy eventbrite moves to dismiss plaintiffs statelaw conspiracy claims on the ground that simply put one cannot conspire with oneself cvent alleges a conspiracy between only two actors eventbrite and stephan foley specifically cvent alleges that eventbrite hired and paid foley to scrape data from cvents website for use on eventbrites website courts have repeatedly held that acts of corporate agents are acts of the corporation itself eplus tech inc v aboud  fd   th cir citing bowman v state bank of keysville  va   sed    virginia courts have also specifically adopted the intracorporate immunity doctrine for virginia conspiracy laws see fox v deese  va   sed    as a result it is black letter law that a claim that a corporation has conspired with  its own agent fails as a matter of law to avoid this line of reasoning plaintiff repeatedly argues that foley was merely an outside contractor of eventbrite not an employee and that foley did not take on any fiduciary duties or other obligations of loyalty or obedience toward eventbrite that argument is irrelevant under virginia law because the existence of an agency relationship for intracorporate immunity purposes hinges upon the substance not the form of the relationship between the corporation and the individual see am chiropractic assn inc v trigon healthcare inc  fd   th cir if a corporation delegates a task to an individual including an independent contractor to serve corporate purposes the individual acts with the same general objective as the corporation and the corporation retains ultimate decisionmaking authority then the individual and the corporation are for all intents and purposes the same entity under such circumstances the individual and the corporation logically cannot conspire with one another see oksanen v page memorial hosp  fd   th cir finding that a hospital lacked the legal capacity to conspire with members of an independent peer review committee who were acting on its behalf in this case plaintiff alleges that eventbrite hired foley to mine data from cvents website for eventbrites commercial gain the scraped data was used solely for eventbrites benefit and indeed it is difficult to imagine any independent interest that defendant foley might have had in acquiring it because the allegations in its complaint cannot plausibly allege a business conspiracy or a common law conspiracy between defendants eventbrite and foley eventbrites motion to dismiss both of plaintiffs conspiracy claims will be granted g motion to strike plaintiffs requested relief finally eventbrite argues that certain of cvents prayers for relief including its request for treble damages under the lanham act and vacode ann §  and its request for statutory damages and attorneys fees under the copyright act should be stricken because the lanham act claim will remain in this lawsuit plaintiffs prayer for relief under that statute including treble damages still stands cvent is also seeking both statutory damages and attorneys fees in connection with its copyright act claim eventbrite moves to strike that prayer for relief on the ground that  usc §  bars any award of statutory damages or attorneys fees if the work at issue was not registered at the time the infringement commenced in this case all copyrighted content on the wwwcventcom website including cvents csn venue location database was registered in late april  immediately before plaintiff commenced this litigation however plaintiffs first amended complaint alleges only that the defendant committed unlawful scraping of its website between august  and october  eventbrite therefore correctly argues that on the allegations in the first amended complaint alone plaintiff may only recover compensatory damages not statutory damages or attorneys fees for its copyright claims based on eventbrites alleged preregistration infringement for these reasons eventbrites motion to strike plaintiffs requested relief will be  granted in part and denied in part the motion will be granted in part as to statutory damages or attorneys fees claimed under the copyright act claim count one and any other relief claimed with respect to counts two three five seven and eight defendants motion to strike the remainder of plaintiffs prayer for relief including the prayer for treble damages and attorneys fees under the lanham act count four and equitable relief under the unjust enrichment claim count six will be denied iv conclusion for the reasons stated in open court and in this memorandum opinion eventbrites motion to dismiss will be granted as to counts two three five seven and eight and denied as to counts four and six defendants motion to strike portions of plaintiffs prayer for relief will be granted in part and denied in part as described above notes  defendant foley has not joined in eventbrites motion to dismiss but has been granted an extension of time to file his answer which is now due on september    eventbrite has provided the court with screenshots of the cvent website showing the location of the cventcom terms of use and has requested that the court take judicial notice of those printouts see defs reg for judicial notice  the only exception is when the agent has an independent personal stake in the corporations illegal objectives see eplus  fd at  however plaintiff has not alleged such an independent personal stake on defendant foleys part eventrsvp     respond to an invitation event code go to event forgot your event codeplease contact the planner ofthis eventfor further help or to obtainadditional information
