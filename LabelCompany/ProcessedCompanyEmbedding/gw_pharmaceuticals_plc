political risk increases for medical marijuana  gw pharmaceuticals plc nasdaqgwph  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»political risk increases for medical marijuanajul   about gw pharmaceuticals gwph nick cox longshort equity value growth growth at reasonable pricesummarythe trump administration is likely to increase pressure on all cannabis businessesgw pharma remains the best playother cannabis companies represent poor riskrewardthe policies of the trump administration pose a growing risk to all companies involved in the cannabis sphere attorney general sessions is an implacable foe of all things cannabis and can make life difficult in the legal government approval and finance areas gw pharmaceuticals nasdaqgwph is furthest down the line in terms of approval and product promise it still represents the best play for those willing to accept some risk recreational cannabis remains an extremely high risk area this is both in terms of government policy and in terms of the doubtful corporate governance of the players in the market government policy my article in may gave details at that time since then there have been some fresh developments attorney general sessions wants to get rid of the rohrbacherfarr amendment this is despite the fact that he has always been a leading advocate of states rights the amendment states that federal funds cant be used to countermand laws brought in by individual states  states currently have medical marijuana laws on their statute books in may sessions wrote to members of congress urging them to overturn it i believe it would be unwise for congress to restrict the discretion of the justice department to fund particular prosecutions it is doubtful whether he will succeed in this though members of congress are aware of the popularity of medical marijuana amongst their constituents and many of them share sessions contradictory views on states rights sessions can however continue to ensure that companies involved in the cannabis business do not get the usual corporate tax deductions he can ensure they are not allowed to access banking services he will ensure that cannabis remains a schedule  drug on a par with heroin ridiculously a schedule  drug is one that has no medical use that is selfevidently untrue in the case of medical marijuana sessions talks of the necessity of the war on drugs in fact research has shown that where medical marijuana is available people get weaned off opiod painkillers opioids are the greatest killer drugs in the states at the moment accounting for reportedly  deaths in the usa in  several companies such as nemus bioscience inc nasdaqotcqbnmus are in fact involved in research to use marijuana derivatives to replace opioids as painkillers the recent eaze report also showed that those on antidepressants greatly reduced their dependence on them when they took medical marijuana they also greatly reduced their alcohol intake that of course explains why alcohol companies have been major contributors to anticannabis campaigns sessions may try other measures he might overturn the socalled cole memo in this memo president obamas deputy attorneygeneral james cole held back on federal prosecution of federal law towards the states on cannabis he might also use rico racketeer influenced and corrupt organisations act to prosecute cannabis companies even if they have the goahead from local states he may also try to pressure the dea drug enforcement agency after an nda approval for a specific drug based on a cannabinoid the dea would need to make a final ruling this would normally be a formality it could be made into a problem if the trump administration so willed on a separate negative issue there is the possibility that the trump administration will clamp down on drug pricing in general this was much promised in the election campaign it could well have a negative effect on the price gw pharma could set for instance for its epidiolex treatment for epilepsy however like much else from the campaign it is probably unlikely that this will be followed through in action by the administration on a positive political note a bipartisan group of congressmen announced in june they would reintroduce their carers act this would change the controlled substances act and specify cbd cannabidiol as a separate substance from cannabis it would also open up banking services to medical marijuana companies if that were to happen medical marijuana stocks would undoubtedly rise rapidly however this legislation failed when first introduced in  and is most unlikely to pass congress now even it if did the president would probably refuse to sign it into law the gap between states and the federal government is growing everwider on the issue of cannabis already various states are becoming quite reliant on their taxation of cannabis last year for instance colorado garnered about us million from this source the tax foundation has estimated that a mature cannabis market would bring in tax revenue of approximately us billion states are also developing medical marijuana programs themselves for instance new york state recently approved cannabis tampons for relief of period pain developments elsewhere outside the usa medical marijuana continues to gain approval rapidly the most recent developments include mexico drafting legislation to legalise it already used quite extensively there especially for multiple sclerosis and chronic pain the new legislation is now being finalised the percentage of thc the psychoactive element in cananbis will be restricted the momentum in the americas is gaining rapidly with countries such as canada argentina and uruguay already fully legalised in europe the momentum seems even more unstoppable the latest country to announce it is legalising medical marijuana is poland it will be available through pharmacies by prescription this might seem surprising given poland is perhaps the most catholic and conservative country in europe it shows which way the wind is blowing poland is following similar recent moves by germany the czech republic spain portugal and ireland interesting new research in the uk has shown promising development in the use of cannabinoids for cancer treatment in this case specifically for leukaemia much of the future research for cancer treatment in this way is likely to take place outside of the usa due to restrictions from the us government north american medical marijuana stocks gw pharma remains the furthest down the road towards approvals and with the widest range of testing under process my article in may gave full details of this so i will not repeat all that here some of the many conditions being tested for with various development drugs are childhood epilepsies adult epilepsy autism spectrum disorder gbm brain cancer nhie schizophrenia multiple sclerosis diabetes and cancer pain the range of drugs under process include sativex epidiolex gwp  cpdv gwp gwp and gwp the companys work on gbm brain cancer is seen as particularly exciting long term there are increasing indications of the positive effects of cannabinoids for treatment of many different types of cancer analysts have focused a lot on the possible dollar income to be derived from epidiolex for three different childhood epilepsies this is the drug and the application expecting a final decision from the fda this year it is however just the tip of the iceberg for the potential for epidiolex itself and for gw pharmas range of products it currently has  cannabinoids in preclinical research epidiolex is being tested for a host of other conditions if approved for childhood epilepsies it could also be extended to the much more common adult epilepsies epidiolex itself is expected to be priced at about us for a years treatment there are about  us physicians who currently prescribe antiepileptic drug treatments on a regular basis these will be the target market for the gw pharma sales force that is being set up whether insurance companies will agree to pay for epidiolex is a moot question the current dysfunctional state of the us healthcare system makes such predictions hard to make accurately epidiolex would need to compete against off the shelf natural cbd the status of natural cbd legally in the country is unclear whether insurers would pay for that is also unclear one positive for gw pharma is its focus on orphan designation drugs these allow for  years protection in the usa and  years in europe orphan designation targets specific rare medical conditions not currently targeted by big pharma one reason this status protection is of particular focus by gw pharma is due to the fact that the company is developing products which are based on naturally occurring compounds another positive for the company may be the fact that it originates in the uk that is where it grows its raw materials last year it greatly increased its growing area bearing in mind the questions about cannabis legality in the usa it might be thankful to have its growing facility as pictured below located outside the usa gw pharma may conversely benefit if pure cannabis for medical purposes gets cracked down on harder by the trump administration if its cannabinoid drugs do get approved by the fda it will be the only game in town if pure cannabis is not available to people nemus bioscience is a company i have covered before it is an interesting and professionally managed research company it is the only such company in the usa which has the approval to grow cannabis for research purposes this is in conjunction with the university of mississippi of course that could potentially change under the trump administration one of its lead cbd candidates is aimed at reducing chronic pain it is estimated that  million americans suffer from this condition so the endmarket potential is vast one of its thc candidates is aimed specifically at eye problems latest developments on this were released in a paper given in june glaucoma and macular eye degeneration are being targeted in particular other conditions nemus is targeting overlap with those being targeted by gw pharma nemus is however a long long way from bringing drugs to market and may or may not be able to raise the finances to continue its stock price chart as below tells a familiar medical marijuana story one company which has its backers is insys therapeutics nasdaqinsy a previous article of mine gave some details of this without going into great detail for me this is a company with huge risks for any investor it is embroiled in an ongoing scandal concerning its marketing of its noncannabinoid product subsys this is a fentanyl based opiod painkiller its ceo was arrested and various executives are pleading guilty to defrauding insurers and making illicit payments to doctors to prescribe the product cannabis companies are a high enough risk already without what will be a longpending criminal investigation of the company additionally its most promising cbd product is targeted also at childhood epilepsies if epidiolex gets approved on schedule then insys would very much be second to the party other companies which have their backers and which i have previously written about include zynerba pharmaceuticals nasdaqzyne and vitality biopharma otcqbvbio to me they just dont have a good riskreward profile for numerous reasons zynerba has two promising drug products zyn and zyn they are however far away from commercial realisation and further share dilution is likely if they are ever to come to market with the risk in cannabis companies some might like to play the etf market in april a fund was launched on the toronto stock exchange the horizons medical marijuana life sciences etf hmmj this covers north american medical marijuana companies to me this does not really spread the risk as virtually all companies in the sector are high risk north american recreational marijuana stocks recreational marijuana is a huge growing market in the usa it is likely to remain that way despite the best efforts of the trump administration it is estimated that the legal cannabis market last year was worth us billion arcview market research reckons this will rise to us billion by  of course the illegal market is much bigger recreational cannabis companies to invest in are another story though there have been endless stories of scams and ramping up of small companies with poor finances and no particular market advantage anyway a classic example of this is growlife otcpkphot about which i have written before the year graph below tells the tale this is a typical story a penny stock with no particular advantage for the market gets puffed up on sites such as this the price surges the smart money takes the gains and runs the stock price reverts to the mean conclusion gw pharma has first mover advantage and a host of possible medical treatments from a range of drugs under development this makes it the best bet in the medical marijuana space if one believes that cannabinoids could be beneficial in a wide variety of medical conditions including cancer then the potential is vast long term the legalisation of medical marijuana seems a given short term political obstructions in washington could hurt the company and the whole sector gw pharma is better financed than most of its competitors delays caused by political factors in washington would hurt the whole sector in a business where the rush to approval for drugs is dependent upon financial resources an additional bullish trend for the company is that it is a very possible takeover target many big pharma companies are looking at shrinking drug pipelines its enterprise value of us billion compared to its market cap of us billion means it is quite well valued for such a possible takeover disclosure i amwe are long gwph i wrote this article myself and it

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free

yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you
