mtls materialise nv siemens and materialise technology integration streamlines product design through d printing plano texas  leuven belgiumbusiness wire siemens and materialise have integrated additive manufacturing am technology from materialise into siemens’ nx™ software streamlining the design to manufacturing process for the rapidly growing universe of products being produced using am aka d printing the new solution leverages proven materialise technology to enable nx computeraided design manufacturing and engineering cadcamcae software to accurately and completely prepare cad models for powder bed fusion and material jetting d printing processes as a result the time necessary to go from a completed product design to a fully dprinted part could be reduced by  percent or more a partnership agreement between the two companies announced by materialise on january   enables siemens’ product lifecycle management plm software business to sell the integrated solution through its global sales channels “today’s announcement represents a huge leap forward in making additive manufacturing a mainstream production practice for our customers” said zvi feuer senior vice president of manufacturing engineering software for siemens plm software “until now the additive manufacturing process required manufacturers to work with two separate systems – one for product design and another to prepare that design for d printing the data translation issues and lack of associativity between these two systems created a process that was time consuming and subject to errors by eliminating these issues we are helping to expand the adoption of additive manufacturing as a universally accepted production tool” as one of the world’s most widely used digital product development applications nx is used throughout multiple industries to design some of the world’s most sophisticated products from automobiles aircraft and marine vessels to consumer products medical devices and machinery likewise technology from the materialise magics d print suite enables all commonlyadopted am processes for endpart manufacturing including powder bed fusion as well as material jetting which promises to further accelerate am‘s evolution from a prototyping to a fullscale manufacturing technology the solution being announced today seamlessly and associatively links nx with materialise lattice technology support structures design d nesting build tray preparation and build processors framework technology for additive manufacturing this eliminates data translation conversions and ensures that changes to digital product design models are automatically and associatively reflected in the d print jobs the result is greater model accuracy higher quality and a much faster design to production process “additive manufacturing is a reality now even in highly regulated markets like aerospace and healthcare” says johan pauwels executive vice president at materialise “by bringing together solutions from siemens and materialise we are optimizing and simplifying the workflow for design engineering and manufacturing of components for the past  years our neutral backbone of solutions has pushed the boundaries of additive manufacturing technologies we’re pleased to partner with siemens who truly understands largescale industrial manufacturing environments and shares our belief that designers and engineers can create better products if additive manufacturing is embedded into their mainstream business processes” an initial set of technology is available in the most current version of nx nx  via new modules targeted for additive manufacturing learn more about today’s announcement and how am is impacting the manufacturing industry during the keynote talk by
