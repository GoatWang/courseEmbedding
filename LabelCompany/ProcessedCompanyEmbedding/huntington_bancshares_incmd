and broker nonvotes are counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum but are not counted as votes cast at the meeting broker nonvotes occur when brokers who hold their

cases the brokers as the holders of record are permitted to vote on routine matters which typically include the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm but not on nonroutine matters brokers are no longer permitted to vote on the election of directors or on matters related to executive compensation without instructions from their customers broker nonvotes and abstentions will have no effect on the election of any director or the approval of the other matters described above since they are not counted as votes cast at the meeting but votes affirmatively

developing best practices and regulatory guidance risk assessment of incentive compensation is discussed in greater detail above under the boards role in risk oversight for years we have worked hard to build a culture of doing the right thing for our customers our fair play banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing with products and services that are simple clear and fair we

levels in the organization are subject to this    table of contents policy incentive compensation subject to possible clawback or recoupment includes any cash incentive or equity compensation vested or unvested in general situations that trigger a review under this policy involve behaviors or actions outside the bounds of the companys overall risk appetite and governance structure the

governance section above we provide a balanced total compensation package which includes both fixed and variable performancebased elements the use of both shortterm and longterm incentives ensures that the ultimate compensation delivered is dependent upon achievement of our annual business goals as well as delivering longterm shareholder value our performance and evaluation process considers company business segment and individual performance as well as performance relative to industry peers our target pay levels are designed to be competitive with market practice since a majority of our pay is variable and based on performance our actual pay positioning will vary appropriately to reflect our performance while overall compensation policies generally apply to all executives we recognize the need to differentiate compensation by individual reflecting on his or her role experience performance and expected contributions base salaries and incentive targets are the primary means for differentiating compensation opportunities to reflect executive role and scope of responsibility for example mr steinour has a higher base salary and higher potential award opportunities due to his responsibilities as ceo he is also held to a higher stock ownership guideline reflecting his increased stake in our performance     guiding principles focus on longterm shareholder alignment   a significant portion of compensation is stockbased and longterm in focus approach compensation in a balanced and holistic fashion   our program includes fixed and performancebased elements shortterm

group has a frame of reference for understanding compensation levels and program design before the acquisition of firstmerit and the second peer group was used for the same purposes following the acquisition of firstmerit we reevaluated and updated the peer group in  for ongoing relevance as we do each year the process began with the selection of us based publicly traded commercial banks

provides for certain payments to him upon termination in certain situations other than a change in control in addition each of the named executive officers has outstanding rsu awards and psu awards which may be subject to accelerated vesting upon involuntary termination not for cause death or disability executive agreements under the executive agreements change in control generally includes

of the preferred stock will have limited voting rights holders of the preferred stock will have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting stockholders holders of the preferred stock will have voting rights only as specifically required by the terms of the preferred stock as described below under description of the preferred stockvoting rights holders of depositary shares must act through the depositary to exercise any voting rights of the preferred stock our ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of our subsidiaries we are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through our bank and nonbank subsidiaries as a result our ability to make dividend payments on the preferred stock will depend primarily upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries if we do not receive sufficient cash dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries it is unlikely that we will have sufficient funds to make dividend payments on the preferred stock our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to provide us with funds to make dividend payments on the preferred stock whether by dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any dividend payments distributions loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries in the future will require the generation of future earnings by our subsidiaries and may require regulatory approval there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the bank to us as well as by us to our stockholders the bank may not without prior regulatory approval pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits if the bank is unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient capital is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments on the preferred stock in addition our right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiarys liquidation or otherwise will generally be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary your ability as a holder of the depositary shares representing the preferred stock to benefit indirectly from that distribution also will be subject to these prior claims as a result the preferred stock will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries including deposits you should look only to our assets as the source of payment for the depositary shares representing the preferred stock   s table of contents our ability to pay dividends on the preferred stock and therefore your ability to receive distributions on the depositary shares may be limited by federal regulatory considerations our ability to make dividend payments may also be restricted by federal regulations applicable to us as a bank holding company and to our banking subsidiaries the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act requires federal banking agencies to establish more stringent riskbased capital guidelines and leverage limits applicable to banks and bank holding companies and especially those institutions with consolidated assets equal to or greater than  billion the federal banking agencies have approved final rules implementing the basel committee on banking supervisions regulatory capital guidelines in the united states including the reforms known as basel iii the federal reserves final rule sets forth the proposed criteria for qualifying additional tier  capital instruments consistent with basel iii including the requirement that any dividends on such instruments be paid out of the banking organizations net income retained earnings and surplus if any related to additional tier  capital instruments and introduces a new capital conservation buffer requirement the failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer once effective may result in limitations or restrictions on the ability of huntington and our banking subsidiaries to make capital distributions such as the payment of dividends in addition under its comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar the federal reserve requires large bank holding companies including us to submit annual capital plans and to obtain nonobjection or regulatory approval before making capital distributions such as the payment of dividends the federal reserve may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will maintain minimum capital ratios on a pro forma basis under expected and stressed conditions throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan the federal reserve has also instructed that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding  of aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny federal banking laws also regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by our banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval the above or any future rules regulations or capital distribution constraints could adversely affect the ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends to us our ability to pay dividends on the preferred stock and your ability to receive distributions on the depositary shares an active trading market for the preferred stock and the related depositary shares does not exist and may not develop and the market price and liquidity of the depositary shares may be adversely affected the preferred stock and the related depositary shares are new issues of securities with no established trading market we plan to apply for the listing of the depositary shares representing proportional interests in our preferred stock on the nasdaq however we cannot be certain that the depositary shares will qualify for listing if they do not qualify for listing or if an active trading market does not develop you may have difficulty selling any of the depositary shares representing proportional interests in our preferred stock we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in the depositary shares will lead to the development of an active trading market on the nasdaq any other national securities exchange or otherwise or how liquid that market might become if an active liquid market does not develop for the depositary shares the market price and liquidity of the depositary shares may be adversely affected holders of depositary shares may be unable to use the dividends received deduction distributions paid to corporate us holders of the depositary shares may be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes although we presently have accumulated earnings and profits we may not have sufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits during future taxable years for the distributions on the preferred stock to qualify in whole or in part as dividends for us federal income tax purposes see certain us federal income tax considerations there may also be future changes in tax law that impact the availability of the dividendsreceived deduction if any distributions on the preferred stock with respect to any taxable year are not eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction because of insufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits or otherwise the market value of the depositary shares may decline   s table of contents additional issuances of preferred stock or securities convertible into preferred stock may further dilute existing holders of our preferred stock we may in the future determine that it is advisable or we may encounter circumstances where we determine it is necessary to issue additional shares of preferred stock securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of preferred stock or preferred stockequivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders our board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights dividend rights and preferences over our preferred stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution winding up and liquidation and other terms though the approval of a supermajority of the holders of preferred stock will be needed to issue any equity security ranking above the preferred stock if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the preferred stock the rights of holders of our preferred stock or the market price of our preferred stock could be adversely affected the market price of our preferred stock could decline as a result of sales of preferred stock made after this offering or other offerings as well as other sales of a large block of shares of our preferred stock or similar securities in the market thereafter or the perception that such sales could occur we may need to increase our authorized capital in order to raise such equity capital one rating agency is expected to rate the preferred stock below investment grade because one rating agency is expected to assign the preferred stock a noninvestment grade rating the depositary shares may be subject to a higher risk of price volatility than similar higherrated securities furthermore increases in leverage or deteriorating outlooks for an issuer or volatile markets could lead to continued significant deterioration in market prices of belowinvestment grade rated securities ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or agencies and such ratings could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency further a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold any particular security including the preferred stock and related depositary shares in addition ratings do not reflect market prices or suitability of a security for a particular investor and any rating of preferred stock may not reflect all risks related to huntington and its business or the structure or market value of the preferred stock risks related to the merger regulatory approvals for the acquisition of firstmerit may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisition before our acquisition of firstmerit the firstmerit acquisition may be completed we and firstmerit must obtain approvals from the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency and the united states department of justice other approvals waivers or consents from regulators may also be required an adverse development in either partys regulatory standing or the factors considered by relevant governmental authorities could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay receipt of required approvals the relevant governmental entities may impose conditions limitations obligations or restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business or require branch divestitures or changes to the terms of the firstmerit acquisition there can be no assurance that relevant government entities will not impose conditions limitations obligations or restrictions and that such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of the firstmerit acquisition imposing material additional costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the firstmerit acquisition or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the firstmerit acquisition additionally the completion of the firstmerit acquisition is conditioned on the absence of certain orders injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of the firstmerit acquisition   s table of contents the success of the firstmerit acquisition and integration of huntington and firstmerit will depend on a number of uncertain factors the success of the firstmerit acquisition will depend on a number of factors including without limitation        our ability to integrate the business acquired from firstmerit bank in the firstmerit acquisition the acquired business into the banks current operations        our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired business and to successfully retain and manage interestearning assets ie loans acquired in the firstmerit acquisition        our ability to control the incremental noninterest expense from the acquired business in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio        our ability to retain and attract the key employees and appropriate personnel        our ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and noninterest income including fee income from the acquired business        our ability to retain the customer relationships from the acquired business and        the possibility that divestitures may be required by regulatory authorities in certain markets in which we and firstmerit compete integrating the acquired business will be an operation of substantial size and expense and may be affected by general market and economic conditions or government actions affecting the financial industry generally integration efforts will also likely divert our managements attention and resources no assurance can be given that we will be able to integrate the acquired business successfully and the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the firstmerit acquisition we may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition perhaps materially additionally no assurance can be given that the operation of the acquired business will not adversely affect our existing profitability that we will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business or that we will be able to manage any growth resulting from the firstmerit acquisition effectively combining huntington and firstmerit may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized huntington and firstmerit have operated and until the completion of the firstmerit acquisition will continue to operate independently the success of the firstmerit acquisition including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business and firstmerits business in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of either companys ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined companys ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the firstmerit acquisition the loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business which could have an adverse effect on our financial results if we experience difficulties with the integration process and attendant systems conversion the anticipated benefits of the firstmerit acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected as with any merger of financial institutions there also may be business disruptions that cause us andor firstmerit to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us andor firstmerit and move their business to competing financial institutions integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management   s table of contents attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of firstmerit and us during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the firstmerit acquisition on the combined company in addition the actual cost savings of the firstmerit acquisition could be less than anticipated we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the firstmerit acquisition is pending uncertainty about the effect of the firstmerit acquisition on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the firstmerit acquisition is completed and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us retention of certain employees by us may be challenging while the firstmerit acquisition is pending as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company if key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us our business could be harmed   s table of contents consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges the table below sets forth huntingtons consolidated ratios of earnings to fixed charges for

the irs with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in this discussion and there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with such statements and conclusions the remainder of this discussion assumes that beneficial owners of the depositary shares will be treated as owners of the underlying preferred stock for us federal income tax purposes us holders as used in this discussion the term us holder means a beneficial owner of the depositary shares that is for us federal income tax purposes        an individual citizen or resident of the united states   s table of contents      a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof or the district

respect to the depositary shares will be taxable as dividend income to the extent paid out of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes to the extent that the amount of a distribution with respect to the depositary shares exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits such distribution will be treated first as a taxfree return of capital to the extent of the us holders adjusted tax basis in such depositary shares and thereafter as capital gain distributions with respect to the depositary shares taxable as dividends for us federal income tax purposes paid to a corporate us holder will generally qualify for a  dividendsreceived deduction however a corporate us holder may not be entitled to take the  dividendsreceived deduction in all circumstances and even if it is so entitled may be subject to special rules in respect of its ownership of the depositary shares corporate us holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the holding period and other requirements that must be satisfied in order to qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction and with respect to the possible application of the extraordinary

depositary shares  a us holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss on a sale or exchange or other taxable disposition other than certain redemptions described under us holdersredemptions of the depositary shares of the depositary shares equal to the difference if any between the amount realized upon the sale or exchange and such us holders adjusted tax basis in the depositary shares sold or exchanged such capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holders holding period for the depositary shares sold or exchanged is more than one year longterm capital gains of noncorporate taxpayers are generally taxed at preferential rates the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations redemptions of the depositary shares  the tax treatment accorded to any redemption by us of our depositary shares from a us holder can only be determined on the basis of the particular facts as to each us holder of our depositary shares at the time of redemption in general a us holder of our depositary shares will recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount received by the us holder of such depositary shares upon the redemption and such us holders adjusted tax basis in the depositary shares redeemed if such redemption is considered to        result in a complete termination of the us holders stock interest in us        be substantially disproportionate with respect to the us holder        be not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the us holder or   s table of contents      be a redemption of stock held by a shareholder who is not a corporation and where such redemption results in a partial liquidation of us in applying these tests there must be taken into account not only the depositary shares being redeemed but also such us holders ownership of other classes and series of our capital stock and any options including stock purchase rights to acquire any of the foregoing a us holder of our depositary shares also must take into account any such securities including options which are considered to be owned by such us holder by reason of the constructive ownership rules set forth in section  of the code if the redemption does not meet any of the tests described above then the redemption proceeds received from our depositary shares will be treated as a distribution on our shares and will be taxable as described under the caption us holdersdistributions above if a redemption of the depositary shares is treated as a distribution that is taxable as a dividend us holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the allocation of their tax basis in the redeemed and remaining depositary shares information reporting and backup withholding  information returns will generally be filed with the irs in connection with the payment of dividends or other taxable distributions on the depositary shares to noncorporate us holders and certain payments of proceeds to us holders on the sale exchange or redemption of the depositary shares additionally such payments may be subject to backup withholding currently at a rate of  unless such us holder a comes within

the option the underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing depositary shares in the open market a naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the depositary shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering as an additional means of facilitating the offering the underwriters may bid for and purchase depositary shares in the open market to stabilize the price of the depositary shares these activities may raise or maintain

underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased depositary shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions in
