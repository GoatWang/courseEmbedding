uncertainties and assumptions if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect the company’s actual results may vary materially from those

included as part of a federal consolidated tax return filing group with its parent company under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities of the company are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are

tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized the determination of the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the financial statements only after determining a morelikelythannot probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities then the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement when facts and circumstances change the company
