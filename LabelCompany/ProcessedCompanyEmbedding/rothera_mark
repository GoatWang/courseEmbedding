email print mark rothera chief commercial officer ptc therapeutics david vaczek speaks with ptcs mark rothera about the global launch of its lead product and how the biotech is gearing up to commercialize duchenne drug translarna in the us the following is edited from a longer discussion and is part of an occasional series of interviews with biotech marketers dv translarna ataluren is in phase iii in this country but is currently launching overseas with the drug now available to some patients in europe what are the next steps for commercialization mr the launch in germany is an important step because not only is it the first time we are launching translarna around the world but also the firstever drug to be specifically launched for duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd we are pursuing two parallel tracks the gating event for commercialization is the pricing and reimbursement negotiations with the eu states which can take anywhere from three to  months going into  we are pursuing access to the drug in sweden denmark and norway and in the second half of q the uk followed by france italy and spain we feel equally passionate about early access programs where countries allow reimbursed drug before formal commercial launch for rare diseases for which there are no therapeutic alternatives boys with this severe musclewasting disease have a life expectancy in the s so every day counts we are already providing reimbursed drug into france spain and italy and now turkey and israel dv how is translarna being marketed to hcps and patient groups rothera to have a first drug that has made it over the line with regulatory approval is a huge moment for the dmd community and has given them a lot of hope for the future one of the challenges is helping them to understand the realities of the marketaccess process we are focusing on patient genotyping to make sure the right patientsthe  of dmd patients with a nonsense mutationare accurately identified as right for the drug as no therapy has been available not all patients have been genotyped patient groups are playing an active role here they are helping with compliance education an important aspect for a new oral therapy taken three times a day by children of school age we are putting on master classes at support centers where physicians can hear from experts on best practices and what holistic management of the patients is like the number of centers of excellence can be quite limited for rare diseases and you find physician competence varies you can help improve standards along with the community dv what will translarna cost mr ultra orphan therapies are typically priced in the  to  a year range this type of therapy is  reimbursed in the eu through agreements reached at the country level based on price and how many patients will benefit dv  what is the efficacy bar for the act dmd confirmatory phaseiii trial for supporting full eu approval and the yearend nda rolling submission filing for translarna with fda mr we learned in our phaseb study which patients we will need to select for the confirmatory trial to be able to show the effect of the drug most clearly in a week period we showed an average meter difference in walking ability in phase b between active and placebo arms we expect to show at least that because of the improved selection the trial will read out this year in the third quarter when we would expect to then use it as the basis for completing our submission to fda dv prosensa and sarepta target a different kind of dmd genetic mutation how will they impact the landscape should they come to market mr there is no overlap between their drugs and ours as they treat different subpopulations with dmd all the drugs have benefitted from learning on the progression of the disease with these mutations dv  ptc is pursuing indications for cystic fibrosis and mps how big is translarnas potential mr translarna is a kind of proof of principle for treating diseases caused by a nonsense mutation which is present in up to  monogenic diseases with about  occurance on average so dmd could be just the beginning in changing the courses of these diseases its been a year journey to this point we have had to pioneer getting a firstinclass drug with a novel mechanism of action to market we were the first to pioneer a clinical development end point for regulatory purposes and the first to go through the regulatory process to a conclusion along the way we have had to learn and share that learning with a lot of people and communities share this content facebook
