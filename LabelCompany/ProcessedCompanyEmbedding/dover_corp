rings rotary lift automotive lifts c norris oilwell pumpsucker rods and peerless space heaters dover corporation was incorporated in  and in  ohrstrom brought in the former owner and president of c lee cook company fred d durham to manage his four companies later that same year the dover corporate offices opened in washington dc and dover corporation went public on the new york stock exchange as such the year  marks the companys official foundingoriginal research fred durham influenced dovers corporate culture emphasizing autonomy decentralization and few corporate staff members as a result divisions were run in an independent fashion each with its own president today dover is still known for its decentralized management structure in its governance of operating companies and for its acquisitive approach between  and  dover acquired fourteen companies a great deal of this acquisition activity served to build the dover elevator business this elevator growth began in  as dover elevator split from rotary lift and became an independent operating company within dover dovers purchase of the shepard warner elevator company in  marked the beginning of an effort to grow the elevator business in  dover acquired acme elevator and then elevator service reddy elevator company in  and hunterhayes elevator company in  with these purchases dover soon became the third largest elevator company in the us and remained so for many years dover continued to expand its elevator division throughout the s and s with the purchases of moody  rowe burch turnbull burlington hammond  champness louisiana elevator and ww moore ultimately dover sold its elevator business in  to thyssen ag for  billion dover elevator had a pretax operating profit of  million in  and the sale was mutually beneficial it allowed dover to focus on building its other businesses and moved thyssenkrupp elevator americas to the number three spot worldwide in the elevator and escalator industryclarification needed acquisitionsedit dovers acquisition history reaches beyond the elevator industry with a focus on diversification in the s such as the acquisition of ohio pattern works  foundry company in  came notable purchases of companies that continue to be a significant part of dover corporation today the company was shorthanded to opw and in  one of its engineers leonard h duerr invented the automatic shutoff fueldispensing nozzle valve today the basic technology of duerrs invention continues to exist in automatic shutoff nozzles and opw is still a part of dover specializing in the design and manufacture of commercial and retailfueling solutions in  dover made two notable acquisitions detroit stamping company now destaco specializing in the design and manufacture of clamping gripping transferring and robotic tooling solutions and alberta oil tool now part of dover artificial lift today alberta oil tool produces specialty drive rods norris tubular fittings norriseal control values and other products  marked a significant year as opws former leader thomas sutton became president of dover and corporate headquarters were relocated to new york city the s were characterized by dovers intent to expand beyond its principle industries of building materials equipment and industrial components a result of this effort included the acquisition of dieterich standard which manufactured liquidmeasurement instruments and whose president gary roubos went on to become dovers chief operating officer coo and president in  later roubos became dovers chief executive officer ceo in  another significant acquisition included sargent industries a manufacturer of control devices for aerospace and industrial endmarkets purchased in  for  million the sargent aerospace  defense unit persisted as a global supplier of precisionengineered components and aftermarket services performing critical functions on a variety of commercial and military aircraft submarines and landbased vehicles in the s dover also began to focus more on electronics this period was marked by the acquisitions of kl microwave in  dielectric laboratories in  and nurad in  dover later chose to spin off dovatron in  to shareholders as the company specialized in circuitboard assembly and had become a source of competition for dover customers that same year dover acquired phoenix refrigeration systems which then acquired hill refrigeration in  to form hillphoenix hillphoenix now manufactures commercial refrigeration systems and mechanical centers electrical distribution products walkin coolers and freezers and specialty display cases and fixtures the company is a partner of the epas greenchill initiative which focuses on reducing refrigerant emissions and climatechange impact hillphoenix has more equipment installed at greenchill certified retail stores than any other refrigeration manufacturer also in  dovers coo and president thomas reece became ceo of the company the following year dover purchased an  percent interest in the french company imaje printing products for  million this acquisition marks the largest in dovers corporate history in  dover acquired markem corporation which specializes in identification solutions one year later the companies merged and were renamed markemimaje and have since focused on product coding labeling and traceability solutions sedit while dover acquired more than seventy companies between  and  the companys acquisition rate slowed in the early s dover sold eight companies in  for a total of  million the early s also marked a leadership change ronald hoffman dovers vice president and former president and ceo of dover resources become president and coo of dover corporation in  in  he was appointed to the position of ceo the financial crisisclarification needed hitclarification needed dover hard but the companyclarification needed recovered quicklyclarification needed dover focused on growing target areas from  to  including electronic communication energy and fluids product identification and refrigeration dover continued to grow its refrigeration business with the  purchase of anthony international for  million anthony designs and manufactures specialty glass commercialglass refrigeration and freezer doors lighting systems and display equipment in  robert livingston was appointed dovers new ceo and president livingstons dover career began twentynine years earlier with the acquisition of kl microwave where he was a vice president after joining dover livingston also served as coo and vice president of dover corporation president and ceo of dover engineered systems and president and ceo of dover electronics under livingstons leadership dover moved its corporate headquarters from new york city to the chicago area in  factors at play in this decision included chicagos central location wide variety of housing options for employees quality of life and nearby air service to national and global destinations the choice to move to downers grove illinois was also partially impacted by an effort to consolidate operations and reduce administration costs as the move brought all four segment headquarters under one roof from  to  dover acquired almost twentyfive companies livingstons corporate development strategy sought to strengthen promising businesses and divest those that were either growing slowly or had significant exposure to highly volatile industries as a result dover was able to apply greater focus to growing four or five targeted endmarkets livingston also worked to reduced expenses by consolidating back office operations metal purchases and freight transportation inproseal a producer of bearing isolators was purchased by waukesha bearings corporation in  which included  shares of dovers common stock being issued to inproseal shareholders in  kmc inc and bearings plus inc were acquired by waukesha bearings corporation with the expectation of synergizing their bearing seal technologies with dover in addition between  and  dover spent approximately  million to purchase a total of sixteen businesses while only  million was earned from the sale of eight businesses in  dover expanded its acoustic components business with the purchase of sound solutions a manufacturer of dynamic speakers and receivers for mobile phones and other consumer electronics for  million dover had acquired knowles a designer and manufacturer of hearingaid technology and other acoustical componentry six years earlier for  million together sound solutions and knowles gave dover the necessary scale to develop integrated solutions for the rapidly evolving mobileelectronics industry in  dover spun off knowles which had a  billion market cap postspin today knowles continues to be a global supplier of communicationtechnology components such as mems microelectromechanical systems microphones speakers receivers transducers capacitors and oscillators dover ceo and president robert livingston described the spinoff as allowing both knowles and dover to more aggressively pursue their individual growth strategies segments and operating companiesedit dovers

development  dover corporation corporate development home about us corporate development our acquisition strategy is focused on driving growth by investing capital in four strategic growth segments energy engineered systems fluids and refrigeration  food equipment for more than  years we have acquired promising manufacturing companies fueling mutually beneficial growth and opportunities by leveraging our scale and resources “our progressive focus fuels both organic growth and successful acquisitions harnessing our scale to apply precise expertise to every industry we serve” — bob livingston president and ceo our approach philosophy our leadership history has shaped our operating style we trace our roots back to a group of s investors led by george ohrstrom sr ohrstrom targeted financially successful family or closelyheld businesses whose owners not only wished to monetize their assets but also hoped to provide a secure future for their employees and remain personally involved with their companies this handson strategydriven acquisition model is still fundamental to our business today ohrstrom preferred modestly sized profitable enterprises run by firstclass people who understood their businesses and customers and could continue to be successful this is the mindset at dover today in the century since ohrstroms ambitious beginnings our six ceos have diligently worked to develop dover into a company of tomorrow without forgetting the strategy and integrity of our past strategy we are focused on building businesses around larger global segments while looking for opportunities to work closely with customers and leverage expertise across dover we support the growth plans of our existing businesses and utilize our strong excess cash flow to make acquisitions that are the right fit strategically and culturally for our continued innovation and growth what are the benefits access financial strength accelerate market penetration and global growth attract worldclass talent share in best practices leverage tools and resources eg lean and productivity supply chain efficiencies back office support “now being part of hillphoenix we have been able to follow the requests of our international retailers so when they ask us ‘are you ready to set up a support business in china’ we can say ‘yes we are ready when you are ready’’ — torben hansen former commercial product director advansor what we look for leading brands and technology we acquire manufacturers of highly engineered valueadded industrial components or systems we look for customerinspired market leaders whose premier brands proprietary technology and intellectual property make them indispensable partners to their industrial and commercial customers attractive markets we prefer companies that are wellpositioned in global growth markets and noncyclical industries that benefit from macro growth trends we also seek businesses with attractive aftermarket and recurring revenue and service opportunities strong financials we proactively search for companies with strong financial performance that can be built upon for significant future growth we seek companies with the ability to achieve operating profit margins above  addon business or product lines can be any size if they expand one of our key strategic segments or operating companies and will become part of an existing dover operating company standalone acquisitions generally have revenue of  million or more and will become independent operating companies as part of a segment strong management we are also committed to buying businesses that have strong management teams our culture requires the operating management team to demonstrate ownership in product development and innovation continuing to operate close to the customer we carefully assess the skill energy ethics and compatibility of the top executives of each acquisition candidate before determining if a business will integrate well into our driven growthoriented organization watch ueli thuerig president of psg emea describe how maag and dover shared a mutual interest in growth opportunities shared perspective we seek companies that can grow and prosper from our expertise scale tools and resources such as global sourcing regional infrastructure and talent development in addition it is important that prospective acquisitions share our drive our entrepreneurial mindset and our deep commitment to integrity  you want to grow with us we seek acquisition candidates that would be a strategic addition to one of our growth segments and fill existing adjacencies whether they are in technology white spaces product lines changes of ownership or global geographic expansion  you are entrepreneurial we attract businesses that are run by entrepreneurial talent who take an ownership mindset and are driven to grow businesses for the future we like working with ambitious teams who stay close to the customer whether an addon or an independent standalone operating company all acquisitions must share our commitment to truly understanding customer needs and constantly innovating for the customer  you share our values across segments opcos and industries our leaders are linked by a deepseated integrity with guidance from segment leaders dovers company presidents set the direction for their own companies make their own decisions and nurture and grow their own organizations they run their businesses independently with the expectation of excellence and integrity our values are reflected in all that we do together we will make the most of strategic opportunities synergies and resources to realize success and expand our growth segments together we will redefine what is possible in energy fluids refrigeration  food equipment and engineered systems watch jeff clark former senior vp of hillphoenix describe how leveraging combined synergies helped anthony grow what to expect we take a buyholddevelop approach rather
