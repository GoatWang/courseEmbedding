relationship portfolio management investment principles investment process blog resources contact us you are herehomeabout usour principles our principles investing decisions must be made in the context of a comprehensive personalized plan geared to meet specific quantifiable objectives in serving your financial needs we adhere to five core principles written plan financial and investment plans need to be in writing so that the document becomes the primary instrument guiding all decisions longterm focus shortterm market and economic moves are unknowable while longterm market appreciation is inevitable successful investors take advantage of this longterm trend to achieve their goals emotional discipline the key risk most investors face is that they might succumb to their emotions selling in a panic or buying in euphoria maintaining a disciplined approach protects you from making decisions based on emotions low costs the goal is for you not the investment company to capture the investment returns in your best interest your financial advisors incentives must work in alignment with your own objectives and our assetbased fees avoid potential conflicts   ask a
