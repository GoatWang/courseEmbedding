diabetic nephropathy addressing an unmet medical need to slow disease progression at nephrogenex we are committed to developing a more effective treatment for diabetic kidney disease—a critical global health issue we are now in a phase  study with pyridorin® pyridoxamine dihydrochloride a novel acting compound to reduce the rate of disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy dn due to type  diabetes currently available treatments for diabetic nephropathy are effective but a significant residual risk remains despite the availability of two classes of approved treatments for diabetic nephropathy angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs diabetic nephropathy remains the most common cause of end stage renal disease there is a significant unmet medical need for new treatments that can slow or stabilize the progression of diabetic nephropathy therapy targets an underlying cause of the disease to improve outcomes unlike any currently approved therapies pyridorin slows down the formation of advanced glycation end products ages that have been implicated in the development of diabetic nephropathy                     a variety of completed preclinical studies in animal models of diabetes demonstrate that treatment with pyridorin improves kidney histology and slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy phase  data from over  subjects has enabled us to identify the type of patients that may demonstrate benefit from pyridorin in a phase  trial—type  diabetic patients with advanced kidney disease serum creatinine mgdl and mgdl who have a significant amount of protein in their urine pcr mgg based on safety efficacy and tolerability profile from the completed phase  studies we believe pyridorin has the potential to address an important unmet need in type  diabetic patients with advanced kidney disease our phase  trial pyr the first of two identical trials in our pioneer program is evaluating the safety and efficacy of pyridorin to reduce disease progression in this patient population see clinical trials the design of the trial has been agreed with the fda under a special protocol assessment and

structure similar to but distinct from vitamin b pyridoxine unlike vitamin b pyridoxamine is regulated as an investigational drug candidate by the us food and drug administration the compound has a distinct structure and is comprised of a pyridine ring containing hydroxyl methyl aminomethyl hydroxymethyl and phenol substituent groups this structure enables pyridorin to preferentially bind to a variety of molecules which include • scavenging activity toward free radical and carbonyl compounds that form during the breakdown of sugars and lipids that can lead to age formation • trapping hydroxyl radicals a highly reactive and shortlived neutral form of the hydroxide ion ho− • redox metal binding activity eg copper cu manganese mn and iron fe which inhibits the oxidation of amadori
