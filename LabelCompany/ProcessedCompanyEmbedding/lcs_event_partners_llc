letter to new seniors chairman and members of its board of directors september   new senior investment group inc  avenue of the americas th floor new york ny  attention wesley r edens chairman of the board cc board of directors dear wes in my long experience in the investment management business i have spoken to members of company boards of directors and management teams about my views on numerous occasions but this marks the first time that i am sending a public letter to the chairman of the board of directors and members of its board of directors i take this communication seriously and i sincerely hope that you will as well since the effective date of the spinoff from newcastle investment corp on november   new senior investment group new senior share price has declined  versus the msci us reit index decline of  and the sp  decline of  as reported on bloomberg while operating results of the company have been strong with increasing occupancy at your properties and significant growth in funds from operations ffo led by ceo susan givens the issue with your stock valuation is not one of business performance but fundamentally one of structure and alignment of shareholder interest the external management structure is one that can lead to serious conflicts of interest while we have no issue with management at any company succeeding alongside of shareholders we believe the structure currently in place between new senior and fortress leaves the interests of shareholders and management significantly misaligned on may th  on fortress second quarter conference call you said the following regarding the fortress permanent capital vehicle pcv business that includes new senior the goal for that business from my standpoint is going to be  billion to  billion in capital by the end of the year its  billion right now since you made this statement the companies externally managed by fortress that were spun out of newcastle have dramatically underperformed with new senior down  new residential down  and new media down  as compared with the sp  decline of  and the msci us reit index decline of  as reported on bloomberg that includes dividends paid as the chairman of each of these companies you have a fiduciary duty to their public shareholders and that duty conflicts with your role at fortress and specifically with fortress desire to raise capital in these vehicles to increase its fee streams setting targets for capital raising may or may not be helpful in getting fortress stock price up but it sends a terrible message to the shareholders of companies that are externally managed by fortress as we know this issue of equity capital raise played out in new senior before the end of the second quarter and is the main reason in our view for the precipitous stock decline versus benchmarks on june nd new senior announced an equity offering underwritten by bank of america merrill lynch citigroup and morgan stanley to raise capital to purchase properties in a related party transaction from a privatelyheld fortress affiliate holiday retirement holiday the announcement came with new senior trading at  per share already well below our estimated net asset value nav and was then executed approximately  lower at  per share we believe the equity offering was mistimed and inopportune and doing an equity offering well below nav was extremely troubling we believe this has created the perception that fortress has little regard for public shareholders new senior stock closed at  on september   the stock price has now dropped an additional  from the  offering and  below the  it was trading at before the offering was announced with new seniors stock trading dramatically below nav we call upon fortress to take meaningful action to demonstrate a more appropriate balance between the external manager and the public shareholders in order to help bridge the substantial value discrepancy we understand that new senior has been a standalone public entity for less than a year but fortress has not earned the benefit of the doubt that they care about shareholder value in this and its other permanent capital vehicles it is our view that the current structure does not align fortress interest closely enough to new senior shareholders until demonstrable actions are taken potentially across the entire fortress permanent capital universe we believe these discounts to nav will persist if fortress wants to be in the longterm business of taking private equity fee streams in public equity vehicles we firmly believe that it must behave in a way that demonstrates appreciation that shareholder value is essential by rebuilding trust with the public markets we believe fortress will benefit greatly and be able to continue to grow its permanent capital businesses and succeed alongside of shareholders levin capital strategies looks forward to working constructively with you and the new senior board of directors as well as susan givens who we hold in high regard and her management team to further explore these issues we would like to address the external management structure and ways to further align fortress compensation to stock price performance a path toward internalization of management board composition and independence and stock buyback and potential liquidation if the gap between the market price and nav persists we stand ready to meet with you at your earliest convenience sincerely john levin » about us  e memorial blvd lakeland fl    about us affiliation accreditation events courses and

as such we adhere the to following truths we do not require that schools teach these doctrines specifically however open opposition to these may be grounds for dismissal if you have any questions or concerns please contact the lcs office directly we believe… and declare his design and plan for mankindthe scriptures are inspired by god we believe…revealed in three persons…father son and holy spirit commonly known as the trinitythere is only one true god we believe…in the deity of the lord jesus christ as god’s son jesus was both human and divine we believe…though originally good man willingly fell to sinushering evil and death both physical and spiritual into the world we believe… trusting christ through faith and repentance to be our personal savior  of  cardinal doctrines of the agevery person can have restored fellowship with god through ‘salvation’ we believe…and practice two ordinances water baptism by immersion after repenting of one’s sins and receiving christ’s gift of salvation and  holy communion the lord’s supper as a symbolic remembrance of christ’s suffering and death for our salvation we believe…the baptism in the holy spirit is a special experience following salvation that empowers believers for witnessing and effective service just as it did in new testament times  of  cardinal doctrines of the ag we believe… the initial physical evidence of the baptism in the holy spirit is ‘speaking in tongues’ as experienced on the day of pentecost and referenced throughout acts and the epistles we believe…sanctification initially occurs at salvation and is not only a declaration that a believer is holy but also a progressive lifelong process of separating from evil as believers continually draw closer to god and become more christlike we believe…the church has a mission to seek and save all who are lost in sin we believe ‘the church’ is the body of christ and consists of the people who throughout time have accepted god’s offer of redemption regardless of religious denomination through the sacrificial death of his son jesus christ we believe…a divinely called and scripturally ordained leadership ministry serves the church the bible teaches that each of us under leadership must commit ourselves to reach others for christ to worship him with other believers to build up or edify the body of believersthe church and to meet human need with ministries of love and compassion we believe…divine healing of the sick is a privilege for christians today and is provided for in christ’s atonement his sacrificial death on the cross for our sins  of  cardinal doctrines of the ag we believe…in the blessed hopewhen jesus raptures his church prior to his return to earth the second coming at this future moment in time all believers who have died will rise from their graves and will meet the lord in the air and christians who are alive will be caught up with them to be with the lord forever  of  cardinal doctrines of the ag we believe…in the millennial reign of christ when jesus returns with his saints at his second coming and begins his benevolent rule over earth for  years this millennial reign will bring the salvation of national israel and the establishment of universal peace we believe…a final judgment will take place for those who have rejected christ they will be judged for their sin and consigned to eternal punishment in a punishing lake of fire we believe…and look forward to the perfect new heavens and a new earth that christ is preparing for all people of all time who have accepted him we will live and dwell with him there forever following his millennial reign on earth ‘and so shall we forever be with the lord’ in an effort to clarify our mission objectives and philosophical framework lcs takes
