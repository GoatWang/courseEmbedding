secure a seat on the companys board two sources close to the matter said on friday valueact which wants a say in the way the worlds largest software company is adapting to the new world of mobile computing is seeking to nominate a person from its own organization the sources said the news comes as microsoft had its biggest selloff in four years wiping  billion off its market value after quarterly results were hit by weak demand for its latest windows system and poor sales of its surface tablet san franciscobased valueact which manages more than  billion for clients owned  million microsoft shares as of march which is  percent of total shares outstanding but it is believed to be buying more the fund cofounded by finance industry veteran jeff ubben in  has made a reputation for building stakes in companies and working with management in private to change fundamental strategy valueacts other major holdings include adobe systems inc motorola solutions inc and valeant pharmaceuticals international inc in recent months a number of microsofts top institutional investors have contacted valueact expressing concern over management execution and strategy the sources said high among the issues in the talks which the sources described as ongoing is the apparent lack of succession planning at the top of the company steve ballmer has held the chief executive job since  and shows no signs of relinquishing it ballmer  once remarked that he envisaged staying on until his youngest child goes to college which would be around  or  but since then he has not publicly addressed the matter valueact and microsoft declined to comment the software company has previously said there is a ceo succession plan in place but has declined to give details of it under pressure microsofts huge stock drop on friday prompted by its financial results and a  million writedown on the value of unsold surface tablets provoked fresh skepticism of ballmers new plan to reshape microsoft around devices and services the recent reorganization does not fix the tablet or smartphone problem nomura analyst rick sherlund said in a note to clients on friday the devices opportunity just received a  million hardware writeoff for surface rt and investors may not even like the idea of wading deeper into this territory valueact is thought to oppose microsofts recent foray into making its own devices microsoft and ballmer have been the targets of much criticism over the past decade chiefly for falling behind apple inc and google inc in the shift toward mobile computing the company however has not been subjected to much overt protestation from shareholders the most public challenge came two years ago when greenlight capitals david einhorn who made his name warning about lehman brothers financial health before the investment banks collapse called for ballmer to step down microsoft never responded publicly to that call and the companys board has never indicated any major disapproval with ballmers performance although it did trim his bonus last year for sagging windows sales and a mistake that led to a massive fine by european regulators valueact may find it difficult to stir up change at microsoft even if it does get a seat on the board given that cofounder and chairman bill gates has long been a solid supporter of his old friend and colleague ballmer gates who founded microsoft in  with paul allen still owns about  percent of the company and is the largest individual shareholder ballmer who is also on the board owns about  percent alongside gates and ballmer seven independent directors make up microsofts nineperson board the lead independent director is john thompson a former symantec corp and ibm executive microsofts shares closed down  percent at  on nasdaq on friday but recovered slightly to  in afterhours trading after the news that board members were in talks with valueact reporting by nadia damouni in new york and bill rigby in
