meet the exec chris dedicoat by liza meak lizameak theres more to chris dedicoat executive vp of worldwide sales than just closing the deal we recently talked to him about another one of his passions protecting the environment and endangered animals april   want to know how cisco helps save the rhinos i did to find that answer i went to chris dedicoat ciscos executive vice president of worldwide sales chris passion for the environment specifically endangered animals is immediately evident but so is his belief of ciscos responsibility on a global level focus magazine as executive vp of worldwide sales and field operations some people might not think you would have much input on ciscos commitment to the environment tell me why its so important for you to be a leader at a company that has supported environmental causes for decades cisco participates and provides leadership because i truly believe that some of the worlds biggest problems wont be solved by government in the future theyll be solved by responsible corporate organizations chris dedicoat i feel that there are three key constituents first employees want to work for companies that take responsibility for the environment for which they operate in around the globe cisco participates and provides leadership because i truly believe that some of the worlds biggest problems wont be solved by governments in the future rather theyll be solved by responsible corporate organizations doing the right thing for their business and also for the world – in this case for the environment in particular big companies are polluters so i think its important to take responsibility and do everything we possibly can second many of our partners want to see us lead in this area so they can be part of that initiative as well third its about our customers  our products produce heat and our customers want and need to understand the power consumption they also want to understand what responsibilities we take in our supply chain – how we manage it and ensure that we are as energy efficient as possible and using environmental design principles in products transportation and manufacturing after the product has exceeded its useful life customers would like to see cisco achieving 0 percent returns on all products so we can recycle and extract precious metals and plastics from those products to reduce landfill waste  focus magazine what do you think are some of the most exciting opportunities when it comes to tech and the environment in terms of promoting environmental sustainability chris dedicoat we all know iot automates business processes technology plays a critical role in developing those business processes and ensuring the environment is a key consideration as companies implement next generation business models i think governments clearly have a part to play there because they mandate in certain states and certain parts of the globe but i also believe the only way to really solve the issues is through the iot technology the next area is what weve been trying to do as a company for me it was important as we embarked on our journey many years ago to focus on carbon emissions which is something we did with the clinton global initiative that morphed into how we looked at the world differently and we embraced the principles of the circular economy   i tried to be a leader for the circular economy inside the company with our initial partnership with the ellen macarthur foundationthis relationship put cisco front and center on a global level with many of our key customers they began to see cisco as a company that really embraced the principles of the circular economy and demonstrated responsibility across all aspects of the environment when we first embarked on that it was clear there was a great opportunity for us to lead before ciscos association with the clinton global initiative and the ellen macarthur foundation i felt frustrated that we werent as concerned about it as a company as we needed to be the only person i saw that was really really embracing it was john kern ciscos svp of supply chain operations who was doing so much in the supply chain where it was very important additionally we started to see that the environment was an important aspect in our product development particularly in rowan trollopes organization our products consume energy and for customers power consumption is obviously a key consideration – particularly in large service providers and in data centers working with the ellen macarthur foundation allowed us to participate and demonstrate our committment to the environment at events like the world economic forum where the circular economy is a wellknown theorem and practice amongst attending companies   focus magazine what do you think it was that put cisco at the forefront of being an environmentally conscious leader chris dedicoat john kern ensured that we were using an environmentally diverse supply chain and wherever we could extracting precious metals and plastics from products that exceeded their useful life that was a pretty leading thing for us to do as a company and i think it was a great example to illustrate ciscos commitment to the environment i think that also encouraged us to look at different projects with our partners –  as an example the work we are doing with dimension data in south africa to help protect endangered species such as rhinos focus magazine can you tell me how cisco got involved with helping endangered rhinos chris dedicoat one of travesties in the world is the plight of some of the creatures that exist in the major game reserves throughout africa in particular the rhino was under incredible pressure from poaching and the world trade of rhino horn our partner dimension data is based in johannesburg south africa and a number of its employees and leaders are passionate about the rhinos and protecting the game reserves there because of that dimension data began exploring how technology could play a role in protecting the rhino in a different way than had been done in the past previously people had tried using technologies like electronic tagging the problem with electronic tagging is that the bad people find out the frequencies the tags emit and use it unfortunately to track the rhino collectively between cisco and dimension data we came up with a multidimensional plan and an alternative approach it involved sensoring fences using high definition airborne cameras with drone technologies and active participation by teams in helicopters most of the attacks happen at night so the cameras have infrared imagery capabilities now the rhinos are protected  hours a day after implementing the new technology the number of rhinos being poached dropped dramatically –to almost zero last year the world wildlife foundation shared this project with the wildlife funders as a new concept of protecting the most vulnerable wildlife near extinction the second phase of this is going to be a project in zambia were now looking at using the same principles and technologies to protect the elephants on a much bigger scale  well also have the full support of the world wildlife fund theyre able to get governments on board to help put regulations in place dimension data cisco and the world wildlife fund are using the next generation of technologies to protect the animals that we havent historically been able to protect this project has also allowed many cisco employees to participate for example some of the best minds in cisco have been applied to this project and theres a huge amount of enthusiasm  we have employees that have volunteered to be out there on the ground in the fight against poachers for me its just a proud moment to see the company rallying to apply our technology our people our brain power and our willingness to do good things i think this action really gives an insight into our culture  focus magazine can you tell me from a personal standpoint why this is so important to you chris dedicoat having been to the game reserves a few times myself i think its tremendous that were in this position and have the capabilities to help and most importantly that we have the willingness of people to be engaged  i feel passionate that we have to do what we can to help those that cant protect themselves i put the plight of animals in that category it makes me feel good that we can do something to help them and that were doing the best that we can for this generation and future generations  the contents or
