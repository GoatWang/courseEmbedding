homeare we right for youabout uscontact us account infoportfolio holdingsresearch blog are we right for you we build and manage diversified equity and fixed income strategies which are suitable for clients of varying age risk tolerance objectives and liquidity all strategies revolve around the selection of securities based on our research and analysis of individual companies industries and longterm social demographic and economic trends by contrast an increasing number of firms pursue marketexposure based strategies  asset allocation models using bundled securities such as etfs or other structured synthetic securities such models tend to be built on backwardlooking analysis and may involve risks that are less clear than for individual securities our approach is based on certain beliefs   using primarily individual unbundled securities is an important aspect of controlling risk and achieving the best potential return for a given level of risk  as an equity investor understanding your risk tolerance in advance is essential because individual stocks and equity account values can fluctuate substantially as prices react or overreact to temporary changes in the business and economic outlook and to intangibles such as market confidence investor perception and emotional bias  over a long period of time intangibles have minimal impact while investment returns primarily reflect the success and value of the underlying businesses in relation to purchase price  owning businesses that are managed for the longterm financial success of their shareholders are competitively wellpositioned in their industry and provide products and services for which demand is sustainable and growing is an enduring strategy to achieve longterm investment results   “b”
