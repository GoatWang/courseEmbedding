relatively lowrisk investment product where the insured usually an individual pays a life insurance company a lumpsum premium at the start of the contract that money is to be paid back to the insured in fixed incremental amounts over some future period predetermined by the insured the insurer invests the premium the resulting profitreturn on investment funds the payments received by the insured and compensate the insurer conventional annuity contracts provide a predictable guaranteed stream of future income eg for retirement until the deaths of the beneficiariess named in the contract or until a future termination date — whichever occurs first contents  history  general  immediate annuity  annuity with period certain  life annuity  life annuity variants  deferred annuity  features  criticisms of deferred annuities  taxation  insurance company default risk and state guaranty associations  compensation for advisors or salespeople  references  external links historyedit although annuities have existed in their present form only for a few decades the idea of paying out a stream of income to an individual or family dates back to the roman empire the latin word annua meant annual stipends and during the reign of the emperors the word signified a contract that made annual payments individuals would make a single large payment into the annua and then receive an annual payment each year until death or for a specified period of time the roman speculator and jurist gnaeus domitius annius ulpianus is cited as one of the earliest dealers of these annuities and he is also credited with creating the first actuarial life table roman soldiers were paid annuities as a form of compensation for military service during the middle ages annuities were used by feudal lords and kings to help cover the heavy costs of their constant wars and conflicts with each other at this time annuities were offered in the form of a tontine or a large pool of cash from which payments were made to investors one of the early recorded uses of annuities in the united states was by the presbyterian church in  the purpose was to provide a secure retirement to aging ministers and their families and was later expanded to assist widows and orphans in  pennsylvania company insurance was among the first to begin offering annuities to the general public in the united states some prominent figures who are noted for their use of annuities include benjamin franklin assisting the cities of boston and philadelphia babe ruth avoiding losses during the great depression o j simpson protecting his income from lawsuits and creditors ben bernanke in  disclosed that his major financial assets are two annuities generaledit annuity contracts in the united states are defined by the internal revenue code and regulated by the individual states variable annuities have features of both life insurance and investment products in the us annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to nonprofits to reduce taxes insurance companies are regulated by the states so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others their federal tax treatment however is governed by the internal revenue code variable annuities are regulated by the securities and exchange commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by the financial industry regulatory authority finra the largest nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the united states there are two possible phases for an annuity one phase in which the customer deposits and accumulates money into an account the deferral phase and another phase in which customers receive payments for some period of time the annuity or income phase during this latter phase the insurance company makes income payments that may be set for a stated period of time such as five years or continue until the death of the customers the annuitants named in the contract annuitization over a lifetime can have a death benefit guarantee over a certain period of time such as ten years annuity contracts with a deferral phase always have an annuity phase and are called deferred annuities an annuity contract may also be structured so that it has only the annuity phase such a contract is called an immediate annuity note this is not always the case immediate annuityedit the term annuity as used in financial theory is most closely related to what is today called an immediate annuity this is an insurance policy which in exchange for a sum of money guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments these payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives or even whichever is longer it is also possible to structure the payments under an immediate annuity so that they vary with the performance of a specified set of investments usually bond and equity mutual funds such a contract is called a variable immediate annuity see also life annuity below the overarching characteristic of the immediate annuity is that it is a vehicle for distributing savings with a taxdeferred growth factor a common use for an immediate annuity might be to provide a pension income in the us the tax treatment of a nonqualified immediate annuity is that every payment is a combination of a return of principal which part is not taxed and income which is taxed at ordinary income rates not capital gain rates immediate annuities funded as an ira do not have any tax advantages but typically the distribution satisfies the irs rmd requirement and may satisfy the rmd requirement for other ira accounts of the owner see irs sec a when a deferred annuity is annuitized it works like an immediate annuity from that point on but with a lower cost basis and thus more of the payment is taxed annuity with period certainedit this type of immediate annuity pays the annuitant for a designated number of years ie a period certain and is used to fund a need that will end when the period is up for example it might be used to fund the premiums for a term life insurance policy thus the person may outlive the number of years the annuity will pay life annuityedit main article life annuity a life or lifetime immediate annuity is used to provide an income for the life of the annuitant similar to a defined benefit or pension plan a life annuity works somewhat like a loan that is made by the purchaser contract owner to the issuing insurance company which pays back the original capital or principal which isnt taxed with interest andor gains which is taxed as ordinary income to the annuitant on whose life the annuity is based the assumed period of the loan is based on the life expectancy of the annuitant in order to guarantee that the income continues for life the insurance company relies on a concept called crosssubsidy or the law of large numbers because an annuity population can be expected to have a distribution of lifespans around the populations mean average age those dying earlier will give up income to support those living longer whose money would otherwise run out thus it is a form of longevity insurance see also below a life annuity ideally can reduce the problem faced by a person when they dont know how long they will live and so they dont know the optimal speed at which to spend their savings life annuities with payments indexed to the consumer price index might be an acceptable solution to this problem but there is only a thin market for them in north america life annuity variantsedit for an additional expense either by way of an increase in payments premium or a decrease in benefits an annuity or benefit rider can be purchased on another life such as a spouse family member or friend for the duration of whose life the annuity is wholly or partly guaranteed for example it is common to buy an annuity which will continue to pay out to the spouse of the annuitant after death for so long as the spouse survives the annuity paid to the spouse is called a reversionary annuity or survivorship annuity however if the annuitant is in good health it may be more advantageous to select the higher payout option on his or her life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor the pure life annuity can have harsh consequences for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract such a situation called a forfeiture can be mitigated by the addition of a periodcertain feature under which the annuity issuer is required to make annuity payments for at least a certain number of years if the annuitant outlives the specified period certain annuity payments continue until the annuitants death and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain the annuitants estate or beneficiary is entitled to the remaining payments certain the tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller a viable alternative to the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is to purchase a singlepremium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity impairedlife annuities for smokers or those with a particular illness are also available from some insurance companies since the life expectancy is reduced the annual payment to the purchaser is raised life annuities are priced based on the probability of the annuitant surviving to receive the payments longevity insurance is a form of annuity that defers commencement of the payments until very late in life a common longevity contract would be purchased at or before retirement but would not commence payments until  years after retirement if the nominee dies before payments commence there is no payable benefit this drastically reduces the cost of the annuity while still providing protection against outliving ones resources deferred annuityedit the second usage for the term annuity came into being during the s such a contract is more properly referred to as a deferred annuity and is chiefly a vehicle for accumulating savings with a view to eventually distributing them either in the manner of an immediate annuity or as a lumpsum payment all varieties of deferred annuities owned by individuals have one thing in common any increase in account values is not taxed until those gains are withdrawn this is also known as taxdeferred growth a deferred annuity which grows by interest rate earnings alone is called a fixed deferred annuity fa a deferred annuity that permits allocations to stock or bond funds and for which the account value is not guaranteed to stay above the initial amount invested is called a variable annuity va a new category of deferred annuity called the fixed indexed annuity fia emerged in  originally called an equityindexed annuity fixed indexed annuities may have features of both fixed and variable deferred annuities the insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return for eia an investor can still lose money if he or she cancels or surrenders the policy early before a break even period an oversimplified expression of a typical eias rate of return might be that it is equal to a stated participation rate multiplied by a target stock market indexs performance excluding dividends interest rate caps or an administrative fee may be applicable deferred annuities in the united states have the advantage that taxation of all capital gains and ordinary income is deferred until withdrawn in theory such taxdeferred compounding allows more money to be put to work while the savings are accumulating leading to higher returns a disadvantage however is that when amounts held under a deferred annuity are withdrawn or inherited the interestgains are immediately taxed as ordinary income featuresedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message a variety of features and guarantees have been developed by insurance companies in order to make annuity products more attractive these include death and living benefit options extra credit options account guarantees spousal continuation benefits reduced contingent deferred sales charges or surrender charges and various combinations thereof each feature or benefit added to a contract will typically be accompanied by an additional expense either directly billed to client or indirectly inside product deferred annuities are usually divided into two different kinds fixed annuities offer some sort of guaranteed rate of return over the life of the contract in general such contracts are often positioned to be somewhat like bank cds and offer a rate of return competitive with those of cds of similar time frames many fixed annuities however do not have a fixed rate of return over the life of the contract offering instead a guaranteed minimum rate and a first year introductory rate the rate after the first year is often an amount that may be set at the insurance companys discretion subject however to the minimum amount typically  there are usually some provisions in the contract to allow a percentage of the interest andor principal to be withdrawn early and without penalty usually the interest earned in a month period or  unlike most cds fixed annuities normally become fully liquid depending on the surrender schedule or upon the owners death most equity index annuities are properly categorized as fixed annuities and their performance is typically tied to a stock market index usually the sp  or the dow jones industrial average these products are guaranteed but are not as easy to understand as standard fixed annuities as there are usually caps spreads margins and crediting methods that can reduce returns these products also dont pay any of the participating market indices dividends the tradeoff is that contract holder can never earn less than  in a negative year variable annuities allow money to be invested in insurance company separate accounts which are sometimes referred to as subaccounts and in any case are functionally similar to mutual funds in a taxdeferred manner their primary use is to allow an investor to engage in taxdeferred investing for retirement in amounts greater than permitted by individual retirement or k plans in addition many variable annuity contracts offer a guaranteed minimum rate of return either for a future withdrawal andor in the case of the owners death even if the underlying separate account investments perform poorly this can be attractive to people uncomfortable investing in the equity markets without the guarantees of course an investor will pay for each benefit provided by a variable annuity since insurance companies must charge a premium to cover the insurance guarantees of such benefits variable annuities are regulated both by the individual states as insurance products and by the securities and exchange commission as securities under the federal securities laws the sec requires that all of the charges under variable annuities be described in great detail in the prospectus that is offered to each variable annuity customer of course potential customers should review these charges carefully just as one would in purchasing mutual fund shares people who sell variable annuities are usually regulated by finra whose rules of conduct require a careful analysis of the suitability of variable annuities and other securities products to those to whom they recommend such products these products are often criticized as being sold to the wrong persons who could have done better investing in a more suitable alternative since the commissions paid under this product are often high relative to other investment products there are several types of performance guarantees and one may often choose them à la carte with higher risk charges for guarantees that are riskier for the insurance companies the first type is a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb which can be received only if the owner of the annuity contract or the covered annuitant dies gmdbs come in various flavors in order of increasing risk to the insurance company return of premium a guarantee that you will not have a negative return rollup of premium at a particular rate a guarantee that you will achieve a minimum rate of return greater than  maximum anniversary value looks back at account value on the anniversaries and guarantees you will get at least as much as the highest values upon death greater of maximum anniversary value or particular rollup insurance companies provide even greater insurance coverage on guaranteed living benefits which tend to be elective unlike death benefits which the contractholder generally cannot time living benefits pose significant risk for insurance companies as contractholders will likely exercise these benefits when they are worth the most annuities with guaranteed living benefits glbs tend to have high fees commensurate with the additional risks underwritten by the issuing insurer some glb examples in no particular order guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib a guarantee that one will get a minimum income stream upon annuitization at a particular point in the future guaranteed minimum accumulation lbenefit gmab a guarantee that the account value will be at a certain amount at a certain point in the future guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb a guarantee similar to the income benefit but one that doesnt require annuitizing guaranteedforlife income benefit a guarantee similar to a withdrawal benefit where withdrawals begin and continue until cash value becomes zero withdrawals stop when cash value is zero and then annuitization occurs on the guaranteed benefit amount for a payment amount that is not determined until annuitization date recently insurance companies developed assettransfer programs that operate at the contract level or the fund level in the former a percentage of clients account value will be transferred to a designated lowrisk fund when the contract has poor investment performance on the fund level certain investment options have a target volatility built within the fund usually about  and will rebalance to maintain that target in both cases they are stated to help buffer poor investment performance until markets perform better where they will transition back to normal allocations to catch an upswing however there are criticisms of these programs including but not limited to often mandating these programs on clients restricting flexibility of investing and not catching the upswing of markets fast enough due to the underlying design of such programs be careful in regard to using glb riders in nonqualified contracts as most of the products in the annuity marketplace today create a  taxable income benefit whereas income generated from an immediate annuity in a nonqualified contract would partially be a return of principal and therefore nontaxable criticisms of deferred annuitiesedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message some annuities do not have any deferred surrender charges and do not pay the financial professional a commission although the financial professional may charge a fee for his or her advice these contracts are called noload variable annuity products and are usually available from a feebased financial planner or directly from a noload mutual fund company of course various charges are still imposed on these contracts but they are less than those sold by commissioned brokers it is important that potential purchasers of annuities mutual funds taxexempt municipal bonds commodities futures interest rate swaps in short any financial instrument understand the fees on the product and the fees a financial planner may charge variable annuities are controversial because many believe the extra fees ie the fees above and beyond those charged for similar retail mutual funds that offer no principal protection or guarantees of any kind may reduce the rate of return compared to what the investor could make by investing directly in similar investments outside of the variable annuity a big selling point for variable annuities is the guarantees many have such as the guarantee that the customer will not lose his or her principal critics say that these guarantees are not necessary because over the long term the market has always been positive while others say that with the uncertainty of the financial markets many investors simply will not invest without guaranteeswho past returns are no guarantee of future performance of course and different investors have different risk tolerances different investment horizons different family situations and so on the sale of any security product should involve a careful analysis of the suitability of the product for a given individual taxationedit in the us internal revenue code the growth of the annuity value during the accumulation phase is taxdeferred that is not subject to current income tax for annuities owned by individuals the tax deferred status of deferred annuities has led to their common usage in the united states under the us tax code the benefits from annuity contracts do not always have to be taken in the form of a fixed stream of payments annuitization and many annuity contracts are bought primarily for the tax benefits rather than to receive a fixed stream of income if an annuity is used in a qualified pension plan or an ira funding vehicle then  of the annuity payment is taxable as current income upon distribution because the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the annuity it should be noted this is the same tax treatment of direct participation in a qualified pension plan such as a k again due to the fact the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the plan if the annuity contract is purchased with aftertax dollars then the contract holder upon annuitization recovers his basis prorata in the ratio of basis divided by the expected value according to the tax regulation section  this is commonly referred to as the exclusion ratio after the taxpayer has recovered all of his basis then  of the payments thereafter are subject to ordinary income tax since the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  the use of variable annuities as a tax shelter has greatly diminished because the growth of mutual funds and now most of the dividends of the fund are taxed at long term capital gains rates this taxation contrasted with the taxation of all the growth of variable annuities at income rates means that in most cases variable annuities shouldnt be used for tax shelters unless very long holding periods apply for example more than  years insurance company default risk and state guaranty associationsedit main article guaranty association an investor should consider the financial strength of the insurance company that writes annuity contracts major insolvencies have occurred at least  times since the conspicuous collapse of the executive life insurance company in  insurance company defaults are governed by state law the laws are however broadly similar in most states annuity contracts are protected against insurance company insolvency up to a specific dollar limit often  but as high as  in new york  new jersey  and the state of washington  california is the only state that has a limit less than  the limit is  up to  this protection is not insurance and is not provided by a government agency it is provided by an entity called the state guaranty association when an insolvency occurs the guaranty association steps in to protect annuity holders and decides what to do on a casebycase basis sometimes the contracts will be taken over and fulfilled by a solvent insurance company the state guaranty association is not a government agency but states usually require insurance companies to belong to it as a condition of being licensed to do business the guaranty associations of the fifty states are members of a national umbrella association the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations nolhga the nolhga website provides a description of the organization links to websites for the individual state organizations and links to the actual text of the governing state laws a difference between guaranty association protection and the protection of bank accounts by the fdic credit union accounts by the ncua and brokerage accounts by the sipc is that it is difficult for consumers to learn about this protection usually state law prohibits insurance agents and companies from using the guaranty association in any advertising and agents are prohibited by statute from using this web site or the existence of the guaranty association as an inducement to purchase insuranceeg  presumably this is a response to concerns by stronger insurance companies about moral hazard compensation for advisors or salespeopleedit deferred annuities including fixed fixed indexed and variable typically pay the advisor or salesperson  percent to  percent of the amount invested as a commission with possible trail options of  basis points to  percent sometimes the advisor can select his payout option which might be either  or  percent up front or  percent up front with a  basis point trail or  percent to  percent up front with a  percent trail trail commissions are most common in variable annuities while fixed annuities and fixed indexed annuities typically pay an up front commission some firms allow an investor to pick an annuity share class which determines the salespersons commission schedule the main variables are the upfront commission and the trail commission fixed and indexed annuity commissions are paid to the agent by the insurance companies the agent represents commissions are not paid by the client annuitant noload variable annuities are available on a directtoconsumer basis from several noload mutual fund companies noload means the products have no sales

template message in the united states an annuity is a contractually executed relatively lowrisk investment product where the insured usually an individual pays a life insurance company a lumpsum premium at the start of the contract that money is to be paid back to the insured in fixed incremental amounts over some future period predetermined by the insured the insurer invests the premium the resulting profitreturn on investment funds the payments received by the insured and compensate the insurer conventional annuity contracts provide a predictable guaranteed stream of future income eg for retirement until the deaths of the beneficiariess named in the contract or until a future termination date — whichever occurs first contents  history  general  immediate annuity  annuity with period certain  life annuity  life annuity variants  deferred annuity  features  criticisms of deferred annuities  taxation  insurance company default risk and state guaranty associations  compensation for advisors or salespeople  references  external links historyedit although annuities have existed in their present form only for a few decades the idea of paying out a stream of income to an individual or family dates back to the roman empire the latin word annua meant annual stipends and during the reign of the emperors the word signified a contract that made annual payments individuals would make a single large payment into the annua and then receive an annual payment each year until death or for a specified period of time the roman speculator and jurist gnaeus domitius annius ulpianus is cited as one of the earliest dealers of these annuities and he is also credited with creating the first actuarial life table roman soldiers were paid annuities as a form of compensation for military service during the middle ages annuities were used by feudal lords and kings to help cover the heavy costs of their constant wars and conflicts with each other at this time annuities were offered in the form of a tontine or a large pool of cash from which payments were made to investors one of the early recorded uses of annuities in the united states was by the presbyterian church in  the purpose was to provide a secure retirement to aging ministers and their families and was later expanded to assist widows and orphans in  pennsylvania company insurance was among the first to begin offering annuities to the general public in the united states some prominent figures who are noted for their use of annuities include benjamin franklin assisting the cities of boston and philadelphia babe ruth avoiding losses during the great depression o j simpson protecting his income from lawsuits and creditors ben bernanke in  disclosed that his major financial assets are two annuities generaledit annuity contracts in the united states are defined by the internal revenue code and regulated by the individual states variable annuities have features of both life insurance and investment products in the us annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to nonprofits to reduce taxes insurance companies are regulated by the states so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others their federal tax treatment however is governed by the internal revenue code variable annuities are regulated by the securities and exchange commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by the financial industry regulatory authority finra the largest nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the united states there are two possible phases for an annuity one phase in which the customer deposits and accumulates money into an account the deferral phase and another phase in which customers receive payments for some period of time the annuity or income phase during this latter phase the insurance company makes income payments that may be set for a stated period of time such as five years or continue until the death of the customers the annuitants named in the contract annuitization over a lifetime can have a death benefit guarantee over a certain period of time such as ten years annuity contracts with a deferral phase always have an annuity phase and are called deferred annuities an annuity contract may also be structured so that it has only the annuity phase such a contract is called an immediate annuity note this is not always the case immediate annuityedit the term annuity as used in financial theory is most closely related to what is today called an immediate annuity this is an insurance policy which in exchange for a sum of money guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments these payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives or even whichever is longer it is also possible to structure the payments under an immediate annuity so that they vary with the performance of a specified set of investments usually bond and equity mutual funds such a contract is called a variable immediate annuity see also life annuity below the overarching characteristic of the immediate annuity is that it is a vehicle for distributing savings with a taxdeferred growth factor a common use for an immediate annuity might be to provide a pension income in the us the tax treatment of a nonqualified immediate annuity is that every payment is a combination of a return of principal which part is not taxed and income which is taxed at ordinary income rates not capital gain rates immediate annuities funded as an ira do not have any tax advantages but typically the distribution satisfies the irs rmd requirement and may satisfy the rmd requirement for other ira accounts of the owner see irs sec a when a deferred annuity is annuitized it works like an immediate annuity from that point on but with a lower cost basis and thus more of the payment is taxed annuity with period certainedit this type of immediate annuity pays the annuitant for a designated number of years ie a period certain and is used to fund a need that will end when the period is up for example it might be used to fund the premiums for a term life insurance policy thus the person may outlive the number of years the annuity will pay life annuityedit main article life annuity a life or lifetime immediate annuity is used to provide an income for the life of the annuitant similar to a defined benefit or pension plan a life annuity works somewhat like a loan that is made by the purchaser contract owner to the issuing insurance company which pays back the original capital or principal which isnt taxed with interest andor gains which is taxed as ordinary income to the annuitant on whose life the annuity is based the assumed period of the loan is based on the life expectancy of the annuitant in order to guarantee that the income continues for life the insurance company relies on a concept called crosssubsidy or the law of large numbers because an annuity population can be expected to have a distribution of lifespans around the populations mean average age those dying earlier will give up income to support those living longer whose money would otherwise run out thus it is a form of longevity insurance see also below a life annuity ideally can reduce the problem faced by a person when they dont know how long they will live and so they dont know the optimal speed at which to spend their savings life annuities with payments indexed to the consumer price index might be an acceptable solution to this problem but there is only a thin market for them in north america life annuity variantsedit for an additional expense either by way of an increase in payments premium or a decrease in benefits an annuity or benefit rider can be purchased on another life such as a spouse family member or friend for the duration of whose life the annuity is wholly or partly guaranteed for example it is common to buy an annuity which will continue to pay out to the spouse of the annuitant after death for so long as the spouse survives the annuity paid to the spouse is called a reversionary annuity or survivorship annuity however if the annuitant is in good health it may be more advantageous to select the higher payout option on his or her life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor the pure life annuity can have harsh consequences for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract such a situation called a forfeiture can be mitigated by the addition of a periodcertain feature under which the annuity issuer is required to make annuity payments for at least a certain number of years if the annuitant outlives the specified period certain annuity payments continue until the annuitants death and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain the annuitants estate or beneficiary is entitled to the remaining payments certain the tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller a viable alternative to the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is to purchase a singlepremium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity impairedlife annuities for smokers or those with a particular illness are also available from some insurance companies since the life expectancy is reduced the annual payment to the purchaser is raised life annuities are priced based on the probability of the annuitant surviving to receive the payments longevity insurance is a form of annuity that defers commencement of the payments until very late in life a common longevity contract would be purchased at or before retirement but would not commence payments until  years after retirement if the nominee dies before payments commence there is no payable benefit this drastically reduces the cost of the annuity while still providing protection against outliving ones resources deferred annuityedit the second usage for the term annuity came into being during the s such a contract is more properly referred to as a deferred annuity and is chiefly a vehicle for accumulating savings with a view to eventually distributing them either in the manner of an immediate annuity or as a lumpsum payment all varieties of deferred annuities owned by individuals have one thing in common any increase in account values is not taxed until those gains are withdrawn this is also known as taxdeferred growth a deferred annuity which grows by interest rate earnings alone is called a fixed deferred annuity fa a deferred annuity that permits allocations to stock or bond funds and for which the account value is not guaranteed to stay above the initial amount invested is called a variable annuity va a new category of deferred annuity called the fixed indexed annuity fia emerged in  originally called an equityindexed annuity fixed indexed annuities may have features of both fixed and variable deferred annuities the insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return for eia an investor can still lose money if he or she cancels or surrenders the policy early before a break even period an oversimplified expression of a typical eias rate of return might be that it is equal to a stated participation rate multiplied by a target stock market indexs performance excluding dividends interest rate caps or an administrative fee may be applicable deferred annuities in the united states have the advantage that taxation of all capital gains and ordinary income is deferred until withdrawn in theory such taxdeferred compounding allows more money to be put to work while the savings are accumulating leading to higher returns a disadvantage however is that when amounts held under a deferred annuity are withdrawn or inherited the interestgains are immediately taxed as ordinary income featuresedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message a variety of features and guarantees have been developed by insurance companies in order to make annuity products more attractive these include death and living benefit options extra credit options account guarantees spousal continuation benefits reduced contingent deferred sales charges or surrender charges and various combinations thereof each feature or benefit added to a contract will typically be accompanied by an additional expense either directly billed to client or indirectly inside product deferred annuities are usually divided into two different kinds fixed annuities offer some sort of guaranteed rate of return over the life of the contract in general such contracts are often positioned to be somewhat like bank cds and offer a rate of return competitive with those of cds of similar time frames many fixed annuities however do not have a fixed rate of return over the life of the contract offering instead a guaranteed minimum rate and a first year introductory rate the rate after the first year is often an amount that may be set at the insurance companys discretion subject however to the minimum amount typically  there are usually some provisions in the contract to allow a percentage of the interest andor principal to be withdrawn early and without penalty usually the interest earned in a month period or  unlike most cds fixed annuities normally become fully liquid depending on the surrender schedule or upon the owners death most equity index annuities are properly categorized as fixed annuities and their performance is typically tied to a stock market index usually the sp  or the dow jones industrial average these products are guaranteed but are not as easy to understand as standard fixed annuities as there are usually caps spreads margins and crediting methods that can reduce returns these products also dont pay any of the participating market indices dividends the tradeoff is that contract holder can never earn less than  in a negative year variable annuities allow money to be invested in insurance company separate accounts which are sometimes referred to as subaccounts and in any case are functionally similar to mutual funds in a taxdeferred manner their primary use is to allow an investor to engage in taxdeferred investing for retirement in amounts greater than permitted by individual retirement or k plans in addition many variable annuity contracts offer a guaranteed minimum rate of return either for a future withdrawal andor in the case of the owners death even if the underlying separate account investments perform poorly this can be attractive to people uncomfortable investing in the equity markets without the guarantees of course an investor will pay for each benefit provided by a variable annuity since insurance companies must charge a premium to cover the insurance guarantees of such benefits variable annuities are regulated both by the individual states as insurance products and by the securities and exchange commission as securities under the federal securities laws the sec requires that all of the charges under variable annuities be described in great detail in the prospectus that is offered to each variable annuity customer of course potential customers should review these charges carefully just as one would in purchasing mutual fund shares people who sell variable annuities are usually regulated by finra whose rules of conduct require a careful analysis of the suitability of variable annuities and other securities products to those to whom they recommend such products these products are often criticized as being sold to the wrong persons who could have done better investing in a more suitable alternative since the commissions paid under this product are often high relative to other investment products there are several types of performance guarantees and one may often choose them à la carte with higher risk charges for guarantees that are riskier for the insurance companies the first type is a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb which can be received only if the owner of the annuity contract or the covered annuitant dies gmdbs come in various flavors in order of increasing risk to the insurance company return of premium a guarantee that you will not have a negative return rollup of premium at a particular rate a guarantee that you will achieve a minimum rate of return greater than  maximum anniversary value looks back at account value on the anniversaries and guarantees you will get at least as much as the highest values upon death greater of maximum anniversary value or particular rollup insurance companies provide even greater insurance coverage on guaranteed living benefits which tend to be elective unlike death benefits which the contractholder generally cannot time living benefits pose significant risk for insurance companies as contractholders will likely exercise these benefits when they are worth the most annuities with guaranteed living benefits glbs tend to have high fees commensurate with the additional risks underwritten by the issuing insurer some glb examples in no particular order guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib a guarantee that one will get a minimum income stream upon annuitization at a particular point in the future guaranteed minimum accumulation lbenefit gmab a guarantee that the account value will be at a certain amount at a certain point in the future guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb a guarantee similar to the income benefit but one that doesnt require annuitizing guaranteedforlife income benefit a guarantee similar to a withdrawal benefit where withdrawals begin and continue until cash value becomes zero withdrawals stop when cash value is zero and then annuitization occurs on the guaranteed benefit amount for a payment amount that is not determined until annuitization date recently insurance companies developed assettransfer programs that operate at the contract level or the fund level in the former a percentage of clients account value will be transferred to a designated lowrisk fund when the contract has poor investment performance on the fund level certain investment options have a target volatility built within the fund usually about  and will rebalance to maintain that target in both cases they are stated to help buffer poor investment performance until markets perform better where they will transition back to normal allocations to catch an upswing however there are criticisms of these programs including but not limited to often mandating these programs on clients restricting flexibility of investing and not catching the upswing of markets fast enough due to the underlying design of such programs be careful in regard to using glb riders in nonqualified contracts as most of the products in the annuity marketplace today create a  taxable income benefit whereas income generated from an immediate annuity in a nonqualified contract would partially be a return of principal and therefore nontaxable criticisms of deferred annuitiesedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message some annuities do not have any deferred surrender charges and do not pay the financial professional a commission although the financial professional may charge a fee for his or her advice these contracts are called noload variable annuity products and are usually available from a feebased financial planner or directly from a noload mutual fund company of course various charges are still imposed on these contracts but they are less than those sold by commissioned brokers it is important that potential purchasers of annuities mutual funds taxexempt municipal bonds commodities futures interest rate swaps in short any financial instrument understand the fees on the product and the fees a financial planner may charge variable annuities are controversial because many believe the extra fees ie the fees above and beyond those charged for similar retail mutual funds that offer no principal protection or guarantees of any kind may reduce the rate of return compared to what the investor could make by investing directly in similar investments outside of the variable annuity a big selling point for variable annuities is the guarantees many have such as the guarantee that the customer will not lose his or her principal critics say that these guarantees are not necessary because over the long term the market has always been positive while others say that with the uncertainty of the financial markets many investors simply will not invest without guaranteeswho past returns are no guarantee of future performance of course and different investors have different risk tolerances different investment horizons different family situations and so on the sale of any security product should involve a careful analysis of the suitability of the product for a given individual taxationedit in the us internal revenue code the growth of the annuity value during the accumulation phase is taxdeferred that is not subject to current income tax for annuities owned by individuals the tax deferred status of deferred annuities has led to their common usage in the united states under the us tax code the benefits from annuity contracts do not always have to be taken in the form of a fixed stream of payments annuitization and many annuity contracts are bought primarily for the tax benefits rather than to receive a fixed stream of income if an annuity is used in a qualified pension plan or an ira funding vehicle then  of the annuity payment is taxable as current income upon distribution because the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the annuity it should be noted this is the same tax treatment of direct participation in a qualified pension plan such as a k again due to the fact the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the plan if the annuity contract is purchased with aftertax dollars then the contract holder upon annuitization recovers his basis prorata in the ratio of basis divided by the expected value according to the tax regulation section  this is commonly referred to as the exclusion ratio after the taxpayer has recovered all of his basis then  of the payments thereafter are subject to ordinary income tax since the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  the use of variable annuities as a tax shelter has greatly diminished because the growth of mutual funds and now most of the dividends of the fund are taxed at long term capital gains rates this taxation contrasted with the taxation of all the growth of variable annuities at

guaranty associationsedit main article guaranty association an investor should consider the financial strength of the insurance company that writes annuity contracts major insolvencies have occurred at least  times since the conspicuous collapse of the executive life insurance company in  insurance company defaults are governed by state law the laws are however broadly similar in most states annuity contracts are protected against insurance company insolvency up to a specific dollar limit often  but as high as  in new york  new jersey  and the state of washington  california is the only state that has a limit less than  the limit is  up to  this protection is not insurance and is not provided by a government agency it is provided by an entity called the state guaranty association when an insolvency occurs the guaranty association steps in to protect annuity holders and decides what to do on a casebycase basis sometimes the contracts will be taken over and fulfilled by a solvent insurance company the state guaranty association is not a government agency but states usually require insurance companies to belong to it as a condition of being licensed to do business the guaranty associations of the fifty states are members of a national umbrella association the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations nolhga the nolhga website provides a description of the organization links to websites for the individual state organizations and links to the actual text of the governing state laws a difference between guaranty association protection and the protection of bank accounts by the fdic credit union accounts by the ncua and brokerage accounts by the sipc is that it is difficult for consumers to learn about this protection usually state law prohibits insurance agents and companies from using the guaranty association in any advertising and agents are prohibited by statute from using this web site or the existence of the guaranty association as an inducement to purchase insuranceeg  presumably this is a response to concerns by stronger insurance companies about moral hazard compensation for advisors or salespeopleedit deferred

the insured usually an individual pays a life insurance company a lumpsum premium at the start of the contract that money is to be paid back to the insured in fixed incremental amounts over some future period predetermined by the insured the insurer invests the premium the resulting profitreturn on investment funds the payments received by the insured and compensate the insurer conventional annuity contracts provide a predictable guaranteed stream of future income eg for retirement until the deaths of the beneficiariess named in the contract or until a future termination date — whichever occurs first contents  history  general  immediate annuity  annuity with period certain  life annuity  life annuity variants  deferred annuity  features  criticisms of deferred annuities  taxation  insurance company default risk and state guaranty associations  compensation for advisors or salespeople  references  external links historyedit although annuities have existed in their present form only for a few decades the idea of paying out a stream of income to an individual or family dates back to the roman empire the latin word annua meant annual stipends and during the reign of the emperors the word signified a contract that made annual payments individuals would make a single large payment into the annua and then receive an annual payment each year until death or for a specified period of time the roman speculator and jurist gnaeus domitius annius ulpianus is cited as one of the earliest dealers of these annuities and he is also credited with creating the first actuarial life table roman soldiers were paid annuities as a form of compensation for military service during the middle ages annuities were used by feudal lords and kings to help cover the heavy costs of their constant wars and conflicts with each other at this time annuities were offered in the form of a tontine or a large pool of cash from which payments were made to investors one of the early recorded uses of annuities in the united states was by the presbyterian church in  the purpose was to provide a secure retirement to aging ministers and their families and was later expanded to assist widows and orphans in  pennsylvania company insurance was among the first to begin offering annuities to the general public in the united states some prominent figures who are noted for their use of annuities include benjamin franklin assisting the cities of boston and philadelphia babe ruth avoiding losses during the great depression o j simpson protecting his income from lawsuits and creditors ben bernanke in  disclosed that his major financial assets are two annuities generaledit annuity contracts in the united states are defined by the internal revenue code and regulated by the individual states variable annuities have features of both life insurance and investment products in the us annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to nonprofits to reduce taxes insurance companies are regulated by the states so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others their federal tax treatment however is governed by the internal revenue code variable annuities are regulated by the securities and exchange commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by the financial industry regulatory authority finra the largest nongovernmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the united states there are two possible phases for an annuity one phase in which the customer deposits and accumulates money into an account the deferral phase and another phase in which customers receive payments for some period of time the annuity or income phase during this latter phase the insurance company makes income payments that may be set for a stated period of time such as five years or continue until the death of the customers the annuitants named in the contract annuitization over a lifetime can have a death benefit guarantee over a certain period of time such as ten years annuity contracts with a deferral phase always have an annuity phase and are called deferred annuities an annuity contract may also be structured so that it has only the annuity phase such a contract is called an immediate annuity note this is not always the case immediate annuityedit the term annuity as used in financial theory is most closely related to what is today called an immediate annuity this is an insurance policy which in exchange for a sum of money guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments these payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives or even whichever is longer it is also possible to structure the payments under an immediate annuity so that they vary with the performance of a specified set of investments usually bond and equity mutual funds such a contract is called a variable immediate annuity see also life annuity below the overarching characteristic of the immediate annuity is that it is a vehicle for distributing savings with a taxdeferred growth factor a common use for an immediate annuity might be to provide a pension income in the us the tax treatment of a nonqualified immediate annuity is that every payment is a combination of a return of principal which part is not taxed and income which is taxed at ordinary income rates not capital gain rates immediate annuities funded as an ira do not have any tax advantages but typically the distribution satisfies the irs rmd requirement and may satisfy the rmd requirement for other ira accounts of the owner see irs sec a when a deferred annuity is annuitized it works like an immediate annuity from that point on but with a lower cost basis and thus more of the payment is taxed annuity with period certainedit this type of immediate annuity pays the annuitant for a designated number of years ie a period certain and is used to fund a need that will end when the period is up for example it might be used to fund the premiums for a term life insurance policy thus the person may outlive the number of years the annuity will pay life annuityedit main article life annuity a life or lifetime immediate annuity is used to provide an income for the life of the annuitant similar to a defined benefit or pension plan a life annuity works somewhat like a loan that is made by the purchaser contract owner to the issuing insurance company which pays back the original capital or principal which isnt taxed with interest andor gains which is taxed as ordinary income to the annuitant on whose life the annuity is based the assumed period of the loan is based on the life expectancy of the annuitant in order to guarantee that the income continues for life the insurance company relies on a concept called crosssubsidy or the law of large numbers because an annuity population can be expected to have a distribution of lifespans around the populations mean average age those dying earlier will give up income to support those living longer whose money would otherwise run out thus it is a form of longevity insurance see also below a life annuity ideally can reduce the problem faced by a person when they dont know how long they will live and so they dont know the optimal speed at which to spend their savings life annuities with payments indexed to the consumer price index might be an acceptable solution to this problem but there is only a thin market for them in north america life annuity variantsedit for an additional expense either by way of an increase in payments premium or a decrease in benefits an annuity or benefit rider can be purchased on another life such as a spouse family member or friend for the duration of whose life the annuity is wholly or partly guaranteed for example it is common to buy an annuity which will continue to pay out to the spouse of the annuitant after death for so long as the spouse survives the annuity paid to the spouse is called a reversionary annuity or survivorship annuity however if the annuitant is in good health it may be more advantageous to select the higher payout option on his or her life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor the pure life annuity can have harsh consequences for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract such a situation called a forfeiture can be mitigated by the addition of a periodcertain feature under which the annuity issuer is required to make annuity payments for at least a certain number of years if the annuitant outlives the specified period certain annuity payments continue until the annuitants death and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain the annuitants estate or beneficiary is entitled to the remaining payments certain the tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller a viable alternative to the lifewithperiodcertain annuity is to purchase a singlepremium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity impairedlife annuities for smokers or those with a particular illness are also available from some insurance companies since the life expectancy is reduced the annual payment to the purchaser is raised life annuities are priced based on the probability of the annuitant surviving to receive the payments longevity insurance is a form of annuity that defers commencement of the payments until very late in life a common longevity contract would be purchased at or before retirement but would not commence payments until  years after retirement if the nominee dies before payments commence there is no payable benefit this drastically reduces the cost of the annuity while still providing protection against outliving ones resources deferred annuityedit the second usage for the term annuity came into being during the s such a contract is more properly referred to as a deferred annuity and is chiefly a vehicle for accumulating savings with a view to eventually distributing them either in the manner of an immediate annuity or as a lumpsum payment all varieties of deferred annuities owned by individuals have one thing in common any increase in account values is not taxed until those gains are withdrawn this is also known as taxdeferred growth a deferred annuity which grows by interest rate earnings alone is called a fixed deferred annuity fa a deferred annuity that permits allocations to stock or bond funds and for which the account value is not guaranteed to stay above the initial amount invested is called a variable annuity va a new category of deferred annuity called the fixed indexed annuity fia emerged in  originally called an equityindexed annuity fixed indexed annuities may have features of both fixed and variable deferred annuities the insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return for eia an investor can still lose money if he or she cancels or surrenders the policy early before a break even period an oversimplified expression of a typical eias rate of return might be that it is equal to a stated participation rate multiplied by a target stock market indexs performance excluding dividends interest rate caps or an administrative fee may be applicable deferred annuities in the united states have the advantage that taxation of all capital gains and ordinary income is deferred until withdrawn in theory such taxdeferred compounding allows more money to be put to work while the savings are accumulating leading to higher returns a disadvantage however is that when amounts held under a deferred annuity are withdrawn or inherited the interestgains are immediately taxed as ordinary income featuresedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message a variety of features and guarantees have been developed by insurance companies in order to make annuity products more attractive these include death and living benefit options extra credit options account guarantees spousal continuation benefits reduced contingent deferred sales charges or surrender charges and various combinations thereof each feature or benefit added to a contract will typically be accompanied by an additional expense either directly billed to client or indirectly inside product deferred annuities are usually divided into two different kinds fixed annuities offer some sort of guaranteed rate of return over the life of the contract in general such contracts are often positioned to be somewhat like bank cds and offer a rate of return competitive with those of cds of similar time frames many fixed annuities however do not have a fixed rate of return over the life of the contract offering instead a guaranteed minimum rate and a first year introductory rate the rate after the first year is often an amount that may be set at the insurance companys discretion subject however to the minimum amount typically  there are usually some provisions in the contract to allow a percentage of the interest andor principal to be withdrawn early and without penalty usually the interest earned in a month period or  unlike most cds fixed annuities normally become fully liquid depending on the surrender schedule or upon the owners death most equity index annuities are properly categorized as fixed annuities and their performance is typically tied to a stock market index usually the sp  or the dow jones industrial average these products are guaranteed but are not as easy to understand as standard fixed annuities as there are usually caps spreads margins and crediting methods that can reduce returns these products also dont pay any of the participating market indices dividends the tradeoff is that contract holder can never earn less than  in a negative year variable annuities allow money to be invested in insurance company separate accounts which are sometimes referred to as subaccounts and in any case are functionally similar to mutual funds in a taxdeferred manner their primary use is to allow an investor to engage in taxdeferred investing for retirement in amounts greater than permitted by individual retirement or k plans in addition many variable annuity contracts offer a guaranteed minimum rate of return either for a future withdrawal andor in the case of the owners death even if the underlying separate account investments perform poorly this can be attractive to people uncomfortable investing in the equity markets without the guarantees of course an investor will pay for each benefit provided by a variable annuity since insurance companies must charge a premium to cover the insurance guarantees of such benefits variable annuities are regulated both by the individual states as insurance products and by the securities and exchange commission as securities under the federal securities laws the sec requires that all of the charges under variable annuities be described in great detail in the prospectus that is offered to each variable annuity customer of course potential customers should review these charges carefully just as one would in purchasing mutual fund shares people who sell variable annuities are usually regulated by finra whose rules of conduct require a careful analysis of the suitability of variable annuities and other securities products to those to whom they recommend such products these products are often criticized as being sold to the wrong persons who could have done better investing in a more suitable alternative since the commissions paid under this product are often high relative to other investment products there are several types of performance guarantees and one may often choose them à la carte with higher risk charges for guarantees that are riskier for the insurance companies the first type is a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb which can be received only if the owner of the annuity contract or the covered annuitant dies gmdbs come in various flavors in order of increasing risk to the insurance company return of premium a guarantee that you will not have a negative return rollup of premium at a particular rate a guarantee that you will achieve a minimum rate of return greater than  maximum anniversary value looks back at account value on the anniversaries and guarantees you will get at least as much as the highest values upon death greater of maximum anniversary value or particular rollup insurance companies provide even greater insurance coverage on guaranteed living benefits which tend to be elective unlike death benefits which the contractholder generally cannot time living benefits pose significant risk for insurance companies as contractholders will likely exercise these benefits when they are worth the most annuities with guaranteed living benefits glbs tend to have high fees commensurate with the additional risks underwritten by the issuing insurer some glb examples in no particular order guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib a guarantee that one will get a minimum income stream upon annuitization at a particular point in the future guaranteed minimum accumulation lbenefit gmab a guarantee that the account value will be at a certain amount at a certain point in the future guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb a guarantee similar to the income benefit but one that doesnt require annuitizing guaranteedforlife income benefit a guarantee similar to a withdrawal benefit where withdrawals begin and continue until cash value becomes zero withdrawals stop when cash value is zero and then annuitization occurs on the guaranteed benefit amount for a payment amount that is not determined until annuitization date recently insurance companies developed assettransfer programs that operate at the contract level or the fund level in the former a percentage of clients account value will be transferred to a designated lowrisk fund when the contract has poor investment performance on the fund level certain investment options have a target volatility built within the fund usually about  and will rebalance to maintain that target in both cases they are stated to help buffer poor investment performance until markets perform better where they will transition back to normal allocations to catch an upswing however there are criticisms of these programs including but not limited to often mandating these programs on clients restricting flexibility of investing and not catching the upswing of markets fast enough due to the underlying design of such programs be careful in regard to using glb riders in nonqualified contracts as most of the products in the annuity marketplace today create a  taxable income benefit whereas income generated from an immediate annuity in a nonqualified contract would partially be a return of principal and therefore nontaxable criticisms of deferred annuitiesedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message some annuities do not have any deferred surrender charges and do not pay the financial professional a commission although the financial professional may charge a fee for his or her advice these contracts are called noload variable annuity products and are usually available from a feebased financial planner or directly from a noload mutual fund company of course various charges are still imposed on these contracts but they are less than those sold by commissioned brokers it is important that potential purchasers of annuities mutual funds taxexempt municipal bonds commodities futures interest rate swaps in short any financial instrument understand the fees on the product and the fees a financial planner may charge variable annuities are controversial because many believe the extra fees ie the fees above and beyond those charged for similar retail mutual funds that offer no principal protection or guarantees of any kind may reduce the rate of return compared to what the investor could make by investing directly in similar investments outside of the variable annuity a big selling point for variable annuities is the guarantees many have such as the guarantee that the customer will not lose his or her principal critics say that these guarantees are not necessary because over the long term the market has always been positive while others say that with the uncertainty of the financial markets many investors simply will not invest without guaranteeswho past returns are no guarantee of future performance of course and different investors have different risk tolerances different investment horizons different family situations and so on the sale of any security product should involve a careful analysis of the suitability of the product for a given individual taxationedit in the us internal revenue code the growth of the annuity value during the accumulation phase is taxdeferred that is not subject to current income tax for annuities owned by individuals the tax deferred status of deferred annuities has led to their common usage in the united states under the us tax code the benefits from annuity contracts do not always have to be taken in the form of a fixed stream of payments annuitization and many annuity contracts are bought primarily for the tax benefits rather than to receive a fixed stream of income if an annuity is used in a qualified pension plan or an ira funding vehicle then  of the annuity payment is taxable as current income upon distribution because the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the annuity it should be noted this is the same tax treatment of direct participation in a qualified pension plan such as a k again due to the fact the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the plan if the annuity contract is purchased with aftertax dollars then the contract holder upon annuitization recovers his basis prorata in the ratio of basis divided by the expected value according to the tax regulation section  this is commonly referred to as the exclusion ratio after the taxpayer has recovered all of his basis then  of the payments thereafter are subject to ordinary income tax since the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  the use of variable annuities as a tax shelter has greatly diminished because the growth of mutual funds and now most of the dividends of the fund are taxed at long term capital gains rates this taxation contrasted with the taxation of all the growth of variable annuities at income rates means that in most cases variable annuities shouldnt be used for tax shelters unless very long holding periods apply for example more than  years insurance company default risk and state guaranty associationsedit main article guaranty association an investor should consider the financial strength of the insurance company that writes annuity contracts major insolvencies have occurred at least  times since the conspicuous collapse of the executive life insurance company in  insurance company defaults are governed by state law the laws are however broadly similar in most states annuity contracts are protected against insurance company insolvency up to a specific dollar limit often  but as high as  in new york  new jersey  and the state of washington  california is the only state that has a limit less than  the limit is  up to  this protection is not insurance and is not provided by a government agency it is provided by an entity called the state guaranty association when an insolvency occurs the guaranty association steps in to protect annuity holders and decides what to do on a casebycase basis sometimes the contracts will be taken over and fulfilled by a solvent insurance company the state guaranty association is not a government agency but states usually require insurance companies to belong to it as a condition of being licensed to do business the guaranty associations of the fifty states are members of a national umbrella association the national organization of life and health insurance guaranty associations nolhga the nolhga website provides a description of the organization links to websites for the individual state organizations and links to the actual text of the governing state laws a difference between guaranty association protection and the protection of bank accounts by the fdic credit union accounts by the ncua and brokerage accounts by the sipc is that it is difficult for consumers to learn about this protection usually state law prohibits insurance agents and companies from using the guaranty association in any advertising and agents are prohibited

have become a part of the retirement and investment plans of many americans before you buy a variable annuity you should know some of the basics – and be prepared to ask your insurance agent broker financial planner or other financial professional lots of questions about whether a variable annuity is right for you this is a general description of variable annuities – what they are how they work and the charges you will pay before buying any variable annuity however you should find out about the particular annuity you are considering request a prospectus from the insurance company or from your financial professional and read it carefully the prospectus contains important information about the annuity contract including fees and charges investment options death benefits and annuity payout options you should compare the benefits and costs of the annuity to other variable annuities and to other types of investments such as mutual funds contents     what is a variable annuity     how variable annuities work     the death benefit and other features     variable annuity charges     taxfree  exchanges     bonus credits     ask questions before you invest     for more information what is a variable annuity  a variable annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company under which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you beginning either immediately or at some future date you purchase a variable annuity contract by making either a single purchase payment or a series of purchase payments a variable annuity offers a range of investment options the value of your investment as a variable annuity owner will vary depending on the performance of the investment options you choose the investment options for a variable annuity are typically mutual funds that invest in stocks bonds money market instruments or some combination of the three although variable annuities are typically invested in mutual funds variable annuities differ from mutual funds in several important ways first variable annuities let you receive periodic payments for the rest of your life or the life of your spouse or any other person you designate this feature offers protection against the possibility that after you retire you will outlive your assets second variable annuities have a death benefit if you die before the insurer has started making payments to you your beneficiary is guaranteed to receive a specified amount – typically at least the amount of your purchase payments your beneficiary will get a benefit from this feature if at the time of your death your account value is less than the guaranteed amount third variable annuities are taxdeferred that means you pay no taxes on the income and investment gains from your annuity until you withdraw your money you may also transfer your money from one investment option to another within a variable annuity without paying tax at the time of the transfer when you take your money out of a variable annuity however you will be taxed on the earnings at ordinary income tax rates rather than lower capital gains rates in general the benefits of tax deferral will outweigh the costs of a variable annuity only if you hold it as a longterm investment to meet retirement and other longrange goals caution other investment vehicles such as iras and employersponsored k plans also may provide you with taxdeferred growth and other tax advantages for most investors it will be advantageous to make the maximum allowable contributions to iras and k plans before investing in a variable annuity in addition if you are investing in a variable annuity through a taxadvantaged retirement plan such as a k plan or ira you will get no additional tax advantage from the variable annuity under these circumstances consider buying a variable annuity only if it makes sense because of the annuitys other features such as lifetime income payments and death benefit protection the tax rules that apply to variable annuities can be complicated – before investing you may want to consult a tax adviser about the tax consequences to you of investing in a variable annuity remember  variable annuities are designed to be longterm investments to meet retirement and other longrange goals variable annuities are not suitable for meeting shortterm goals because substantial taxes and insurance company charges may apply if you withdraw your money early variable annuities also involve investment risks just as mutual funds do how variable annuities work  a variable annuity has two phases an accumulation phase and a payout phase during the accumulation phase you make purchase payments which you can allocate to a number of investment options for example you could designate  of your purchase payments to a bond fund  to a us stock fund and  to an international stock fund the money you have allocated to each mutual fund investment option will increase or decrease over time depending on the funds performance in addition variable annuities often allow you to allocate part of your purchase payments to a fixed account a fixed account unlike a mutual fund pays a fixed rate of interest the insurance company may reset this interest rate periodically but it will usually provide a guaranteed minimum eg  per year example  you purchase a variable annuity with an initial purchase payment of  you allocate  of that purchase payment  to a bond fund and   to a stock fund over the following year the stock fund has a  return and the bond fund has a  return at the end of the year your account has a value of   in the stock fund and  in the bond fund minus fees and charges discussed below your most important source of information about a variable annuitys investment options is the prospectus request the prospectuses for the mutual fund investment options read them carefully before you allocate your purchase payments among the investment options offered you should consider a variety of factors with respect to each fund option including the funds investment objectives and policies management fees and other expenses that the fund charges the risks and volatility of the fund and whether the fund contributes to the diversification of your overall investment portfolio the secs online publication mutual fund investing look at more than a funds past performance provides information about these factors another sec online publication mutual funds and etfs – a guide for investors provides general information about the types of mutual funds and the expenses they charge during the accumulation phase you can typically transfer your money from one investment option to another without paying tax on your investment income and gains although you may be charged by the insurance company for transfers however if you withdraw money from your account during the early years of the accumulation phase you may have to pay surrender charges which are discussed below in addition you may have to pay a  federal tax penalty if you withdraw money before the age of ½ at the beginning of the payout phase you may receive your purchase payments plus investment income and gains if any as a lumpsum payment or you may choose to receive them as a stream of payments at regular intervals generally monthly if you choose to receive a stream of payments you may have a number of choices of how long the payments will last under most annuity contracts you can choose to have your annuity payments last for a period that you set such as  years or for an indefinite period such as your lifetime or the lifetime of you and your spouse or other beneficiary during the payout phase your annuity contract may permit you to choose between receiving payments that are fixed in amount or payments that vary based on the performance of mutual fund investment options the amount of each periodic payment will depend in part on the time period that you select for receiving payments be aware that some annuities do not allow you to withdraw money from your account once you have started receiving regular annuity payments in addition some annuity contracts are structured as immediate annuities which means that there is no accumulation phase and you will start receiving annuity payments right after you purchase the annuity   the death benefit and other features  a common feature of variable annuities is the death benefit if you die a person you select as a beneficiary such as your spouse or child will receive the greater of i all the money in your account or ii some guaranteed minimum such as all purchase payments minus prior withdrawals example you own a variable annuity that offers a death benefit equal to the greater of account value or total purchase payments minus withdrawals you have made purchase payments totaling  in addition you have withdrawn  from your account because of these withdrawals and investment losses your account value is currently  if you die your designated beneficiary will receive  the  in purchase payments you put in minus  in withdrawals some variable annuities allow you to choose a  steppedup death benefit under this feature your guaranteed minimum death benefit may be based on a greater amount than purchase payments minus withdrawals for example the guaranteed minimum might be your account value as of a specified date which may be greater than purchase payments minus withdrawals if the underlying investment options have performed well the purpose of a steppedup death benefit is to lock in your investment performance and prevent a later decline in the value of your account from eroding the amount that you expect to leave to your heirs this feature carries a charge however which will reduce your account value variable annuities sometimes offer other optional features which also have extra charges one common feature the  guaranteed minimum income benefit guarantees a particular minimum level of annuity payments even if you do not have enough money in your account perhaps because of investment losses to support that level of payments  other features may include longterm care insurance which pays for home health care or nursing home care if you become seriously ill you may want to consider the financial strength of the insurance company that sponsors any variable annuity you are considering buying this can affect the companys ability to pay any benefits that are greater than the value of your account in mutual fund investment options such as a death benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit longterm care benefit or amounts you have allocated to a fixed account investment option caution you will pay for each benefit provided by your variable annuity be sure you understand the charges carefully consider whether you need the benefit if you do consider whether you can buy the benefit more cheaply as part of the variable annuity or separately eg through a longterm care insurance policy variable annuity charges  you will pay several charges when you invest in a variable annuity be sure you understand all the charges before you invest these charges will reduce the value of your account and the return on your investment often they will include the following surrender charges – if you withdraw money from a variable annuity within a certain period after a purchase payment typically within six to eight years but sometimes as long as ten years the insurance company usually will assess a surrender charge which is a type of sales charge this charge is used to pay your financial professional a commission for selling the variable annuity to you generally the surrender charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn and declines gradually over a period of several years known as the surrender period for example a  charge might apply in the first year after a purchase payment  in the second year  in the third year and so on until the eighth year when the surrender charge no longer applies often contracts will allow you to withdraw part of your account value each year –  or  of your account value for example – without paying a surrender charge example you purchase a variable annuity contract with a  purchase payment the contract has a schedule of surrender charges beginning with a  charge in the first year and declining by  each year in addition you are allowed to withdraw  of your contract value each year free of surrender charges in the first year you decide to withdraw  or onehalf of your contract value of  assuming that your contract value has not increased or decreased because of investment performance in this case you could withdraw   of contract value free of surrender charges but you would pay a surrender charge of  or  on the other  withdrawn mortality and expense risk charge – this charge is equal to a certain percentage of your account value typically in the range of  per year this charge compensates the insurance company for insurance risks it assumes under the annuity contract profit from the mortality and expense risk charge is sometimes used to pay the insurers costs of selling the variable annuity such as a commission paid to your financial professional for selling the variable annuity to you example your variable annuity has a mortality and expense risk charge at an annual rate of  of account value your average account value during the year is  so you will pay  in mortality and expense risk charges that year administrative fees – the insurer may deduct charges to cover recordkeeping and other administrative expenses this may be charged as a flat account maintenance fee perhaps  or  per year or as a percentage of your account value typically in the range of  per year example your variable annuity charges administrative fees at an annual rate of  of account value your average account value during the year is  you will pay  in administrative fees underlying fund expenses – you will also indirectly pay the fees and expenses imposed by the mutual funds that are the underlying investment options for your variable annuity fees and charges for other features – special features offered by some variable annuities such as a steppedup death benefit a guaranteed minimum income benefit or longterm care insurance often carry additional fees and charges other charges such as initial sales loads or fees for transferring part of your account from one investment option to another may also apply you should ask your financial professional to explain to you all charges that may apply you can also find a description of the charges in the prospectus for any variable annuity that you are considering taxfree “” exchanges  section  of the us tax code allows you to exchange an existing variable annuity contract for a new annuity contract without paying any tax on the income and investment gains in your current variable annuity account these taxfree exchanges known as  exchanges can be useful if another annuity has features that you prefer such as a larger death benefit different annuity payout options or a wider selection of investment choices you may however be required to pay surrender charges on the old annuity if you are still in the surrender charge period in addition a new surrender charge period generally begins when you exchange into the new annuity this means that for a significant number of years as many as  years you typically will have to pay a surrender charge which can be as high as  of your purchase payments if you withdraw funds from the new annuity further the new annuity may have higher annual fees and charges than the old annuity which will reduce your returns caution if you are thinking about a  exchange you should compare both annuities carefully unless you plan to hold the new annuity for a significant amount of time you may be better off keeping the old annuity because the new annuity typically will impose a new surrender charge period also if you decide to do a  exchange you should talk to your financial professional or tax adviser to make sure the exchange will be taxfree if you surrender the old annuity for cash and then buy a new annuity you will have to pay tax on the surrender bonus credits  some insurance companies are now offering variable annuity contracts with bonus credit features these contracts promise to add a bonus to your contract value based on a specified percentage typically ranging from  to  of purchase payments example  you purchase a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit of  on each purchase payment you make a purchase payment of  the insurance company issuing the contract adds a bonus of  to your account caution variable annuities with bonus credits may carry a downside however – higher expenses that can outweigh the benefit of the bonus credit offered frequently insurers will charge you for bonus credits in one or more of the following ways higher surrender charges – surrender charges may be higher for a variable annuity that pays you a bonus credit than for a similar contract with no bonus credit longer surrender periods – your purchase payments may be subject to surrender charges for a longer period than they would be under a similar contract with no bonus credit higher mortality and expense risk charges and other charges – higher annual mortality and expense risk charges may be deducted for a variable annuity that pays you a bonus credit although the difference may seem small over time it can add up in addition some contracts may impose a separate fee specifically to pay for the bonus credit before purchasing a variable annuity with a bonus credit ask yourself – and the financial professional who is trying to sell you the contract – whether the bonus is worth more to you than any increased charges you will pay for the bonus this may depend on a variety of factors including the amount of the bonus credit and the increased charges how long you hold your annuity contract and the return on the underlying investments you also need to consider the other features of the annuity to determine whether it is a good investment for you example  you make purchase payments of  in annuity a and  in annuity b annuity a offers a bonus credit of  on your purchase payment and deducts annual charges totaling  annuity b has no bonus credit and deducts annual charges totaling  lets assume that both annuities have an annual rate of return prior to expenses of  by the tenth year your account value in annuity a will have grown to  but your account value in annuity b will have grown more to  because annuity b deducts lower annual charges even though it does not offer a bonus you should also note that a bonus may only apply to your initial premium payment or to premium payments you make within the first year of the annuity contract further under some annuity contracts the insurer will take back all bonus payments made to you within the prior year or some other specified period if you make a withdrawal if a death benefit is paid to your beneficiaries upon your death or in other circumstances caution if you already own a variable annuity and are thinking of exchanging it for a different annuity with a bonus feature you should be careful even if the surrender period on your current annuity contract has expired a new surrender period generally will begin when you exchange that contract for a new one this means that by exchanging your contract you will forfeit your ability to withdraw money from your account without incurring substantial surrender charges and as described above the schedule of surrender charges and other fees may be higher on the variable annuity with the bonus credit than they were on the annuity that you exchanged example  you currently hold a variable annuity with an account value of  which is no longer subject to surrender charges you exchange that annuity for a new variable annuity which pays a  bonus credit and has a surrender charge period of eight years with surrender charges beginning at  of purchase payments in the first year your account value in this new variable annuity is now  during the first year you hold the new annuity you decide to withdraw all of your account value because of an emergency situation assuming that your account value has not increased or decreased because of investment performance you will receive  minus  of your  purchase payment or  this is  less than you would have received if you had stayed in the original variable annuity where you were no longer subject to surrender charges in short   take a hard look at bonus credits in some cases the bonus may not be in your best interest ask questions before you invest  financial professionals who sell variable annuities have a duty to advise you as to whether the product they are trying to sell is suitable to your particular investment needs dont be afraid to ask them questions and write down their answers so there wont be any confusion later as to what was said variable annuity contracts typically have a free look period of ten or more days during which you can terminate the contract without paying any surrender charges and get back your purchase payments which may be adjusted to reflect charges and the performance of your investment you can continue to ask questions in this period to make sure you understand your variable annuity before the free look period ends before you decide to buy a variable annuity consider the following questions   will you use the variable annuity primarily to save for retirement or a similar longterm goal   are you investing in the variable annuity through a retirement plan or ira which would mean that you are not receiving any additional taxdeferral benefit from the variable annuity   are you willing to take the risk that your account value may decrease if the underlying mutual fund investment options perform badly   do you understand the features of the variable annuity   do you understand all of the fees and expenses that the variable annuity charges   do you intend to remain in the variable annuity long enough to avoid paying any surrender charges if you have to withdraw money   if a variable annuity offers a bonus credit will the bonus outweigh any higher fees and charges that the product may charge   are there features of the variable annuity such as longterm care insurance that you could purchase more cheaply separately   have you consulted with a tax adviser and considered all the tax consequences of purchasing an annuity including the effect of annuity payments on your tax status in retirement   if you are exchanging one annuity for another one do the benefits of the exchange outweigh the costs such as any surrender charges you will have to pay if you withdraw your money before the end of the surrender charge period for the new annuity remember   before purchasing a variable annuity you owe it to yourself to learn as much as possible
