processing companies in europe specifically in germany we face competition from both sofort gmbh and giropay solutions gmbh we also face competition from paypal our primary competitor is sofort and they offer a nearly identical service that we intend on offering however we intend on providing the service at reduced costs in the hopes that merchants will prefer our service we also face competition from giropay solutions which has a minimal market share of online payment transactions compared to sofort gmbh and is only able to process transactions through a smaller percentage of banks in germany we also face competition from paypal in europe in europe financial institutions remain the primary providers of merchant acquiring payment services to merchants although the outsourcing of these services to thirdparty service providers is becoming more prevalent merchant acquiring payment services have become increasingly complex requiring significant capital commitments to develop maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at competitive prices company description gh capital inc a florida corporation has developed an online payment

evolution of retail opened up a lot of opportunities in this arena and payment services industry is in the midst of growth however the geographic balance is different europe favors the online banking electronic services as compared to other alternatives credit cards only make up  of the transactions in german ecommerce market ideal is among the leading provider in netherlands with sofort gmbh leads in germany and europe but investors cant get a piece of action as both of these are private companieswarning gurufocus has detected  warning sign with amzn click here to check it out ghhc year financial datathe intrinsic value of ghhcpeter lynch chart of ghhcgh capital inc ghhc is one of the companies involved in providing the online banking electronic payment obep services which can be accessed through otc markets the company is taking on the likes of ideal and sofort gmbh the bull case for gh capital was discussed in detail previously heres the summary of why gh capital is a good opportunityfirst the company is focusing on the european market with its online baking electronic payment services online banking payments are supported by banks as they try to wardoff alternative competition gh capital can create problems for its competitors through its unique pricing strategy despite widely accepted volume based pricing model gh capital has adopted a stepped fixed model which allows merchants to scale at lower costs as switching costs are almost none for the consumer and merchants see no harm in integrating cheaper solutions this pricing model creates problem for big players like ideal and sofort gmbhreasons for potential takeoverbig corporations are usually reluctant to slash prices in order to protect margin they usually ignore small competition until it becomes a theat and the safest course of action is to acquire a small company that has potential of gaining market share this seems to be the case for gh capital inc the company supports only around  merchants as of now but its planning to hit a  target by  a low number of merchants dont hurt competitors but this is changing more visibility across merchantsfixed pricing and low switching costs is attracting merchants to sign up for gh capitals clickdirectpay cdp solution according to recent reports gh capital is in talks with a leading online payment provision aggregator allied wallet to make cdp available through their platform the deal will make cdp visible across europe including germany it is worth mentioning that allied wallet a leading provider of online payment processing offering various payment solutions in  countries has seen largescale trending growth in ecommerce transactions and a spike in new merchants by accepting alternative payment methods in germany inclusion of gh capitals cdp in allied wallets portfolio will solve the merchant visibility problem for the cdp this is one of the primary reasons competitors will seriously think about making a bid for the subsidiary of gh capital partnership with hyper scale retailersfurther the management is in talks with one of the largest retailers in germany to integrate cdp with their payment systems being able to secure a deal with a large retailer also puts a question mark on competitors market share the deal if finalized will strengthen potential acquisition prospects for cdp note that gh capital also competes in the high risk merchant space where mainstream service providers like paypal pypl have no presencebottom linethe point is that increasing merchant exposure and a few big merchant inclusions will force some of the large competitors to bid for cdp cutting competition on prices isnt a choice as it affects margin and gh capitals management believe that competitors are unable to slash prices therefore it is probable that cdp will gain material market share if competitors dont revisit their pricing modelfrom an investors perspective its a winwin in case of a takeover a hefty gain is in the cards as takeover bids for otc companies are materially above the trading market price without a takeover cdp has the potential to gain market share amid stepped fixed pricing and european exposure
