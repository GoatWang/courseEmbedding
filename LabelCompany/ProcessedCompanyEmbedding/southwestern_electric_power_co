the map in figure  swepco is headquartered in shreveport its principal business address and telephone number are southwestern electric power company travis streetshreveport louisiana phone  the companys service area is industrially diversified with the chemical petroleum refining primary metals and paper industries the predominant users economic growth in swepcos service area has been minimal in recent years and so has the growth in the companys electricity sales however  electricity sales were  higher than in  with only a  increase in customers the extremely hot summer of  undoubtedly contributed to the increase swepcos  electricity sales by customer sector as a percentage of total sales of  million kwh were  residential  commercial  industrial and  other in  the fuel sources for power generated by swepcos plants located in its threestate service area were  natural gas  coal and  lignite the companys  system peak demand occurred on august  and was  mw up  from

in a widely diversified area covering  square miles in arkansas louisiana oklahoma and texas this area is one of the largest served by any electric utility system in the nation csws business segments are similar to those of entergy in that they also include gas operations and nonutility energy businesses its business plan to improve and expand its core electric utility business and pursue unregulated power projects in other states and outside the us is also similar to entergys business plan at the present time csw is confining its foreign ventures to mexico where it has done business since  the company recently opened an office in mexico city it is presently attempting to acquire the bankrupt el paso electric company whose service area is contiguous to two of csws utility subsidiaries and the mexican border however more than  parties have filed motions with ferc to intervene in the merger like entergy csw does not intend to get into businesses unrelated to energy additional information on csw may be obtained as follows central and south west corporationshareholder services departmentpo box  dallas texas phone  electric generating facilities swepco operates and either owns or has an interest in nine generating facilities located within its three state service area with total  net generating capability of  mw swepcos share the company operates eight of the nine facilities it is the sole owner of six of them and partially owns the other three according to primary fuel source the swepco system generating capability is  natural gas  coal and   lignite swepcos total louisiana generating capability is  mw this is  of the total swepco system capability according to primary fuel source the louisiana capability is  natural gas and  lignite the company solely owns two louisiana gasfired plants the  mw arsenal hill plant and the  mw lieberman plant and has a  interest in the  mw dolet hills lignite fired plant operated by cleco the  generating capability of each of these generating stations according to plant owner and primary fuel type is listed in table  the location of each plant is plotted on the map in figure  swepcos louisiana generating capability is  of the total capability of the ious louisiana plants  of the total capability of the states utilities and  of the total capability of all generating sources within the state in  the  million kwh generated by the two louisiana plants operated by swepco was almost  of the power generated by the ious louisiana plants this output was slightly above  of the total produced by the states utilities and a little more than  of all power produced in louisiana this is far below the capability of these two gasfired plants but since the companys lignitefueled plants are its lowest cost source of generation they will be fully utilized before a gasfired plant will be put on line the  net generation of each louisiana generating station according to plant operator and fuel type is listed in table  swepco bums lowsulfur coal and lignite in its solidfuel plants or operates with pollution control equipment so its plants are in compliance with limits set by the caaa recent developments in  swepco completed its purchase of the bossier electric membership corporation bremco a distribution cooperative which was adjacent to the companys louisiana service territory bremco served  customers in a service area covering  square miles in  swepco and another csw utility subsidiary filed tariffs with the ferc under which the two utilities will generally make available firm and nonfirm transmission services for other electric utilities on the combined utilitiestransmission systems in the southwest power pool as part of csws restructuring effort to stay competitive in march  swepco announced a reduction in its workforce of up to  jobs which is about an  reduction the cuts are to be made either through attrition or early retirement programs swepco is presently seeking to provide wholesale power to the city of minden which is considering proposals from several potential suppliers history  the original southwestern gas and electric company was the product of a merger of three utilitiesshreveport gas electric light and power company caddo gas and oil company and texarkana gas and electric company these utilities were owned by three brothersrufus henry and charles dawes on june   the brothers consolidated their holdings into one company and southwestern was born at the time of its formation the company served only three communities shreveport bossier city and texarkanawith a combined population of only  the dawes retained control of southwestern until  when it was sold to middle west utilities one of the largest groups of utility properties in the us at the time the largest of middle wests many holding companies was central and south west southwestern became a part of csw although the depression hit four years later southwestern prospered because at the same time one of the largest oil fields in the country was discovered in company territory near henderson texas so while most of the industry was struggling to stay alive southwestern was doing all it could to construct new lines to serve the fledgling oil and gas industry the company essentially got out of the gas business in  with the sale of its gulf cities division in mississippi but through the s and early s southwestern was still involved in ice water and streetcars for a while sales of ice ranked second only to electricity however by the mids all gas ice water and transportation activities were divested with southwestern now solely in the electric business and with its service territory expanding rapidly attention turned to building new power plants the companys three original plants were inadequate to meet the need for electricity that occurred after world war ii as consumers gobbled up energyusing appliances on a mass scale four plants were built between  and  after they were built most of these plants added additional generating units as they were needed in  after  years as southwestern gas and electric company a new corporate name was adoptedsouthwestern electric power company the new name more accurately identified the companys operations encouraged by the availability of inexpensive and cleanburning natural gas in the s swepco like many utilities satisfied the need for new capacity by building gasfired generating plants the wilkes plant was completed in  and additional units were added in  and  but by the early s natural gas shortages developed the price escalated sharply and longterm contracts could not be obtained so the search for other generating fuels began swepco first chose coal and built two coalfired plants that went online in the late s welsh in east texas and flint creek in northwest arkansas later the company began studying the feasibility of using lignite which was abundantly available in swepcos own service area while lignite has a much lower heating value than coal its great advantage over coal is that its transportation cost is essentially zero when compared to lowsulfur wyoming coal subsequently the company completed the lignitefueled pirkey plant in east texas in  and the dolet hills plant in northwest louisiana in  in partnership with cleco no new generating plant is now under construction and none is expected to be needed for the rest of the decade go to cooperativelyowned electric utilities return to table of contents  energy star award winners  energy star skip to main
