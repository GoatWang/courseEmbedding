trading about  early last week near its week high of  it closed friday at  down  centsneogenomics earlier this month garnered a  million federal contract from the us department of veterans affairs for medical servicesit announced in june an expansion of its immuneoncology profiling test menu the move reflects recent advances in immunotherapy — the prevention or treatment of disease with substances that stimulate the immune responseimmunotherapy has changed cancer treatment providing benefits across a range of diseases once considered untreatable and extending the lives of patientsneogenomics also expanded its cancer profiles to include tumor mutation burden a new genomic biomarker it also added microsatellite instability testing in response to the fda’s announcement in may that merck’s keytruda drug was approved for the treatment of patients with certain metastatic solid tumorskeytruda is a cancer medicine that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body“despite the significant success of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies not all patients respond to therapy and there is a need to identify the subset of patients that are more likely to respond” said dr maher albitar senior vice president chief medical officer and director of research and development in a releasemelina gomez an employee of neogenomics signs in specimens photo the newspress file photoan important part of the immune system according to the american cancer society is its ability to tell between normal cells in the body and those it sees as “foreign” this lets the immune system attack the foreign cells while leaving the normal cells alone to do this it uses “checkpoints” — molecules on certain immune cells that need to be activated or inactivated to start an immune responsecancer cells sometimes find ways to use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system but drugs that target these checkpoints hold a lot of promise as cancer treatments“neogenomics provides a broad range of cancer immunoprofiling tests … to more precisely determine which patients are good candidates for immunotherapy” albitar saidadding tests as new drugs and advances come to the market allows neogenomics to stay on the cutting edge of testing services“this timely expansion of our stateoftheart testing services will help physicians better identify which patients will respond to new advanced immunotherapies” said douglas vanoort neogenomics chairman and ceo in a releasevanoort called the fda announcement “a major development in the fight against cancer”“and it aligns well with our extensive menu of tests that examine cancer biomarkers” he said neogenomics in may announced the presentation of results of a new clinical trial demonstrating that the sensitivity of its liquid biopsy prostate test was  percent in predicting the presence of high grade prostate cancer while the sensitivity of conventional biopsies in the study was  percentthe data presented at the american urological association annual meeting indicates that the neogenomics prostate test can be useful in determining which patients should enter into active surveillance programsthe concept of active surveillance according to the prostate cancer foundation has increasingly emerged as a viable option for men who decide not to undergo immediate radical treatmentaccording to the american cancer societys “cancer facts and figures ” about  new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed annually with about  deaths from prostate cancer occurring each yearprostate biopsy testing is commonly used to determine the presence or absence of aggressive prostate cancer however it is well documented that conventional prostate biopsy testing is frequently inaccurate and not representative due to sampling errorslooking ahead neogenomics has its sights set on europe“we expect to open our new geneva switzerland lab facility by the end of quarter  and we are starting to receive client interest for that facility to support european clinical trials” vanoort saidneogenomics pharma services division serves pharmaceutical clients in clinical trials and
