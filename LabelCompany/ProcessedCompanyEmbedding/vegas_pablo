hand but for some reason it didnt hold one of them then dealt me the ace needed for  aces and a kicker meaning i was suppose to get  aces with a kickerthe middle button has been not working properly on this machine for a while sometimes it holds sometimes it doesnt but because it usually only caused me to loose a pair i would normally just let it go as if it happened it would be just a dollar or so lost well because this was a several hundred dollar mistake due to malefaction on the machine as you can imagine i was upset so i tell the cashier they call their gambling dept that runs all their green valley stations gambling machines ill keep all the details short so what end up happening is they came down rolled the machines and saw that i was right had the  ace hold it would have given me the fourth ace with kicker and took full responsibility owned up and paid me my money going through this experience i now know their on top of their game and have complete faith in their business ethics and will continue to gamble there daily as this place runs there stores with good business ethics and above all are honest and fair you can gamble knowing they arent cheating customers or fixing machines to their benefit besides being honest with their machines the manager who works here is also the best manager i have ever seen work at a gas station she runs this place just a business owner would and i would know because my husband and i own business here in vegas the whole staff is friendly and professional long story short i would advise anyone who likes to gamble like me to skip the casinos and other gas stations and gamble here at green valley gas stations besides them being honest the machines pay out decent and often so there not tight like the casinos or other gas stations and their honest they dont cheat you out of your moneynew india marketbrian k ratedthis is such a great store i am so happy i went there when i first arrived in vegas i had gone to the bigger indian store nearby and they had far fewer items and associates who were unwilling to helpthis store may be smaller but it is packed with anything and everything you need for indian cuisine north or south and the man who runs the store is always there and is extremely meticulous in his job duties and customer service he is perhaps the most helpful store associate i have met in vegas he took so much time and care to make sure i found everything that i needed and that all questions were answeredi am really only familiar with tamilnadu and sri lanken cooking so i had a lot of questions for him and he answered every one very thoroughly and was such a kind man he really made my day which hadnt been going very well up until then he talked to me about ingredients and recipe ideas and

m ratedthis is a small chain from texas and the food is good if atypical southwestern style mexican food los cucos cant compete with vegas local powerhouse lindo michoacan but it still has pretty good eats and great servicethe interior is strange a ragtag looking atmosphere in what is obviously a space formerly inhabited by mimis cafe the mardi gras balcony is still there but now theres some sparse randomly placed mexican decor lining the walls the restaurant feels spacious open and clean and theres a particularly nice open bar area right inside the front door the place lacks character but its a pleasant enough atmospherei had to laugh at the menu because its loaded with misspellings crispi tacos romain lettuce and some of the descriptions are exactly the same for different items check out the special fajitas on the menu when i pointed this out to our server she couldnt explain it nor tell me which item it was that was the correct description i eventually got what i wanted but the menu had the dish listed under two different names youd think for a chain restaurant the menu would be consistent and free of spelling errorsas with most mexican eateries the house serves complimentary chips and salsa the chips were good enough but served cold the salsas are delicious like seriously delicious theres a spicy smoky red salsa thats served warm and a fantastic avocado crema style cold salsa both of these were the highlight of my meal and i am still craving them theyll make me return to the restaurant oftenwe ordered the queso with shrimp as an appetizer at  its overpriced the cheese wasnt that warm when it was served and the queso was loaded with red onions mushrooms and other unnecessary stuff the shrimp was seasoned well and quite delicious however i wouldnt order this againfor lunch i ordered chicken fajitas and my husband ordered steak fajitas the meat quality was topnotch i loved the marinade on both of the meats and we both agreed the meat was some of the best in town the fajita vegetables were just okay  onions and poblano peppers i was disappointed in the overall fajitas but id love to have just the meat served on its own i had fajitas that came loaded with bacon and cheese and it was an unusual and very tasty combo the side plate was huge and had soso beans average rice and very tasty guacamole and pico de gallofatty alert they serve homemade flour tortillas and they are delicious i love mexican restaurants that care enough to make legit tortillas and im happy that los cucos does it right i couldve eaten two dozen of them its a bummer that they arent served in tortilla warmers to keep them soft but instead are plopped on the table sandwiched between paper towels this means the tortillas get hard very quickly best to gobble them up as soon as possibleafter our lunch jesus the manager came over to ask how we enjoyed everything he was very eager to please and happy to listen to our suggestions i was very impressed with this personal touch and the efficient friendly service we receivedthis isnt the best mexican food in vegas but the kitchen uses very high quality ingredients the prices on most menu items are fair and the service is goodlindo michoacanwest flamingolouisa m ratedone of the three lindo michoacan locations in las vegas this one can definitely hold its own while not quite as good as its sister locations this is the closest one to me so i eat here often the signature stellar lindo service is here really how do they always manage to give  star service no matter the time of day and the food is deliciousi love the queso here its basically a big plate of real melty cheese baked with charred poblano peppers and served with lindos delicious homemade flour tortillas i love the tortillas here and i frequently eat my weight in them bye bye low carb diet the complimentary chips salsa and bean dip is always a hit too the food here is just delicious you cant go wrong with many of the dishes although sometimes the chicken quality in some of the specialty dishes is a little bit rubbery and off  dont know why but it has happened a couple of times at this location ive never had an issue with the chicken quality in the chicken fajitas or with any of the seafood or beef dishes the guacamole is worth getting and they have yummy diet pepsi and fresh brewed iced tea again the focus is on quality and servicethe prices are higher than your average mexican restaurant but i think its worth it this location runs incredible lunch deals and specials during the week and the kitchen is fast so its the perfect spot for a quick workday lunchthe hostesses will automatically try to seat you in the bar section of the restaurant if you are a party of just adults theres an extra special atmosphere in this area on weeknights when a dude in a sparkly red shirt plays a synthesizer and sings pop songs in broken english its pretty rad and its not too loud which is nice if you are looking for a quieter experience ask to be seated in the other part of the restaurantnote that the parking lot here is deceptive and is often overflowing with cars even if it appears packed do not be discouraged and assume theres a wait  go in anyway ive never had to wait here even on a very busy saturday nightcasa don juan restaurantvalsutter ratedwe were seated quickly with our drinks and chips delivered within minutes after we ordered them all servers were polite and attentive the food was borderline good to excellent portions were large i had the  combination chickentamale with green chile verde beef enchilada beef taco with mexican rice and beans it could have used a little more sauce my husband had a  a chicken  beef fajita with rice  beans the portion was very large with a lot of beef and chicken  both tender and tasty  we would recommend this resturant to everyoneoriginal lindo michoacanjhgf ratedwe drove by this place a couple times and were deterred by the long lines finally kids were up early and we decided to head out and try it food was pretty good in a basic breakfast kinda way nothing fancy or special about the food scrambled eggs are scrambled eggs pancakes plain ol flapjacks the atmosphere was busy and there seemed to be mainly tourists there so this is not surprising great location close to beach but we wouldnt make another special trip out there just to eat the foodoriginal lindo michoacanbacchuss0 ratedthe food here has a distinct lean toward the interior of mexico the flavors are smokey and very complex if you are expecting cheese enchiladas and tacos youll be disappointed but if youre willing to try fish tacos caldo de pollo in a rich red chili broth or chunky guacamole served in a molcajete then this is your place the service is attentive without being obtrusive i didnt get the prix fixe lunch but it did look like a tremendous valueoriginal lindo michoacanlauraa ratedstill one of the best in vegas after all these years this location is so much better than the others for some reason the nopalitos are just great and a hard to find item here we always take visitors there even though we live across town my spouse and i went for dinner tonight and had a very fun experience at lindo michoacan we enjoyed the food the atmosphere and the serviceall very much were defintely planning to go back soonel burrito mexican restauranthotspotguy ratedwow found this gem in las vegasi went in last week and was sat down in this cute spot with lights above meimmediately was greeted and ordered a guacamole and margarita the margarita was so good and strong surprised  i am a margarita expert the guacamole was def hand made i could taste the lime and flavor in each biteowner was nice but quiet said he had been in business for  years why is this not a franchise i dont know will be back every sundayoriginal lindo michoacanmtim ratedive eaten here a few times before and they do have some of the best mexican food in town as im a big fan of day of the dead folk art i enjoyed much of the interior decor they had very good mexican food at reasonable prices table side guacamole is a must have every time ceviche is excellent carnitas excellent combination plates are all good wash it down with a premium margarita great service very attentivehussongs cantinadjbabes ratedwe stopped by on a sunday afternoon and the place was very quiet our server and the kitchen were pretty slow and the food was definitely overpriced we tried the guacamole corn on the cobb vegan enchiladas and soy chicken tacos the guacamole was very small and flavorless the corn was disgusting it was bland and overcookedburnt the free chips and salsa were the best things there the entrees were just okrobertos taco shopleemccann ratedthe food is good but the servthe food is good but the service stinks first you can buy extra hot sauce in a tub next time they can give you some but not sell itnext time they dont give any in a tub nor do they sell any in a tub next time you are only allowed
