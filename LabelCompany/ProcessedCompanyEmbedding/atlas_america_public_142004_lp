limited partnership formed on may   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania and tennessee we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy lp atlas energy for administrative services our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce natural gas and oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through thirdparty gas gathering systems we do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as well tending routine maintenance and adjustment reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of march   our mgp had not withheld any funds for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth information relating to our

prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the

 and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended march   as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a  decrease in production volumes partially offset by an increase of  in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges which were driven by market conditions our production volumes decreased to  mcf per day for the three months ended march   from  mcf per day for the three months ended march   a decrease of  mcf per day  the overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended march   as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well oil revenues we drill wells primarily to produce natural gas rather than oil but some wells have limited oil production our oil revenues were  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively an increase of   the  increase in oil revenues for the three months ended march   as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a  increase in production volumes partially offset by a  decrease in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges our

liquids revenue the majority of our wells produce dry gas which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser some wells however produce wet gas which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons ie natural gas liquids that must be removed prior to transporting the gas once removed these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers our natural gas liquid revenues were  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in natural gas liquid revenues for the three months ended march   as compared to the prior year similar period was attributed to a  decrease in production volumes partially offset by a  increase in our natural gas liquid prices

day  costs and expenses production expenses were  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively a decrease of   this increase was mostly attributable to a decrease in well supervision fees due to wells being temporarily shutin for repairs and maintenance depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively these percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues oil and gas reserve quantities product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   and  were  and  respectively a decrease of   these expenses include thirdparty costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our mgp the decreases for the three months ended march   is primarily due to a decrease in thirdparty costs as compared to the prior year similar period liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities decreased  in the three months ended march   to  as compared to  for the three months ended march   this decrease was due to a decrease in net earnings before depletion net of noncash loss on derivative value and accretion of  a decrease in the change in accounts receivable tradeaffiliate of  and a  decrease in the cost incurred to plug wells partially offset by an increase in the change in accrued liabilities of  for the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   cash provided by investing activities was  and  for the three months ended march   and  due to the sale of tangible equipment cash used in financing activities decreased  during the three months ended march   to  from  for the three months ended march   this decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners our mgp may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs any additional funds if required will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our mgp or its affiliates which are not contractually committed to make loans to us the amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed  of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from thirdparties the partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners historically there has been no need to borrow funds from our mgp to fund operations critical accounting policies the discussion
