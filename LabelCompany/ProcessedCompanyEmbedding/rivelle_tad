johngitt more stories by john gittelsohn september    pm edt credit issuance topped  trillion for five years in a row ‘we’ve lived this story before’ rivelle says in note corporate leverage which has exceeded levels reached before the  financial crisis is a sign that investors should start preparing for the end of the credit cycle according to tcw group inc’s tad rivelle“the creditfuelled expansion inevitably comes to a bad end” rivelle chief investment officer for fixed income at tcw said in a note sent to investors tuesday “we’ve lived this story before”other fixedincome investors such as bill gross and jeffrey gundlach have warned that central bank policies are fueling asset bubbles which will eventually burst triggering financial market turmoil corporate leverage in america

estimate from morgan stanley the ratio fell to  in  when the us economy started recovering from the great recessionrivelle whose firm oversees  billion blames central bankers for fueling asset bubbles which are bound to collapse as leverage goes up faster than income available to service debt“our counsel remains as it has been avoid those assets that will be broken in the coming deleveraging while keeping a ‘steady as she goes’ attitude towards the future purchase of those assets that will merely bend when the flood come” rivelle wroterivelle’s  billion metropolitan west total return bond fund

economics trading secrets here be dragons economics july   tad rivelle capital markets are information engines when functioning properly they reflect what investors know – or think they know – about the future future expectations are for all to see discounted in today’s financial prices obviously this doesn’t mean that capital markets are always “right” for the future comes as it will caring not a whit whether it was the one we ordered up or not for the first time in recorded history financial interest rates have gone negative to say this makes no sense is almost tautological nobody pays to have their amazon delivery delayed or their uber pickup deferred consumption now is always prioritized over consumption later which is why interest rates have been positive for centuries is there some set of future expectations that could possibly justify negative yielding debt government bond yields as of  source bloomberg were an investor to accept that negative yields actually reflect future expectations then the sovereign debt market must be calling for a ‘s style price deflation go long canned green peas and head for the hills yet is there not a fly in the ointment of this analysis stocks hitting record highs obviously do not reflect deflation expectations nor do investment grade corporate bonds yielding  ¾ the risk markets violently disagree with the sovereign debt markets yet how can it be that government bond yields are pathologically low while risk assets are priced atrociously high the occam’s razor answer is this the ecb the boj and yes the fed too have blocked the capital markets from expressing their “unbiased” future expectations rather than let the capital markets reveal investor expectations the central banks have imposed a pricing regime that reflects what the academics believe to be “better” outcomes this is scary if negative rates are merely the latest in a long line of artifices the central banks have resorted to so as to make the risk carry trade profitable then look out below for once the central banks let go of the till or have it pulled from their hands this whole financially engineered dynamic goes careening into reverse without active suppression by the central banks the bond market will call offsides on negative yields and sovereign rates will surely “normalize” back to positive rates but higher government rates will also force cap rates higher everywhere in stocks in realestate and in the real world where businesses calculate a demanded return in exchange for a capital allocation in the mind of the central banker the capital markets must be stopped dead in their tracks whenever they threaten a “tantrum” but in so doing capital markets are prevented from telling us what true market clearing levels are and without good information coordination loses its effectiveness leading to low growth and soggy productivity low growth – the consequence of inefficient resource use – then becomes the recurring justification for still more central bank rate suppression the paradigm is not one of selfcorrection but of doubling down keep doubling down and rather than having a series of corrections you might just end up with a crash monetary central planning has not led to the uncorking of the champagne bottles instead it has engineered a condition of overvalued asset prices now propped up by the absurdity of negative rates the fed et al are riding the tiger of a great global carry trade some have called this the “new normal” but it is anything but normal and it is also inherently unstable how unstable while no one can say for certain two metrics that have had a dispositive record of forecasting recession are  declining corporate profits and  progressively flatter yield curves we have both the gap in gaap earnings source bloomberg tcw  basic eps before extraordinary items excludes the effects of discontinued operations accounting standard changes and natural disasters includes the effects of other onetime gainslosses uses weighted average shares excluding the effects of convertibles flattening treasury curves precede recessions source bloomberg there is really no mystery as to why these metrics matter lower profits force managements to defend their margins by curtailing business investment and by throttling back on hiring the widening chasm between the “adjusted” earnings that companies report versus what their gaap calculated earnings would be is yet another red flag and of course flatter yield curves compress net interest margins making leverage less profitable less leverage means balance sheets shrink which forces a rationing of credit and a tightening of lending standards the writing is on the wall our central bankers took the till away from the markets years ago confident that their policies would chart a course to el dorado instead they have sailed us off the map into places that financial markets have never been and should never be media attachmentstrading secrets

westtcw at the helm of tcw total return met west on the tcw total return takeover tcw total return should you stay or go eric jacobson hi im eric jacobsen with morningstar im the director of fixed income research and im here with tad rivelle tad is the chief investment officer of metropolitan west asset management and as a result of a recent combination of his firm with tcw also in charge of the highgrade bond area at tcw as well tad thanks so much for joining us tad rivelle thank you eric appreciate it thank you jacobson tad let me start with a few questions just about the combination of the firms i know youve been asked some of these things before but for now anywayand you can explain that if necessaryis there any difference in the way that any of the portfolios on either side are being managed in terms of their mandates as a result of your team coming in rivelle our prime directive is to maintain stylistic consistency both with respect to the met west portfolios as well as the tcw portfolios so though the team is now able to draw upon the combined resources of both the tcw half as well as the met west half the management of the portfolios has been very consistent jacobson i know that with some of the changes that happened when you came in here in particular the tcw total return fund its been widely reported had some pretty swift redemptions early on i gather that its tapered off some but the numbers they change from day to day so maybe you can kind of give us an update as to where it stands now relative to day one when that started happening and how you are feeling about managing that read full transcript rivelle the flows have been very manageable as was widely reported in the press the numbers were very large for the first couple of days after the management changes they have tapered off to a very small fraction of that number we were able to maintain a high degree of consistency with respect to the expression of the strategy in that fund as we also reported perhaps twothirds approximately of the tcw total return bond fund was invested in agencymortgage backed securities with the residual the onethird being in nonagency mortgage backed securities so we did have to engage in sales of both agency as well as nonagency mortgages though sales went very smoothly so from our standpoint the flows are very manageable and from the standpoint of being able to maintain the same expression of strategy nothing has been altered jacobson you know theres one issue thats very obvious because of the tcw total return having a history as being a very mortgagefocused fund a lot of questions coming up about your mortgage capabilities and i know that theyre extensive maybe tell us a little bit about the development of those i know that mitch flack and brian whalenmitch being an agency mortgage specialist brian more on the nonagency sideboth came into the firm x number of years ago and my impression certainly is that a lot of capabilities have been built up since then maybe give us a little bit of narrative as to how the decision to make those changes adding them and also the investments that went into the firm to do so give us a little background rivelle yeah ill give a little bit of a background and history of the team and the mortgagebacked market for those that might be a little bit less familiar with the history of met west asset management we represent a team of portfolio managers that actually began our careers at pimco nearly  years ago and our experience with mortgagebacked securities actually began at that shop and then was further developed at another labased firm hotchkis  wiley so the team has been managing agency as well as nonagency mortgages for decades additionally you are quite right the team was significantly augmented in terms of its skill and capabilities with the addition of mitch flack in  he brings with him roughly  years of experience in the mortgagebacked industry i think he knows just about everything there is to know about agency mortgagebacked securities youve spoken with him you probably can confirm that and hes a principal and a cohead of the mortgage desk here at tcw brian whalen is his cohead who focuses more on the nonagency the more creditintensive aspects of the mortgage market he and the various pms and traders and analysts that support him is the tip of the spear from the standpoint of analyzing nonagency mortgagebacked instruments on the desk his background includes having joined met west about six years ago prior to that he was a director at csfb credit suisse first boston and before that at donaldson lufkin  jenrette brian was the individual who was primarily responsible for overseeing our effort as it related to development of proprietary analytics in nonagency mortgagebacked securities most specifically our loan level database that absorbs  million residential mortgage loans from roughly speaking  or so servicers around the country which combine with the existing tcw analytical systems both of which i think have represented a very very considerable capex from the standpoint of both firms it gives us nearly  coverage of all of the residential mortgage loans in the country and therefore a highly detailed granular knowledge of how those loans are priced or should be priced and valued jacobson well i appreciate your time today tad
