first invented in the s most antique barometers found today are those dating back to the th and th centuries these are generally refurbished and sold to collectors a mercury barometer consists of a glass tube that is closed at one end with a mercuryfilled reservoir at the base there are many different styles of antique barometers eg stick wheel or dial that may contain elemental mercury in the glass tube or as an attached thermometer most of these are sealed systems in which no liquid mercury can escape even when the barometer is inverted however some antique barometers do have one end that is open to the atmosphere the exact amount of mercury depends on the style and size of the barometer click image for a larger viewsource ebay antique wheel barometer most antique barometers contain approximately  ounces of mercury which is equivalent to one quarter of a pound however there are some barometers mainly those used in scientific or laboratory settings that have up to  grams of mercury which is equivalent to approximately  pound purpose of the mercury a barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure the level of mercury in the barometer rises or falls with changes in pressure corresponding to a change in the weather pattern nonmercury barometers exist eg aneroid digital and liquid gas silicon that are both accurate and attractive however there is still an interest among collectors in the antique barometers that contain the shiny silvercolored elemental mercury potential hazards the amount of mercury contained in barometers combined with the fact that some may have an opensystem ie one end of the glass tube containing the mercury is open creates a high potential for a mercury release or spill spills greater than one pound of elemental mercury about two tablespoons must be reported to the appropriate state environmental agency persons that have been exposed to a mercury spill should contact the public health department or poison control center recyclingdisposal households are generally exempt from the rcra hazardous waste requirements however because of the amount of mercury in barometers they are prohibited from being disposed of in

some states and municipalities provide this service free of charge while others require a small fee persons should first check with their local municipality to find out about the specific recycling and disposal options including which products are accepted licensed hazardous waste management firms may also collect transport and recycle mercury from the barometers some antique dealers will purchase antique mercury barometers to restore and refurbish and offer them for resale as noted antique barometers are fairly expensive therefore the likelihood that someone would dispose of one by throwing it in regular trash is relatively slim persons should never attempt to drain or replace mercury from a barometer on their own care should be taken when packing barometers for shipment or

delivers the air to the pipes such switches and manometers may contain substantial amounts of mercury purpose of the mercury in most organs the manometer is connected to the bellows this manometer regulates the pressure of air as it is sent from the bellows causing the reeds to vibrate and make a sound the vibrations coming through the individual pipes are blended to create a harmonious sound

start to lose credibility  according to morningstar hussman’s flagship fund hussman strategic growth has generated an annual return of  per year for the past  years  this trails the overall market sp  by  per year during that time period  to put it another way if i had put  into the hussman strategic growth fund ten years ago i’d have  today conversely the same investment in the sp  would be worth  if hussman maintains his bearish stance he’ll be right at some point  as the saying goes a broken clock is right twice a day  the market always goes down  the question is at what cost  missing out on all of the gains we have experienced over the past  years will most likely not make up for his avoidance of future losses  this realization confirms much of our thinking at greenspring  no one can predict the future consistently  managers like hussman sound very convincing but as you look at the data of mutual fund returns it is hard to argue that their success isn’t almost entirely due to luck

i repair or replace a broken appliance – here’s how to decideby amy livingston posted in home improvementshare tweet pincommentslet’s say you make a smoothie for breakfast you load the blender with fruit and yogurt press the “blend” button and…nothing happens broken appliances can be a real drag and are especially common in old homeswhat do you do nextyou could try to get it repaired but you’re not even sure where to find a repair shop these days even if you found one they’re often costly a new blender could cost around  so maybe the repair is still a better deal but how can you be sure the blender won’t just break againdon’t let yourself end up in this situation if you’ve got a broken blender – or a broken anything – sitting around there are a few simple rules that can help you figure out whether to repair it or replace itadvantages of repairingthere are several good reasons to repair things when they break instead of replacing them most important it’s usually cheaper to repair an item it doesn’t make sense to replace a leaky faucet for  if all it needs is a washer that costs less than repairing is also less wasteful than replacing this is especially important when trying to reduce your carbon footprintif you replace the whole faucet not only are you out an extra  you’ve also got an old faucet to dispose that’s a pretty hefty piece of metal to toss in your trash bin if you have to pay for trash pickup throwing out the old faucet will add to your costs – and even if you don’t it’ll take up space in a landfilla new faucet also has environmental costs there’s the damage done by mining the metal that went into it and the energy used to manufacture it and ship it to the store if you replace just the washer you’re using far less material and energyadvantages of replacingreplacing a broken item has its advantages too a brandnew item is likely to be in better shape than your old one if your old faucet is dented or covered in grime you’ve never been able to scrub off a new one will look betterit may work better too replacing the old washer could stop your faucet from dripping for a while but if the faucet is damaged internally the new washer may wear out in a few months so a new faucet could be your best chance of keeping the drips away for good plus if you choose a lowflow faucet the new one could help cut your water billbuying a new faucet also opens up other choices your local home center probably has dozens of different styles and finishes to choose from – traditional and modern chrome and brass singlehandle and doublehandle so if you’ve never really liked the look of the old faucet replacing it gives you a chance to pick a new one that fits your tastelast but not least replacing an item is often less work than repairing it replacing a faucet washer only takes a few minutes – but if that doesn’t fix the drip you could spend hours trying alternative approaches by your third trip to the hardware store buying a new faucet and being done with it starts to look like a pretty attractive optionquestions to askrepairing and replacing both have their perks the problem is figuring out which is the best option this is a complicated question because there are a lot of factors involved no simple rule such as “replace it if it’s over eight years old” is going to cover all of theminstead examine all the factors involved in your particular case the cost of the new item is obviously a big one but also consider the age of the old item the difficulty of the repair and so onyou can work your way through these details by asking yourself some basic questions how hard is it to repairsome fixes you can do yourself for example if a button pops off your shirt all you need to put it back on is a needle and thread and a few minutes simple diy repairs like this are almost always worth doing even if they don’t save you much money it’s very satisfying to see your hands turn something broken into something that workseven things you can’t fix yourself are often easy jobs for a trained professional for instance frugalliving expert jeff yeager writes at aarp that most broken electrical items have fixable problems such as a faulty electrical cord or a wornout belt an electronics repair shop can fix these problems easilyother items can be trickier to fix modern electronic devices often depend on special parts that are expensive to replace this makes replacing complex gadgets simpler and often less expensive than repairing themthere’s also the question of whether you can even find a repair shop decades ago it was possible to find a tv repair person or a shoemaker to resole your shoes nowadays skilled repair artists are fewer and farther between so if you have an item you can’t fix and you can’t find someone else who can repairing isn’t an option at all how do the costs comparesometimes even a complex repair is still worth doing car repairs are a good example a new car is such a big expense that junking your old car every time it needs a repair – even a complicated expensive repair – isn’t an optionby contrast other items are much cheaper to buy – and much more costly to fix if you’ve got a broken smartphone and you don’t know how to fix it yourself replacing it could cost less than taking it to a repair center similarly it isn’t worth paying a tailor to take in an old shirt when you could buy a new one for  at a bigbox storewhen balancing the costs of repairing or replacing an item consumer experts often use a rule called “the  rule” if repairing your old item costs at least half as much as buying a new one you should just go ahead and replace it after all something that’s already broken once could end up breaking again if you have to fix it twice spending half the replacement cost each time you could have just bought a new one for the money you’ve sunk into patching up the old oneif your gadget has already been repaired once the experts at consumer reports say even  may be too much to spend on fixing it again when the same item has broken twice that’s a sign that it isn’t reliable so unless the repair cost is cheap replacing it could be a better bet but if your broken item is still under warranty the repeated repairs aren’t costing you anything so just fix it again and hope for the best how worn out is ithow long will repairing your item will actually extend its life there’s no point in spending money to fix something that needs to be replaced in a few months anywayfor instance if your yearold water heater breaks there’s not much point in trying to fix it according to handymen mcgarry and madsen the average lifespan of a water heater is only  to  years so you’re lucky your old heater has lasted this long the only time it’s worth fixing something that’s already on its last legs is when you can do a quick diy patch job to buy yourself a little time while shopping for a new onehowever even old appliances can be worth repairing if they’re well made older appliances are often more than modern ones if you own one of these old workhorses a simple repair could keep it chugging along for several more yearsthe same goes for any other product that’s built to last for instance say you’ve been wearing the same highquality pair of leather boots for  years and now the soles are worn out as long as the uppers are in good shape it’s probably worth spending  to have them resoledby contrast anything that was cheap to start with probably isn’t worth fixing if your old boots only cost  and they wore out in one year it isn’t worth slapping a pair of  soles on them chances are the uppers will just wear out in another year making it a waste of  is it costing you moneyold appliances often cost more to run than new ones thanks to new efficiency standards modern fridges washers and other appliances use much less energy than old relics from the ’s and ’sfor example according to energy star a refrigerator dating from before  uses more than  worth of electricity each year a new energy star fridge would cost only  a year to run that means the new fridge would save more than  in energy costs over its first five years – possibly more than the purchase priceold appliances aren’t the only thing around your house that can cost you money old singlepane windows jack up your energy bill by letting heated or cooled air out of your house crumbling plumbing fixtures often use more water than newer ones adding to your water billto compare the true cost of repairing and replacing an item take these ongoing costs into account simply calculate the fiveyear cost of both the new item and the repair here’s howdetermine how much the old item is costing you per year include all the costs of running it such as water and electricity costs for a washing machine then multiply that number by five the result is its fiveyear operating costfind out how much it will cost to repair the old item add that cost to the number you got in the first step this is the total fiveyear cost of keeping the old item in working conditionnow calculate how much a replacement would cost to run over that same fiveyear period add that cost to its purchase price this is the total fiveyear cost of the new versioncompare the two numbers if the first one is lower that means it’s cheaper to repair the item than replace it if it’s higher replacement is the more affordable option will its value increasemost things decline in value as they age for example a oneyearold car is worth nearly  less than a brandnew one according to edmunds clothes appliances and furniture also lose value as they grow older and more worn outhowever there are some items – such as antiques and collectibles – that increase in value over time if your defective item is an antique – or something that might one day become an antique – the money you put into repairing it is an investment some day that old chair could be worth many times what you spend today to fix itit’s not always obvious when something you own is likely to gain in value for instance frugalliving expert jeff yeager tells the story of a “clunky” old set of jbl speakers he owned as a teenager he thought they looked dated and wanted to replace them with a newer cheaper set but his father vetoed that plan – and today those old “classics” are worth nearly as much as his k account what’s the disposal costsometimes the cost of replacing an item doesn’t end when you buy a new one at the store – you may have to pay to dispose of the old one for example in some towns you have to pay extra to put out bulky items such as appliances for trash pickupbefore you decide to replace an item find out how you can get rid of the old one if this will cost you extra add those disposal costs when you’re calculating the fiveyear cost of replacement that extra cost could be enough to tip the balance and make repairing the cheaper optionremember that replacing an old item doesn’t have to mean throwing it out if the old broken item only needs a minor repair – or if it could be used for spare parts – someone else might be willing to take it off your hands try listing it on your local freecycle group or just put it out by the curb with a sign that says “free” if anybody wants it you can avoid the cost of disposal and help your community do you love itin many cases deciding whether to repair or replace is a simple matter of dollars and cents but sometimes it’s more complicated if the item that’s broken is something you truly love then a new one can never replace itfor example suppose you have an old bicycle that you bought as a teen with the money from your first job it’s not as fancy as a newer bike but it was the first big purchase you ever made and you’ve ridden it for so many years that it feels like a part of you to you that old bike’s value is more than the price it would fetch on craigslist so even if repairing it would cost more than buying a new bicycle it’s worth it on a personal leveljust as it’s worth paying more to keep something you love it’s not worth paying to keep something you hate if your bathroom has an old mustardyellow toilet that you just can’t stand the sight of having it break down gives you a chance to upgrade even if you could repair it with just a  wax ring it could be worth spending an extra  for a new toilet that you enjoygetting the best dealwhether you repair or replace you want to get the best value there’s no point in spending money on a repair that won’t hold up or a replacement that won’t last here are several tips on how to get the best possible dealthe best deal on repairsit’s always cheapest to repair an item yourself – if you know how if you don’t know what you’re doing you could make the problem worse for instance suppose you take apart a broken clock and then can’t figure out how to adjust it at that point having it put back together may cost more than buying a new clockthat doesn’t mean you always need to seek out a professional for jobs that are new to you before you shell out money for repairs try doing an internet search on the repair such as “fix leaky toilet” often a quick search will give you stepbystep instructionssometimes you can even find videos that walk you through the process there are many howto videos on youtube posted by both professionals and homeowners another useful site is repairclinic which features more than  videos showing how to fix all sorts of appliances lawn care tools and hvac equipmentif you can’t fix it yourself go to a local repair shop in a  survey consumer reports found that people who used independent shops were happier with the results than those who used factory service local shops are usually cheaper too – especially for large appliances and lawn equipmentthere is one catch however if your product is still under warranty you have to use a factoryauthorized repair shop if you don’t you could void the warranty in this case all you can do is make sure the repair person is trained to handle your productthe best deal on replacementif you decide to replace your product do some research before you buy check reviews at consumersearch or the wirecutter to find a new one that will work well and hold up over time you can also consult consumer reports online if you have a subscription or check the printed issues at your local librarywhen shopping for a replacement plan ahead nearly everything breaks sooner or later so it’s best to buy a product that’s easy to repair for instance when you buy an appliance make sure that it’s easy to find parts for it if you’re buying a car find out which repair shops in your area know how to work on that modeleven for a smaller purchase such as a pair of shoes planning ahead can save money in the long run if you buy sturdy shoes with soles that can be replaced when they wear out you should be able to resole them three to ten times before the uppers wear out all in all you could get  years of life out of one pair of shoes that’s a lot cheaper in the long run than buying a new pair of cheap shoes every yearone thing that’s not worth paying extra for is a warranty consumer reports found most products don’t break until after the warranty is up even when they do the savings aren’t that great on average people who bought a warranty or service contract paid  for it while those who paid for repairs outofpocket spent only  moreworse still the people who got their repairs done under warranty weren’t as happy with the results they were more likely than other people to wait two weeks or longer for a repair they were also more likely to have the repair done incorrectlyonce you’ve bought your new item take care of it read the manual and follow its advice about maintenance for clothing and shoes follow the care instructions on the label an item that’s handled properly won’t wear out as fast so you’re more likely to get your money’s worth out of itfinal wordgetting things fixed certainly isn’t as easy as it used to be as items like clothing and electronics have become cheaper many repair shops have gone out of businessstill fixing items yourself can be easier these days the internet makes it simple to find out how to fix all kinds of things at home online guides can show you how to repair clothing books appliances and even computersso when something breaks at least look into the possibility of repairing it if it’s fixable you can save a lot of money and prevent waste if not at least you can feel confident that replacing it was the right choicedo you
