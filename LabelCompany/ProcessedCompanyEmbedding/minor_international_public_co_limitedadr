million visitors even with concerns following brexit the united kingdom remained the biggest tourist market for portugal followed by spain france germany and holland as tourism fears of geopolitical instabilities and terrorism drove customers away from other mediterranean destinations portugal has been the prime beneficiary along with spain the algarve tourism board has issued a statement that “ will be the best year ever” for the region’s tourism brazil the hospitality industry in brazil has seen declining occupancies since  primarily as a result of the slowdown of the country’s gdp growth rate in  the economy continued to be sluggish undermined by the political instability with the impeachment of the country’s president relatively resort hotels performed better than city hotels as the resort sector benefited from the steep devaluation of the brazilian real whereby the country has become a cheaper destination for foreign tourists in addition brazilians also took more domestic trips as travel abroad became more expensive  shows signs of recovery in brazil with stabilized demand and limited growth of new supply in addition the economic and political conditions have already seen signs of improvement with real gdp growth inflation control and lower interest rates overall minor hotels remains optimistic about the longterm prospect of the tourism sector in brazil indian ocean

largest contributor to the economy with the total contribution representing over  of total gdp over the past few years the international arrival growth to the maldives has been driven by chinese which for the first  months of  accounted for almost  of total visitors however over the same period number of chinese tourists declined by over  primarily attributable to the slowdown in chinese economy and the chinese currency devaluation as a result maldives ministry of tourism has revised down the  target of international arrivals from  million to  million the same level as  with additional hotel openings in    the maldives will be a challenging market however over time the maldives tourism has proven itself to be resilient and rebounded quickly with its strong reputation as a tourist destination we believe the maldives will retain its appeal in the longterm sri lanka has seen its number of tourist arrivals double in just four years from  million in  to  million in  the beauty of the country and the hospitality of the people have been the natural attractions in addition the investment in infrastructure across the country has helped spur rapid economic growth and social

growth various investments have been put in the region including in hotel rooms infrastructure and airports to name a few the new victoria falls international airport in zimbabwe the increased flights at livingstone airport in zambia and the expansion of kasane international airport in botswana will strategically expand the tourist traffic to the region the middle east  was a challenging year for

addition to capturing the huge potential of the tourism industry in china itself our strategy is to build brand equity with chinese travelers for their outbound traveling even with over  million outbound chinese tourists in  chinese outbound tourism is still in the initial stage with promising growth in the long term since  the chinese government has viewed tourism as a “pillar industry” with strategic importance to the national economy and as a service industry that meets the needs and wishes of the population increased income longterm accumulated tourism demand of chinese people
