communication phototom campbell download photo west lafayette ind  professor of food and nutrition sciences mario ferruzzi will receive purdue universitys  agricultural research award for his work in helping to improve food quality and human health and to reduce chronic disease  the award is given each year to a faculty member in the college of agriculture with less than  years of experience beyond a doctoral degree it is for scientists who have demonstrated a high level of excellence in research and made significant contributions to agriculture natural resources and quality of life for indiana citizens ferruzzi has dual appointments in the college of agricultures department of food science and the college of health and human sciences department of nutrition science mario has made exceptional contributions to understanding how food matrix and processing factors affect nutrient absorption from our food and his work can lead to the further development of functional foods to improve human health said jay akridge glenn w sample dean of agriculture he is most deserving of our colleges top research award ferruzzi will receive the award monday may  at  am edt in the deans auditorium at pfendler hall on the west lafayette campus ferruzzis work will help the food industry develop products of improved nutritional and functional quality said karen plaut associate dean and director of agricultural research at purdue dr ferruzzis research has an impact on fundamental and applied aspects of both food science and nutrition as he works to identify food science strategies that will contribute to improving human health and reducing chronic disease risk she said ferruzzis expertise has helped him develop and apply analytical methods for quantifying bioactive food components and phytochemicals in food and assessing their bioavailability and distribution to body tissues his findings have improved the understanding of the role that phytochemicals can have on human health including diabetes heart disease cancer and alzheimers disease ferruzzi said the award is an acknowledgement of the many team efforts that have involved his work this is an individual award that is not individual in any way he said we dont write grants in isolation we dont do research in isolation and we dont even get ideas in isolation anymore collectively we can do a lot of really good things together im a prime example of that ive made good decisions about the areas ive worked on about how weve worked on them and how weve pursued the funding and this award says good things about the collaborations ive been lucky enough to be a part of  after earning his masters degree in  and phd in  in food science and nutrition at ohio state university ferruzzi spent nearly

quick links agricultural research at purdue page contentag research spotlight mario ferruzzi as the analytical tools get better the questions get more complex and deep –mario ferruzzi the ag research spotlight shines each month on an individual whose work reflects our commitment to the six strategic themes that guide agricultural research at purdue our spotlight for october  underscores the theme “people enhancing food and health” the researcher as an undergraduate chemistry major at duke university ferruzzi found summer employment with the north carolina state university seafood laboratory there he learned a little about food processing and found application for his basic science after completing his doctorate in food science and nutrition at the ohio state university in  ferruzzi worked for nestlé first in ohio and then at the company’s research center in switzerland when he joined the purdue faculty in  he brought industryfocused relevance to his research food science is a discipline that exists in a university because of its stakeholders the food industry and consumers he says the research ferruzzi’s research focuses on two main classes of plantderived compounds polyphenols and natural pigments carotenoids and chlorophylls that are associated with human health benefits his team wants to understand how these compounds are distributed in the food supply and how they get from the food into our bodies bioavailability he further explores how they react to food formulation and processing how they are delivered to the consumer and ultimately how the human body utilizes them applications understanding how food delivers healthpromoting compounds and what the body does with them can lead to improved recommendations for consumers a second purpose has to do with the design validation and implementation of food products “our application point is to guide the development of food products to optimize the way the body uses these foods” ferruzzi says “we want to help the industry mature and grow with sound science”​ tools of the trade “technology is critical you can ask the questions but you have to have the tools to answer them i couldn’t do it without the complex analytical systems i have available to me in my lab and more broadly at purdue” adaptation in the current funding environment ferruzzi believes he must continually adapt his research to maintain both relevance and competitiveness working with colleagues at purdue’s international food technology center for example he has been studying products made with biofortified maize and sorghum targeted to atrisk consumers in developing countries “i’ve been very fortunate in this work to have had tremendous collaborators” he says “eight years ago i never imagined working in foods for developing countries now it’s an exciting part of what i might be able to do long term​​​ page content second columnquick links view all research spotlights download the pdf version view mario
