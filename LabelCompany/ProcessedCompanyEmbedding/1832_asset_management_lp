do not move in tandem moreover even if the direction of chinas economy is uncertain wong argues that the worst appears to be over there are some signs of stabilization he says noting that the purchasing managers index is back in positive territory if the economy continues to be weak there will be more fiscal stimuli like other countries china will respond with policy initiatives the
