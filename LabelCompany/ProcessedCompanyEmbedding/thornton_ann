posted by pauleggmailcom on th may  the perfect product for the job great for implants posted by unknown on th mar  i knew what i was ordering this floss is great for all the implants i have great delivery too thanks amazon for continuing to have wonderful vendors nice but could be better posted by kurt hertel on th jun  i have been using these for  years due to implants and bridges my dentist recommended them and i have liked the idea of not having to use a leader loop to pass the floss under the appliance i usually get the  pkg the last batch i received seemed to be constructed of poorer quality than the previous  or so batches the blue coating used to stiffen the leader ends seemed to be less thick allowing the ends to bend with very little resistance and as a result i had to resort to the loop leader the whole idea for me was to eliminate this step after finishing the first of my  boxes last week i can report that the issue ive had seems to have been corrected perhaps i just got a poor batch all in all a great idea and a good product tried them all posted by unknown on th feb  i have a  post full upper implant that is difficult to clean i have tried every product on the market this threaderfloss combo is by far the best please improve the packaging mine are in a snack bag best implant  bridge floss posted by unknown on th mar  this is the best and is well worth the price cleanest by far posted by hope eknoian on st mar  i have used these for a few years and they are great if only they could find a better way of packing pulling one out and they all follow i undo the whole thing and get them all together and put a bread wrapper clip and then just have to pull one and get one takes up a lot of room but so much easier also great foe cleaning hearing aids just the right size to be tight great item posted by roger on th jan  i learned of these from my dentist and found they work great now i keep a couple extra packs on hand at all times best of flosses posted by sis on th dec  i mentioned to my hygienist last time there that seems the super flosses are not as thick as they used to be she gave me a pkg of these flosses to try i found these are exactly what i need to get the job done right i have several permanent bridges and some implants so happy now great product posted by mary n on th dec  the product is great as well as the company and

b ratedthis is a god sendi had been unemployed for the past three years and the irs and state had a lien on me for back taxes i had fallen ill and unable to work all that time over the years i received letters in the mail from different tax solution companies but could not act on them since i was unemployed i finally did call one when i knew i was going to get a job but the man who took my call was not very professional and did not seem to care about my situation by gods grace a week later once employed i heard an advertisement over the radio on my way home from church i quickly put the number in my phone and called them on that monday i received the most polite person terrance who made me feel i could get through this situation with no problem i told him i had just started working only two weeks and was trying to be proactive in getting in front of my tax situation by calling them to see what they could do to help me terrance assured me they would be able to help and would be willing to work around my just getting started with my first check the company victory tax solutions allowed me to make two installments to get started all the paperwork was submitted to me to sign within days of my first installment so they could get started working on my case after the second payment terrance gave me a call the very next business day along with an attorney and explained to me how my case would go and what i could expect i have  in tax debt between the two agencies and victory tax solutions will be able to bring that to zero i am so grateful that i heard their advertisement and took the time to call they have been on top of every thing since i contacted them a month ago i am also impressed in how quickly they processed my case if it hadnt been for me getting paid every two weeks i would have seen results in a matter of weeks thank you victory tax solutions for all your hard work and for caring for those of us who are trying to get our lives back on trackvictory tax solutionsrichard s ratedi received a lockin letter from the irs and if it would have been implemented it would have created a huge hardship on me and my family i can honestly say it was one of the most stressful situations ive experienced i knew that i had to do something but didnt have the know how on how to dispute this furthermore my past experiences with trying to work with the irs have not been successful so i looked online and came across victory tax solutions i first talked to matt who was very helpful in gathering up my information and explaining to me what to expect and the pricing after my information was gathered i was then told i would be working with their attorney lyle i wasnt sure what to expect because ive never really had any good experiences with attorneys ive always found them to be easily annoyed with questions not the case with lyle he went above and beyond in making sure i understood exactly what was going on and made sure he answered all my questions lyle explained to me what was going to happen and the estimated time frame i received some further calls clarifying some information he even sent a few emails along the way explaining the current progress and to my surprise even the emails were very detailed in less than two weeks lyle was able to fix the issue with the lockin letter and then renegotiated a better payment plan and put in for a waiver of some penalties on my behalf i do have to say at first i was a little hesitant due to the price but it was less than other attorneys and far less than what it would have cost me in the long run and the short term for that matter the irs is not an easy group to deal with on your own i cannot recommend vts enough to anyone experiencing any issues with the irs lyle and matt exceeded my expectations their communication and the outcome of their work could not have been any better if you are having any issues with the irs do yourself a favor and hand off that stress to victoryvictory tax

notice that i owed over  in back taxes needless to say that a notice like that gives you a new perspective on the exact location of your rear end i entrusted my tax return to that hr somebody and ended up with an irs dilemma after going back and forth with the hr people i decided it was more important to take care of the irs problem and then deal with the incompetence of my tax preparer that night i spent several hours on the interweb and found vts and erick finkiewicz immediately he assured me that in some way shape or form this issue would get resolved that night i felt a bit of relief and was able to sleep without that heavy burden of taking on the irs by myself vts gave my case to jennifer long  words cannot be put in this review that can measure the gratitude that i owe to this person that i only know by phone calls and emails  jennifer took my case explained to me the situation that i was in and how we were going to get resolution with it im not going to tell you that things were resolved over night because they werent but jennifer kept me abreast of everything the whole time finally in may of this year i received resolution in my case i could not be any happier with the outcome that vts and jennifer long got for me vts is located in ann arbor mi and im in miami fl but it always felt like they were right up the street from me all my phone calls and emails were always answered expeditiously i recommend this company to anyone who is looking for professionals to deal with a serious problem with the precision of a surgeon thank you victory tax solutions

nice and helpful and got us back on good terms with the irs  our story doesnt end there erick would call us every once in a while to make sure every thing was okay offered us help and guidance if we needed it i was really glad when he called a few months ago because things had really changed my husband ended up in the hospital and the doctor said he needed to apply for disability because his health was so bad he could no longer work worried about how we would pay all the bills but especially the tax agreement i asked erick how we could get our payments lowered he took care of every thing he got us a lawyer who contacted the i rs and because of our situation we dont have to make payments we will still owe and if things change will pay what we owebut for now they wont be harassing us i was skeptical when my husband first called victory tax solution but i am so glad he did no way could we have handled this without help  i would recommend this company to anyone having tax problemsand

going to put a levy and put a garnishment on all of my husbands assets even after making a installment agreement with the irs for  a month with oweing  to the irs so one evening my husband and i started looking through the yellow book pages and we found victory tax solutions and called but at that time no one was in the office the office had closed for the day so i left a message on their

money was super tight victory tax solutions had the garnishments on my paychecks released within a week or two of submitting my first payment beginning my case also they worked mostly with my fiance

doing in the end they deal that victory worked out for me with the state of california and the irs totally fit my budget and i now have a renewed sense of comfort in knowing that i will have all of my back taxes repaid in a few years and my family wont suffer from it and i never had to call the collectors and sit on hold not once thank you steve starla and heather at victory tax solutions for all

precisely i would like to personally relay my sincerest appreciation to heather gosnick tax attorney and steven hook senior settlement officer from my very first encounter they demonstrated full confidence on how to proceed were very clear on timelines and expectations were very thorough with explanations and provide ample feedback during the entire process i was extremely  apprehensive at

comprehensive and relaxing in summary my case was settled with the irs in my favor from a claim that i owe in excess of k in back taxes to receiving an irs tax return for the year in question although
