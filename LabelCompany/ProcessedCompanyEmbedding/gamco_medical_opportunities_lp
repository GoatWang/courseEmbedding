experienced client “churn” in  in the institutional and high net worth space over one half of the assets lost were subadvisory assets where the advisor underwent a change in control for instance a spinoff from the parent organization or the sale of the advisor to a third party the successor advisor assumed management of the assets in january  as part of a firmwide branding initiative the names of eight mutual funds managed by gabelli funds llc a subsidiary of gamco investors inc were changed to gamco  the gamco brand more appropriately differentiates the various investment strategies offered to investors including growth gold convertible securities and contrarian  funds continuing to use the gabelli name primarily represent value portfolios managed in the absolute return

upon at least  days prior written notice subject to certain provisions our research and institutional sales team at gabelli  company inc hosted seven industry symposiums and conferences during   these symposiums and conferences provided an opportunity for the firm’s institutional clients to meet with the senior management teams of leading companies and gain insight on the dynamics within these industries  our events in  included our th annual automotive aftermarket symposium our  th pump valve  motor symposium our  th annual aircraft supplier conference fourth annual dental conference our second annual rfid radio frequency identification conference and our first annual water infrastructure conference business strategy our business strategy targets global growth of the franchise through continued leveraging of our proven asset management strengths including our brand name longterm performance record diverse product offerings and experienced investment research and client service professionals  in order to achieve growth in assets under management and profitability we are pursuing a strategy which includes the following key elements ·   incentive fees and fulcrum fees our investment strategy is focused on adding stock specific alpha through our proprietary private market value pmv with a catalyst tm equity research efforts  we expect to receive an increasing portion of ourrevenues and earnings through various products with incentive and fulcrum fees  since we envision that a growing percentage of the firms revenues will be directly linked to performancebased fees this will also increase the variability of our revenues and profits  as of december   over  billion of separate account assets are managed on a performance fee basis along with  billion of preferred issues and  million of investment partnership assets  unlike most money management firms we elected not to receive a management fee on preferred offerings in closedend funds until the fund’s overall performance exceeds each preferred’s nominal cost of capital  in january  we launched the gabelli global deal fund a new closedend fund that earns a base fee plus a fulcrum performance fee of one quarter percent for each percentage point the funds return exceeds the  day u s treasury bill rate up to a maximum of  percent  in addition the incubation of new product strategies using proprietary capital will compensate the investment team with a performance fee model to reinforce our payforperformance approach ·   corporate branding initiative    we have undertaken a series of branding initiatives to enhance longterm shareholder value  on august   our corporate name change to gamco investors inc became effective  since the firm was founded in  gamco has been the name of our asset management business representing our institutional and high net worth effort we believe changing our corporate name to gamco helps us achieve our vision for assets entrusted to us that is to earn a superior return for our clients by providing various valueadded alpha products gamco is a more inclusive parent company name and more appropriately represents the various investment strategies and asset management brands contributing to the continued growth of our company the gabelli brand will continue to represent our absolute return researchdriven value style that focuses on our unique private market value pmv with a catalyst ™ investment approach ·   establishing research and relationship centers in addition to our corporate office in rye ny we have six offices which conduct portfolio management research and marketing activities in the united states and abroad in the following cities  greenwich ct chicago il minneapolis mn palm beach fl reno nv and london uk  our offices in chicago and minneapolis were established as the result of acquisitions of ongoing investment advisory operations  the london office was opened in january  to provide a geographic presence overseas and to coordinate investment research and marketing activities for our investment offerings in the european markets                                                ·   introducing new products and services   we believe we have the capacity for development of new products and services around the gabelli and gamco brands to complement our existing product offerings new products since our initial public offering include    three openend mutual funds  gabelli blue chip value fund  gabelli utilities fund  and the gabelli woodland small cap value fund       four closedend funds the gabelli dividend  income trust the gabelli global utility and income trust the gabelli global gold natural resources  income trust and the gabelli utility trust      five offshore funds  gabelli global partners ltd gabelli european partners ltd gabelli japanese value partners ltd gamco performance partners ltd and gamco sri partners ltd      nine private limited partnerships  gemini global partners lp gabelli european partners lp gabelli japanese value partners lp gabelli associates fund ii lp gamco performance partners lp gama select energy plus lp gamco telecom plus lp gamco medical opportunities lp and gabelli umbrella fund lp   during january  we also launched the gabelli global deal fund nyse gdl a unique closedend fund which will seek to achieve its investment objective of absolute return by investing primarily in announced merger and acquisition transactions and to a lesser extent in corporate reorganizations involving stubs spinoffs and liquidations this fund provides the advisor with a fulcrum fee consistent with our strategy of alpha creation ·   promulgating the gabelli “ private market value pmv with a catalyst tm ” investment approach   while we have expanded our investment product offerings our “value investing” approach remains the core of our business  this method is based on the value investing principles articulated by graham  dodd in  and further augmented by mario j gabelli with his development of private market value pmv with a catalyst tm   and his introduction of a catalyst into the value investment methodology  the development of pmv analysis combined with the concept of a catalyst has evolved into our value investing approach commonly referred to as private market value pmv with a catalyst tm   investing   private market value pmv with a catalyst tm  investing is a disciplined researchdriven approach based on the extensive use of security analysis  in this process we carefully select stocks whose intrinsic value based on our estimate of current asset value and future growth and earnings power is significantly different from the value as reflected in the public market  we then calculate the firm’s pmv which is defined as the price an informed industrial buyer would be likely to pay to acquire the business   to limit the time horizon in which the pmv is likely to be realized we look for situations in which catalysts are working to help eliminate the premium or realize the discount between the public market price and the estimated pmv  catalysts which are company specific include  realization of hidden assets recognition of underperforming subsidiaries share buybacks spinoffs mergers and acquisitions balance sheet changes new products accounting changes new management and crossshareholder unwinding  other catalysts are related to industry dynamics or macroeconomics and include but are not limited to industry consolidation deregulation accounting tax pension and political reforms technological change and the macroeconomic backdrop  the time horizons for catalysts to trigger change can either be shortterm mediumterm or longterm    to further extend “value investing” and our fundamental research approach to stock selection    we sponsored value investing seminars in milan and london for institutional investors from leading uk and other european business schools  the seminars were hosted by bruce n greenwald the robert heilbrunn professor of finance and asset management at columbia university graduate school of business and the academic director of the heilbrunn center for graham  dodd investing      we established the graham  dodd murray greenwald prize for value investing in coordination with the columbia university graduate school of business  the monetary prize is awarded each year at gamco’s annual client meeting to the individual who best exemplifies the goals of refining extending and disseminating the practice of value investing      gamco underwrote a series of lectures on value investing by professor roger f murray the coauthor of the fifth edition of security analysis    this series of lectures served as a catalyst to refocus the columbia university graduate school of business’s curriculum to value investing leading to the eventual creation of the graham  dodd center ·   expanding mutual fund distribution   we continue to expand our distribution network primarily through national and regional brokerage firms and have developed additional classes of shares for most of our mutual funds for sale through these firms and other thirdparty distribution channels on a commission basis  we intend to increase our wholesaling efforts to market the multiclass shares which have been designed to meet the needs of investors who seek advice through financial consultants ·   increasing presence in high net worth market   our high net worth business focuses in general on serving clients who have established an account relationship of  million or more with us  according to industry estimates the number of households with over  million in investable assets will continue to grow in the future subject to ups and downs in the equity and fixed income markets  with our year history of serving this segment longterm performance record customized portfolio approach dominant taxsensitive buyhold investment strategy brand name recognition and broad array of product offerings we believe that we are wellpositioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this market ·   increasing marketing for institutional separate accounts   the institutional separate accounts business was principally developed through direct marketing channels historically pension and financial consultants have not been a major source of new institutional separate accounts business for us  we plan to augment our institutional sales force through the addition of staff to market directly to the consultant community as well as our traditional marketing channels ·   attracting and retaining experienced professionals   we have increased the scope of our investment management capabilities by adding portfolio managers and other investment personnel in order to expand our broad array of products  the ability to attract and retain highlyexperienced investment and other professionals with a longterm commitment to us and our clients has been and will continue to be a significant factor in our longterm growth ·   sponsorship of industry conferences gabelli  company inc our institutional research boutique sponsors industry conferences and management events throughout the year at these conferences and events senior management from leading industry companies share their thoughts on the industry competition regulatory issues and the challenges and opportunities in their businesses with portfolio managers and securities analysts  we currently host annual industry conferences and symposiums which include the automotive aftermarket symposium  years pump valve  motor symposium  years aircraft supplier conference  years and dental conference  years  consistent with our innovative research on emerging technologies we sponsored conferences focusing on rfid radio frequency identification in  as well as our first annual water infrastructure conference                                                ·   hosting of investor symposiums   we have a tradition of sponsoring symposiums that bring together prominent portfolio managers members of academia and other leading business professionals to present discuss and debate current issues and topics in the investment industry  “active vs passive stock selection”  “the role of hedge funds as a way of generating absolute returns”  “virtues of value investing”  “dividends taxable versus nontaxable issues”  “closedend funds premiums vs discounts dividends and distributions” we also hold annual conferences for our investment partnership clients and prospects in new york and london at which our portfolio management team discusses the investment environment our strategies and portfolios and eventdriven investment opportunities ·   capitalizing on acquisitions and strategic alliances   we intend to selectively and opportunistically pursue acquisitions and alliances that will broaden our product offerings and add new sources of distribution  in november  we completed our alliance with woodland partners llc a minneapolis based investment advisor of institutional high networth and subadvisory accounts  on october   we completed our alliance with mathers and company inc and now act as investment advisor to the mathers fund renamed gamco mathers fund and in may  we added comstock partners funds inc renamed comstock funds inc  the mathers and comstock funds are part of our nonmarket correlated mutual fund product line we believe that we have the entrepreneurial flexibility and corporate resume to pursue acquisitions and alliances we believe that our growth to date is tracable to the following factors ·   strong industry fundamentals   according to data compiled by the us federal reserve the investment management industry has grown faster than more traditional segments of the financial services industry including the banking and insurance industries since gbl began managing institutional separate accounts in  world equity markets have grown at a  compounded annual growth rate through december   including the net addition of new stocks in many countries to  trillion a   the us equity market comprises about  trillion a or  of world equity markets  we believe that demographic trends and the growing role of money managers in the placement of capital compared to the traditional role played by banks and life insurance companies will result in continued growth of the investment management industry ·   longterm performance   we have a superior longterm record of achieving relatively high returns for our separate account clients we believe that our performance record represents a competitive advantage and a recognized component of our franchise ·   stock market gains   since we began managing institutional separate accounts in  our traditional valueoriented separate account composite has earned a compound annual return of  net of fees versus a compound annual return of  for the   sp  through december    since our initial public

offerings in us equities us fixed income global and international equities convertible securities us balanced and investment partnerships our financial strength is underscored by having received an investment grade rating from two wellrespected ratings agencies moody’s investors services and standard and poor’s ratings services  we believe that maintaining these investment grade ratings will provide greater access to the capital markets enhance liquidity and lower overall borrowing costs however we will also consider the use of leverage as part of our corporate financial strategy even if it results in a lowering of our investment rating a source birinyi associates llc business description gbl was originally founded in  as an institutional brokerdealer  we entered the separate accounts

shareholders of the openend funds are allowed to exchange shares among the same class of shares of the other openend funds as economic and market conditions and investor needs change at no additional cost  however as noted below certain mutual funds impose a  redemption fee on shares redeemed in seven days or less after a purchase we periodically introduce new mutual funds designed to complement and expand our investment product offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of investors on december   the shareholders of the gabelli abc fund voted to approve a charter amendment that would require investment accounts held at the funds transfer agent state street bank  trust company be directly registered to the beneficial owners of the fund  the action which was recommended by gabelli funds llc “funds advisor” and approved by the fund’s board of directors permits the redemption of shares held through certain brokers and financial consultants in omnibus and individual accounts where the beneficial owner is not disclosed in january  funds advisor announced that the board of trustees of the ned davis research funds voted to liquidate the ned davis research asset allocation fund and distribute the assets to shareholders the board agreed that liquidating the fund which was launched on march   was in the best interests of shareholders given its asset level ongoing transactional and operating costs and limited marketability  the liquidation took place on february   our marketing efforts for the mutual funds are currently focused on increasing the distribution and sales of our existing funds as well as creating new products for sale through our distribution channels we believe that our marketing efforts for the mutual funds will continue to generate additional revenues from investment advisory fees we have traditionally distributed most of our openend mutual funds by using a variety of direct response marketing techniques including telemarketing and advertising and as a result we maintain direct relationships with many of our noload openend mutual fund customers beginning in late  we expanded our product distribution by offering several of our openend mutual funds through thirdparty distribution programs including ntf programs in  and  we further expanded these efforts to include substantially all of our openend mutual funds in thirdparty distribution programs more than  of the assets under management in the openend mutual funds are still attributable to our direct response marketing efforts thirdparty distribution programs have become an increasingly important source of asset growth for us  of the  billion of assets under management in the openend equity mutual funds as of december   approximately  were generated through thirdparty distribution programs  we are responsible for paying the service and distribution fees charged by many of the thirdparty distribution programs although a portion of such service fees under certain circumstances are payable by the funds  several bills have been introduced in congress that would amend the investment company act  these proposals which include but are not limited to the elimination or restriction of rule b distribution fees if enacted or adopted could have a substantial impact on the regulation and operation of our registered funds  in light of such legislation and efforts by some of the program sponsors to increase fees beyond what we deem to be acceptable several of our mutual funds may be withdrawn from such programs  during  we completed development of additional classes of shares for many of our mutual funds for sale through national brokerage and investment firms and other thirdparty distribution channels on a commission basis  the multiclass shares are available in all of gabelli mutual funds except the gabelli abc fund gabelli capital asset fund and the gamco mathers fund although the

management firms and mutual fund companies insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that have similar features and investment objectives to those offered by us  many of the investment management firms with which we compete are subsidiaries of large diversified financial companies and many others are much larger in terms of assets under management and revenues and accordingly have much larger sales organizations and marketing budgets  historically we have competed primarily on the basis of the longterm investment performance of many of our investment products  however we have taken steps to increase our distribution channels brand name awareness and marketing efforts the market for providing investment management services to institutional and high net worth separate accounts is also highly competitive approximately  of our investment advisory fee revenue for the year ended december   was derived from our separate accounts  selection of investment advisors by us institutional investors is often subject to a screening process and to favorable recommendations by investment industry consultants  many of these

requirements could have a material adverse effect on us                                                investments by gbl on behalf of our clients often represent a significant equity ownership position in an issuers class of stock as of december   we had five percent or more beneficial ownership with respect to approximately  equity securities this activity raises frequent regulatory and legal issues regarding our aggregate beneficial ownership level with respect to portfolio securities including issues relating to issuers shareholder rights plans or “poison pills” state gaming laws and regulations federal communications laws and regulations public utility holding company laws and regulations federal proxy rules governing shareholder communications and federal laws and regulations regarding the reporting of beneficial ownership positions  our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us the usa patriot act of  enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on september   contains antimoney laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to brokerdealers mutual funds and other financial services companies including standards for verifying client identification at account opening and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities  antimoneylaundering laws outside of the us contain some similar provisions  our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us we and certain of our affiliates are subject to the laws of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies or bodies in particular we are subject to requirements in numerous jurisdictions regarding reporting of beneficial ownership positions in securities issued by companies whose securities are publiclytraded in those countries in addition gamco is registered as an international advisor investment counsel and portfolio manager with the ontario securities commission in canada in order to market our services to prospective clients who reside in ontario  several of our investment partnerships are organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions in connection with our opening of an office in london and our plans to market certain products in europe we are required to comply with the laws of the united kingdom and other european countries regarding these activities  our subsidiary gamco asset management uk limited is regulated by the financial services authority  in connection with our registration in the united kingdom we have minimum capital requirements that have been consistently met or exceeded recent regulatory developments on september   the new york attorney general’s office “nyag” announced that it had found evidence of widespread improper trading involving mutual fund shares  these transactions included the “late trading” of mutual fund shares after the  pm pricing cutoff and “time zone arbitrage” of mutual fund shares designed to exploit pricing inefficiencies  since the nyag’s announcement the nasd the sec the nyag and officials of other states have been conducting inquiries into and bringing enforcement actions related to trading abuses in mutual fund shares  we have received information requests and subpoenas from the sec and the nyag in connection with their inquiries and have been complying with these requests for documents and testimony we implemented additional compliance policies and procedures in response to recent industry initiatives and an internal review of our mutual fund practices and procedures in a variety of areas  a special committee of all of our independent directors was also formed to review various issues involving mutual fund share transactions and was assisted by independent counsel as part of our review hundreds of documents were examined and approximately fifteen individuals were interviewed  we have found no evidence that any employee participated in or facilitated any “late trading”  we also have found no evidence of any improper trading in our mutual funds by our investment professionals or senior executives  as we previously reported we did find that in august of  we banned an account which had been engaging in frequent trading in our global growth fund the prospectus of which did not impose limits on frequent trading and which had made a small investment in one of our hedge funds from further transactions with our firm certain other investors had been banned prior to that  we also found that certain discussions took place in  and  between gbl’s staff and personnel of an investment advisor regarding possible frequent trading in certain gabelli domestic equity funds in june  we began discussions with the sec staff for a potential resolution of their inquiry  as a result of these discussions gbl recorded a reserve of approximately  million in the second quarter of   in february  one of our advisory subsidiaries made an offer of settlement to the sec staff for communication to the commission for its consideration to resolve this matter this offer of settlement is subject to final agreement regarding the specific language of the sec’s administrative order and other settlement documents as a result of these developments we increased our reserves as of the fourth quarter of  by  million since these discussions are ongoing we cannot determine at this time whether they will ultimately result in a settlement of this matter whether our reserves will be sufficient to cover any payments by gbl related to such a settlement or whether and to what extent insurance may cover such payments                                                in september  we were informed by the staff of the sec that they may recommend to the commission that one of our advisory subsidiaries be held accountable for the actions of two of the closedend funds managed by the subsidiary relating to section a and rule a of the investment company act of   these provisions require registered investment companies to provide written statements to shareholders when a dividend is made from a source other than net investment income  while the funds sent annual statements containing the required information and  statements as required by the irs the funds did not send written statements to shareholders with each distribution in  and   the staff indicated that they may recommend to the commission that administrative remedies be sought including a monetary penalty the closedend funds changed their notification procedures and we believe that all of the funds are now in compliance in response to industrywide inquiries and enforcement actions a number of regulatory and legislative initiatives were introduced  the sec has proposed and adopted a number of rules under the investment company act and the investment advisers act and is currently studying potential major revisions of other rules  the sec adopted rules requiring written compliance programs for registered investment advisors and registered investment companies and additional disclosures regarding portfolio management and advisory contract renewals  in addition several bills were introduced in a prior congress that if adopted would have amended the investment company act  these proposals if reintroduced and enacted or if adopted by the sec could have a substantial impact on the regulation and operation of our registered and unregistered funds  for example certain of these proposals would among other things limit or eliminate rule b distribution fees limit or prohibit third party soft dollar arrangements and restrict the management of hedge funds and mutual funds by the same portfolio manager the investment management industry is likely to continue facing a high level of regulatory scrutiny and become subject to additional rules designed to increase disclosure tighten controls and reduce potential conflicts of interest  in addition the sec has substantially increased its use of focused inquiries in which it requests information from a number of fund complexes regarding particular practices or provisions of the securities laws  we participate in some of these inquiries in the normal course of our business  changes in laws regulations and administrative practices by regulatory authorities and the associated compliance costs have increased our cost structure and could in the future have a material impact personnel on february   we had a fulltime staff of approximately  individuals of whom  served in the portfolio management research and trading areas  served in the marketing and shareholder servicing areas and  served in the administrative area as part of our staff we employ  portfolio managers for the mutual funds separate accounts and investment partnerships                                                item a risk factors business risks   we caution the reader that the following business risks and those risks described elsewhere in this report and in our other sec filings could cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations stated in our forwardlooking statements   risks related to our industry   changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could limit the sources and amounts of our revenues increase our costs of doing business decrease our profitability and materially and adversely affect our business   our business is subject to extensive regulation in the united states primarily at the federal level including regulation by the sec under the investment company act and the investment advisers act by the department of labor under the erisa as well as regulation by the nasd and state regulators the mutual funds managed by gabelli funds llc and gabelli advisers inc are registered with the sec as investment companies under the investment company act the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations on investment advisors including recordkeeping advertising and operating requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational requirements on registered investment companies and investment advisors our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines censure suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our registration as an investment advisor or brokerdealer industry regulations are designed to protect our clients and investors in our funds and other third parties who deal with us and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets they are not designed to protect our stockholders changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could limit the sources and amounts of our revenues increase our costs of doing business decrease our profitability and materially and adversely affect our business   in response to scandals in the financial services industry regarding late trading market timing and selective disclosure of portfolio information various legislative and regulatory proposals are pending in or before or have been adopted by the us congress the legislatures in states in which we conduct operations and the various regulatory agencies that supervise our operations including the sec these proposals to the extent enacted or adopted could have a substantial impact on the regulation and operation of registered funds investment advisors and brokerdealers and could adversely affect our assets under management revenues and net income additionally the sec the nasd and other regulators as well as congress are investigating certain practices within our industry these investigations could lead to further legislative and regulatory proposals that if enacted or adopted could adversely affect our business   to the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of price we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure   the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of price we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure although our investment management fees vary from product to product historically we have competed primarily on the performance of our products and not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our competitors in recent years however there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry in order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay our fees in addition the board of directors of each mutual fund managed by gabelli funds llc and gabelli advisers inc must make certain findings as to the reasonableness of its fees we cannot be assured that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations   we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts that may be terminated on short notice   a substantial majority of all of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements and distribution arrangements  investment management agreements and distribution arrangements with the mutual funds are terminable without penalty on  days notice subject to certain additional procedural requirements in the case of termination by a mutual fund and must be specifically approved at least annually as required by law  such annual renewal requires among other things approval by the disinterested members of each mutual funds board of directors or trustees  investment advisory agreements with the separate accounts are typically terminable by the client without penalty on  days notice or less  any failure to renew or termination of a significant number of these agreements or arrangements would have a material adverse effect on us                                                  investors in the openend funds can redeem their investments in these funds at any time without prior notice which could adversely affect our earnings   openend fund investors may redeem their investments in those funds at any time without prior notice investors may reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management for any number of reasons including investment performance changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance in a declining stock market the pace of mutual fund redemptions could accelerate poor performance relative to other asset management firms tends to result in decreased purchases of mutual fund shares and increased redemptions of mutual fund shares the redemption of investments in mutual funds managed by gabelli funds llc or gabelli advisers inc would adversely affect our revenues which are substantially dependent upon the assets under management in our funds if redemptions of investments in mutual funds caused our revenues to decline it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings   certain changes in control of our company would automatically terminate our investment management agreements with our clients unless our separate account clients consent and in the case of fund clients the funds’ boards of directors and shareholders vote to continue the agreements and could prevent us for a twoyear period from increasing the investment advisory fees we are able to charge our mutual fund clients   under the investment company act an investment management agreement with a fund must provide for its automatic termination in the event of its assignment the fund’s board and shareholders must vote to continue the agreement following its assignment the cost of which ordinarily would be borne by us under the investment advisers act a client’s investment management agreement may not be “assigned” by the investment advisor without the client’s consent an investment management agreement is considered under both acts to be assigned to another party when a controlling block of the advisor’s securities is transferred in our case an assignment of our investment management agreements may occur if among other things we sell or issue a certain number of additional common shares in the future we cannot be certain that our clients will consent to assignments of our investment management agreements or approve new agreements with us if an assignment occurs under the investment company act if a fund’s investment advisor engages in a transaction that results in the assignment of its investment management agreement with the fund the advisor may not impose an “unfair burden” on that fund as a result of the transaction for a twoyear period after the transaction is completed the term “unfair burden” has been interpreted to include certain increases in investment advisory fees this restriction may discourage potential purchasers from acquiring a controlling interest in our company regulatory developments designed to increase oversight of hedge funds may adversely affect our business the sec has proposed a rule that would limit the eligibility of individuals to invest in hedge funds by requiring that such individuals own not less than  million in investments at the time of their hedge fund investment the sec may also propose or enact other rules designed to increase oversight of hedge funds by the sec any regulations applicable to hedge funds that may be adopted could have an impact on our operations and may adversely affect our hedge fund business and decrease our future income   a decline in the prices of securities would lead to a decline in our assets under management revenues and earnings   substantially all of our revenues are determined by the amount of our assets under management under our investment advisory contracts with our clients the investment advisory fees we receive are typically based on the market value of assets under management in addition we receive assetbased distribution andor service fees with respect to the openend funds managed by gabelli funds llc or gabelli advisers inc over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of rule b under the investment company act rule b fees typically are based on the market value of assets under management and represented approximately  of our revenues for the year ended december   and  and  of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively accordingly a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenues and net income to decline by either causing the value of our assets under management to decrease which would result in lower investment advisory and rule b fees or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments they perceive to offer greater opportunity or lower risk which would also result in lower fees the securities markets are highly volatile and securities prices may increase or decrease for many reasons including economic and political events and acts of terrorism beyond our control if a decline in securities prices caused our revenues to decline it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings                                                  catastrophic and unpredictable events could have a material adverse effect on our business   a terrorist attack war power failure cyberattack natural disaster or other catastrophic or unpredictable event could adversely affect our future revenues expenses and earnings by interrupting our normal business operations sustaining employee casualties including loss of our key executives requiring substantial expenditures and expenses to repair replace and restore normal business operations and reducing investor confidence   we have a disaster recovery plan to address certain contingencies but we cannot be assured that this plan will be sufficient in responding or ameliorating the effects of all disaster scenarios if our employees or vendors we rely upon for support in a catastrophic event are unable to respond adequately or in a timely manner we may lose clients resulting in a decrease in assets under management which may have a material adverse effect on revenues and net income   risks related to our business   control by mr gabelli of a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock may give rise to conflicts of interests   since our initial public offering in  mr gabelli through his majority ownership of ggcp has beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding class b common stock as of december   ggcp’s holdings of our class b common stock represent approximately  of the combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock  as long as mr gabelli indirectly beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock he will have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs including determinations with respect to acquisitions dispositions borrowings issuances of common stock or other securities and the declaration and payment of dividends on the common stock  in addition mr gabelli will be able to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders for approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change in control of our company  as a result of mr gabellis control none of our agreements with mr gabelli and other companies controlled by him have been arrived at through armslength negotiations although we believe that the parties endeavor to implement marketbased terms  there can be no assurance that we would not have received more favorable terms from an unaffiliated party   in order to minimize conflicts and potential competition with our investment management business in  and as part of our initial public offering mr gabelli entered into a written agreement to limit his activities outside of gbl  mr gabelli has undertaken that so long as he is associated with gbl or for a period of five years from our initial public offering whichever is longer he will not provide investment management services for compensation other than in his capacity as an officer or employee of gbl except for a those investment funds and accounts managed by mr gabelli outside the company under performance fee arrangements but only to the extent that any such investment fund or account consists solely of one or more of the persons who were investors as of the date of the consummation of the initial public offering or such additional investors to the extent that all revenues attributable to such additional investors are paid to gbl and b successor funds and accounts which serve no investors other than those in the funds and accounts referred to in a or those investors successors heirs donees or immediate families which funds and accounts operate according to an investment style similar to such other accounts or funds which style we did not use at the time of our initial public offering and which are subject to performance fee arrangements  to the extent that such activities are not prohibited under this agreement mr gabelli intends to continue devoting time to activities outside gbl including managing his own assets and his familys assets managing or controlling companies in other industries and managing assets for other investors through the permissible accounts which are the funds and accounts managed outside gbl that are permitted under the agreement between us and mr gabelli these assets were approximately  million in february  and approximately  million as the end of   these activities may present conflicts of interest or compete with gbl  our certificate of incorporation expressly provides in general that mr gabelli members of his immediate family who are officers or directors of gbl and entities controlled by such persons have an obligation to present corporate opportunities to us and resolve conflicts of interest through one of the processes described in the certificate of incorporation which include independent director or independent shareholder approval   we will not derive any income from activities outside gbl by mr gabelli except as described above or members of his immediate family who are officers or directors of gbl and may not be able to take advantage of business and investment opportunities that could later prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders either because such opportunities were not gbl opportunities at the time they arose or because we did not pursue them  where a conflict of interest involves a transaction between mr gabelli or members of his immediate family who are officers or directors of gbl or their affiliates and gbl there can be no assurance that we would not receive more favorable terms if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party although we will seek to achieve marketbased terms in all such transactions                                                  we depend on mario j gabelli and other key personnel   we are dependent on the efforts of mr gabelli our chairman of the board chief executive officer and the primary portfolio manager for a significant majority of our assets under management the loss of mr gabellis services would have a material adverse effect on us   in addition to mr gabelli our future success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and attract other qualified personnel to conduct our investment management business  the market for qualified portfolio managers is extremely competitive and has grown more so in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced growth  we anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add portfolio managers and investment analysts as we further diversify our investment products and strategies  there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel  in addition our investment professionals and senior marketing personnel have direct contact with our separate account clients which can lead to strong client relationships  the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with certain separate account clients and result in the loss of such accounts  the loss of key management professionals or the inability to recruit and retain sufficient portfolio managers and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business   potential adverse effects on our performance prospects from a decline in the performance of the securities markets   our results of operations are affected by many economic factors including the performance of the securities markets  during the s unusually favorable and sustained performance of the us securities markets and the us equity market in particular attracted substantial inflows of new investments in these markets and has contributed to significant market appreciation which has in turn led to an increase in our assets under management and revenues  at december   approximately  of our assets under management were invested in portfolios consisting primarily of equity securities  more recently the securities markets in general have experienced significant volatility with declines in value experienced during the years  and  and increases in subsequent years  any decline in the securities markets in general and the equity markets in particular could reduce our assets under management and consequently reduce our revenues  in addition any such decline in the equity markets failure of these markets to sustain their prior levels of growth or continued shortterm volatility in these markets could result in investors withdrawing from the equity markets or decreasing their rate of investment either of which would be likely to adversely affect us  from time to time a relatively high proportion of the assets we manage may be concentrated in particular industry sectors  a general decline in the performance of securities in those industry sectors could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues   possibility of losses associated with proprietary investment activities   we may from time to time make or maintain large proprietary investment positions in securities  market fluctuations and other factors may result in substantial losses in our proprietary accounts which could have an adverse effect on our balance sheet reduce our ability or willingness to make new investments or impair our credit ratings   future investment performance could reduce revenues and other income   success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on investment performance as well as distribution and client servicing  good performance generally stimulates sales of our investment products and tends to keep withdrawals and redemptions low which generates higher management fees which are based on the amount of assets under management  conversely relatively poor performance tends to result in decreased sales increased withdrawals and redemptions in the case of the openend mutual funds and in the loss of separate accounts with corresponding decreases in revenues to us  many analysts of the mutual fund industry believe that investment performance is the most important factor for the growth of open and closedend funds such as those we offer  failure of our investment products to perform well could therefore have a material adverse effect on us   loss of significant separate accounts could affect our revenues   we had approximately  separate accounts as of december   of which the ten largest accounts generated approximately  of our total revenues during the year ended december    loss of these accounts for any reason would have an adverse effect on our revenues  notwithstanding performance we have from time to time lost large separate accounts as a result of corporate mergers and restructurings and we could continue to lose accounts under these or other circumstances                                                during  as in prior years we experienced client “turnover” in the separate accounts over one half of the decrease in assets were subadvisory assets where the advisor underwent a corporate change in control such as a spinoff from a parent organization or the sale of the advisor to a third party a decline in the market for closedend funds could reduce our ability to raise future assets to manage market conditions may preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in closedend mutual funds a significant portion of our recent growth in the assets we manage has resulted from public offerings of the common and preferred shares of closedend mutual funds we have raised  billion in gross assets through closedend fund offerings since january  the market conditions for these offerings may not be as favorable in the future which could adversely impact our ability to grow the assets we manage and our revenue we rely on thirdparty distribution programs   we have since  experienced significant growth in sales of our openend mutual funds through thirdparty distribution programs which are programs sponsored by thirdparty intermediaries that offer their mutual fund customers a variety of competing products and administrative services  most of the sales growth from our thirdparty distribution programs is from programs with no transaction fees payable by the customer which we refer to as ntf programs  approximately  billion of our assets under management in the openend mutual funds as of december   were obtained through ntf programs  the cost of participating in thirdparty distribution programs is higher than our direct distribution costs and it is anticipated that the cost of thirdparty distribution programs will increase in the future  any increase would be likely to have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations  in addition there can be no assurance that the thirdparty distribution programs will continue to distribute the mutual funds  at december   approximately  of the ntf program net assets in the gabelli and westwood families of funds are attributable to two ntf programs  the decision by these thirdparty distribution programs to discontinue distribution of the mutual funds or a decision by us to withdraw one or more of the mutual funds from the programs could have an adverse effect on our growth of assets under management   possibility of losses associated with underwriting trading and marketmaking activities   our underwriting trading and marketmaking activities are primarily conducted through our subsidiary gabelli  company inc both as principal and agent  such activities subject our capital to significant risks of loss  the risks of loss include those resulting from ownership of securities extension of credit leverage liquidity counterparty failure to meet commitments client fraud employee errors misconduct and fraud including unauthorized transactions by traders failures in connection with the processing of securities transactions and litigation  we have procedures and internal controls to address such risks but there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will prevent losses from occurring   we may have liability as a general partner or otherwise with respect to our alternative investment products   certain of our subsidiaries act as general partner for investment partnerships including arbitrage eventdriven longshort sector focused and merchant banking limited partnerships  as a general partner of these partnerships we may be held liable for the partnerships liabilities in excess of their ability to pay such liabilities  in addition in certain circumstances we may be liable as a control person for the acts of our investment partnerships  as of december   our assets under management included approximately  million in investment partnerships  a substantial adverse judgment or other liability with respect to our investment partnerships could have a material adverse effect on us   operational risks may disrupt our businesses result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth   we face operational risk arising from errors made in the execution confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded evaluated or accounted for  our business is highly dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis transactions across markets in an efficient and accurate manner consequently we rely heavily on our financial accounting and other data processing systems if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled we could suffer financial loss a disruption of our businesses liability to clients regulatory intervention or reputational damage                                                  dependence on information systems   we operate in an industry that is highly dependent on its information systems and technology  we outsource a significant portion of our information systems operations to third parties who are responsible for providing the management maintenance and updating of such systems  there can be no assurance however that our information systems and technology will continue to be able to accommodate our growth or that the cost of maintaining such outsourcing arrangements will not increase from its current level  such a failure to accommodate growth or an increase in costs related to these information systems could have a material adverse effect on us   we may not be able to refinance or have the funds necessary to repurchase our existing indebtedness   on august   we and certain of our affiliates entered into a note purchase agreement with cascade investment llc pursuant to which cascade purchased  million in principal amount of a convertible promissory note  pursuant to the terms of the note cascade may require us or upon a change in control or mr gabelli ceasing to provide our predominant executive leadership to repurchase the note ie put option at par plus accrued and unpaid interest on the note  in march  we amended the terms of the note  the new terms extended the exercise date of cascades put option to september   reduced the principal of the convertible note to  million effective april   and removed limitations on the issuance of additional debt in june  gbl and cascade agreed to amend the terms of the note  effective september   the rate on the note increased from  to  while the conversion price was raised to  per share from  per share  in addition the exercise date of cascade’s put option was extended to may   the expiration date of the related letter of credit was extended to may   and a call option was included giving gbl the right to redeem the note at  of its principal amount together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon upon at least  days prior written notice subject to certain provisions if cascade exercises its right under the note to require us to repurchase the note we may not be able to obtain new financing on similar terms to the note and may not have sufficient funds or we may not be able to arrange financing on acceptable terms to pay the repurchase price for the note  if we could not obtain sufficient cash to repurchase the note we would be in default on our obligation under the note purchase agreement   our credit ratings affect our borrowing costs   our borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings a reduction in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets   we face exposure to litigation within our business   the volume of litigation against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed has increased over the past several years  the types of claims that we may face are varied  for example we may face claims against us for purchasing securities that are inconsistent with a client’s investment objectives or guidelines in connection with the operation of the mutual funds or arising from an employment dispute  the risk of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify and may occur years after the activities or events at issue  even if we prevail in a legal action brought against us the costs alone of defending against the action could have a material adverse effect on us   compliance failures and changes in regulation could adversely affect us   our investment management activities are subject to client guidelines and our mutual fund business involves compliance with numerous investment asset valuation distribution and tax requirements  a failure to adhere to these guidelines or satisfy these requirements could result in losses which could be recovered by the client from us in certain circumstances  although we have installed procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators accountants and lawyers to assist us in adhering to these guidelines and satisfying these requirements and maintain insurance to protect ourselves in the case of client losses there can be no assurance that such precautions or insurance will protect us from potential liabilities                                                  our businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the united states including by the sec and the nasd  we are also subject to the laws of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies or bodies  our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our registration or any of our subsidiaries as an investment advisor or brokerdealer  changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on us  the regulatory matters described in the “recent regulatory developments” section above or other regulatory or compliance matters could also have a material adverse effect on us   our reputation is critical to our success   our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our clients mutual fund shareholders and thirdparty intermediaries  in recent years there have been a number of wellpublicized cases involving fraud conflicts of interest or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry  misconduct by our staff or even unsubstantiated allegations could result not only in direct financial harm but also harm to our reputation causing injury to the value of our brands and our ability to retain or attract assets under management  in addition in certain circumstances misconduct on the part of our clients or other parties could damage our reputation  harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on us   we face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies   we compete with numerous investment management companies stock brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks savings and loan associations and other financial institutions  continuing consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own  additionally competing securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products which could limit the distribution of our investment products  to the extent that existing or potential customers including securities dealers decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors the sales of our products as well as our market share revenues and net income could decline   fee pressures could reduce our profit margins   there has been a trend toward lower fees in some segments of the investment management industry  in order for us to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment we must be able to provide clients with investment returns and service that will encourage them to be willing to pay such fees  accordingly there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure  fee reductions on existing or future new business could have an adverse impact on our profit margins and results of operations   risks related to the company   the disparity in the voting rights among the classes of shares may have a potential adverse effect on the price of our class a common stock   the holders of class a common stock and class b common stock have identical rights except that i holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by shareholders in general and ii holders of class a common stock are not eligible to vote on matters relating exclusively to class b common stock and vice versa  the differential in voting rights and the ability of our company to issue additional class b common stock could adversely affect the value of the class a common stock to the extent the investors or any potential future purchaser of our company view the superior voting rights of the class b common stock to have value   future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or sales or distributions of our class b commons stock could lower our stock price and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute our stockholders’ ownership in us   we may sell additional shares of class a common stock in subsequent public offerings we also may issue additional shares of class a common stock or convertible debt securities as of december   we had  outstanding shares of class a common stock on september   a shelf registration statement on form s was declared effective by the sec for the resale of up to  class a shares                                                  no prediction can be made as to the effect if any that future sales or distributions of class b common stock owned by ggcp will have on the market price of the class a common stock prevailing from time to time   sales or distributions of substantial amounts of class a or class b common stock  or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur could adversely affect the prevailing market price for the class a common stock   we reported two material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in   failure to properly remediate these material weaknesses could negatively impact our business and the price of our common stock   we concluded that these material weaknesses existed in our internal control over financial reporting  first there was a material weakness relating to the reporting of individual assets and liabilities of certain proprietary investment accounts in the consolidated financial statements  next there was a material weakness relating to the evaluation of and accounting for certain nonroutine transactions in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles   we have remediated the first material weakness by implementing a new procedure to review the accounting treatment for all of the company’s
