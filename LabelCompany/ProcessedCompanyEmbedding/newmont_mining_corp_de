governor brian sandoval replaced his director of taxation citing problems in auditing tax deductions statements by both nevada mining association president tim crowley and republican assembly minority floor leader pete goicoechea of eureka county in nevada the county where a majority of newmonts nevada operations are located made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper this prompted the state legislature to call for emergency regulations to disallow some tax deductions in april  it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions which had been approved by the nevada tax commission the outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years this is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees such as robert j miller who served a director of newmont mining corporation right after being governor of nevada for a decadenot in citation given miller was succeeded by the late kenny guinn who proposed a tax restructuring during the  legislative session that was met with opposition from antitax business groups and many antitax republicanscitation needed fin  an interpretation of fasb  requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities or litigation the th session of the nevada legislature  passed senate bill  over opposition from the mining industry senate bill  creates the mining oversight and accountability commission a sevenmember panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation an amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections if you don’t let us deduct this we’ll deduct something else a newmont mining corp staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction saying employee housing cut travel costs

collapsed in  after brgm tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an australian company which was a rival of newmont newmont and buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade larry kurlander then a senior executive at newmont claimed the french president jacques chirac had sent a letter to then peruvian president alberto fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the french owned company kurlander had been sent by newmont to peru to try to get a favorable outcome for newmont in the dispute the legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the peruvian supreme court during this period kurlander acknowledges having met with vladimiro montesinos the peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief abuse of power influence peddling and bribing tv stations   however kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the french government were taking similar steps in trying to contact montesinos the french ambassador to peru antoine blanca denies this pointing to the fact that montesinos was on the cia payroll and thus would naturally side with the usbased company after the fall of fujimori in  a number of videos montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged in october  frontline in coproduction with the new york times found a february  recording of a telephone conversation between montesinos and kurlander the following is an excerpt from the tape kurlanderwe have a very serious problem in peru with our company newmont and minera buenaventura so i have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities i need it especially because the other side the french government has been acting quite strangely montesinos to interpreter tell him that i am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the french as well as the problem he has with the judiciary kurlander so now you have a friend for life i want a friend for life montesinos to interpreter i thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend tell him im going to help him with the voting i would like to know the tricky practices of the french the french connection kurlander the french connection laughter  along with this telephone conversation frontline and the new york times also rebroadcast three other videos one was filmed in april  and shows montesinos talking to don arabian the cia station chief in peru in an attempt to get cia to pressure the us to back newmont in the case in the video montesinos claims to have found emails from paris to peru of french officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to france another video recorded in may  shows montesinos meeting with peruvian supreme court justice and former classmate jaime beltran quiroga in it montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between newmont and brgm he tells quiroga that if the decision goes to newmont that the united states will back peru in its border dispute with ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the cenepa war he also tells quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case his vote would be the deciding vote in the newmont victory after the video was first broadcast in peru in  on a peruvian local television station the french ambassador antoine blanca was quoted as saying now i know why newmont won in the final july  video montesinos is again seen with the now departing cia station chief don arabian giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given

deductionsedit in march  nevada governor brian sandoval replaced his director of taxation citing problems in auditing tax deductions statements by both nevada mining association president tim crowley and republican assembly minority floor leader pete goicoechea of eureka county in nevada the county where a majority of newmonts nevada operations are located made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper this prompted the state legislature to call for emergency regulations to disallow some tax deductions in april  it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions which had been approved by the nevada tax commission the outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years this is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees such as robert j miller who served a director of newmont mining corporation right after being governor of nevada for a decadenot in citation given miller was succeeded by the late kenny guinn who proposed a tax restructuring during the  legislative session that was met with opposition from antitax business groups and many antitax republicanscitation needed fin  an interpretation of fasb  requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities or litigation the th session of the nevada legislature  passed senate bill  over opposition from the mining industry senate bill  creates the mining oversight and accountability commission a sevenmember panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation an amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections if you don’t let us deduct this we’ll deduct something else a newmont mining corp staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction saying employee housing cut travel costs  the mines in nevada were to report their deductions to the mining oversight and accountability commission which was created under sb citation needed batu hijau mine

embezzlement illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief abuse of power influence peddling and bribing tv stations   however kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the french government were taking similar steps in trying to contact montesinos the french ambassador to peru antoine blanca denies this pointing to the fact that montesinos was on the cia payroll and thus would

intelligence communities i need it especially because the other side the french government has been acting quite strangely montesinos to interpreter tell him that i am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the french as well as the problem he has with the judiciary kurlander so now you have a friend for life i want a friend for life montesinos to interpreter i thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend tell him im going to help him with the voting i would like to know the tricky practices of the french the french connection kurlander the french connection laughter  along with this telephone conversation frontline and the new york times also rebroadcast three other videos one was filmed in april  and shows montesinos talking to don arabian the cia station chief in peru in an attempt to get cia to pressure the us to back newmont in the case in the video montesinos claims to have found emails from paris to peru of french officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to france another video recorded in may  shows montesinos meeting with peruvian supreme court justice and former classmate jaime beltran quiroga in it montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between newmont and brgm he tells quiroga that if the decision goes to newmont that the united states will back peru in its border dispute with ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the cenepa war he also tells quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case his vote would be the deciding vote in the newmont victory after the video was first broadcast in peru in  on a peruvian local television station the french ambassador antoine blanca was quoted as saying now i know why newmont won in the final july  video montesinos is again seen with the now departing cia station chief don arabian giving him a gift and thanking him

deductionsedit in march  nevada governor brian sandoval replaced his director of taxation citing problems in auditing tax deductions statements by both nevada mining association president tim crowley and republican assembly minority floor leader pete goicoechea of eureka county in nevada the county where a majority of newmonts nevada operations are located made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper this prompted the state legislature to call for emergency regulations to disallow some tax deductions in april  it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions which had been approved by the nevada tax commission the outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years this is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees such as robert j miller who served a director of newmont mining corporation right after being governor of nevada for a decadenot in citation given miller was succeeded by the late kenny guinn who proposed a tax restructuring during the  legislative session that was met with opposition from antitax business groups and many antitax republicanscitation needed fin  an interpretation of fasb  requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities or litigation the th session of the nevada legislature  passed senate bill  over opposition from the mining industry senate bill  creates the mining oversight and accountability commission a sevenmember panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation an amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections if you don’t let us deduct this we’ll deduct something else a newmont mining corp staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction saying employee housing cut travel costs  the mines in nevada were to report their deductions to the mining oversight and accountability commission which was created under sb citation needed batu hijau mine

embezzlement illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief abuse of power influence peddling and bribing tv stations   however kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the french government were taking similar steps in trying to contact montesinos the french ambassador to peru antoine blanca denies this pointing to the fact that montesinos was on the cia payroll and thus would

accepting them had emerged in october  frontline in coproduction with the new york times found a february  recording of a telephone conversation between montesinos and kurlander the following is an

intelligence communities i need it especially because the other side the french government has been acting quite strangely montesinos to interpreter tell him that i am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the french as well as the problem he has with the judiciary kurlander so now you have a friend for life i want a friend for life montesinos to interpreter i thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend tell him im going to help him with the voting i would like to know the tricky practices of the french the french connection kurlander the french connection laughter  along with this telephone conversation frontline and the new york times also rebroadcast three other videos one was filmed in april  and shows montesinos talking to don arabian the cia station chief in peru in an attempt to get cia to pressure the us to back newmont in the case in the video montesinos claims to have found emails from paris

classmate jaime beltran quiroga in it montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between newmont and brgm he tells quiroga that if the decision goes to newmont that the united states will back peru in its border dispute with ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the cenepa war he also tells quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case his vote would be the deciding vote in the newmont victory after the video was first broadcast in peru in  on a peruvian local television station the french ambassador antoine blanca was quoted as saying now i know why newmont won in the final july  video montesinos is again seen with the now departing cia station chief don arabian giving him a gift and thanking him

and republican assembly minority floor leader pete goicoechea of eureka county in nevada the county where a majority of newmonts nevada operations are located made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper this prompted the state legislature to call for emergency regulations to disallow some tax deductions in april  it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions which had been approved by the nevada tax commission the outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years this is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees such as robert j miller who served a director of newmont mining corporation

opposition from antitax business groups and many antitax republicanscitation needed fin  an interpretation of fasb  requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and

opposition from the mining industry senate bill  creates the mining oversight and accountability commission a sevenmember panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation an amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections if you don’t let us deduct this we’ll deduct something else a newmont mining corp staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction saying

embezzlement illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief abuse of power influence peddling and bribing tv stations   however kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the french government were taking similar steps in trying to contact montesinos the french ambassador to peru antoine blanca denies this pointing to the fact that montesinos was on the cia payroll and thus would

accepting them had emerged in october  frontline in coproduction with the new york times found a february  recording of a telephone conversation between montesinos and kurlander the following is an excerpt from the tape kurlanderwe have a very serious problem in peru with our company newmont and minera buenaventura so i have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities i need it especially because the other side the french government has been acting quite strangely montesinos to interpreter tell him that i am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the french as well as the problem he has with the judiciary kurlander so now you have a friend for life i want a friend for life montesinos to interpreter i thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend tell him im going to help him with the voting i would like to know the tricky practices of the french the french connection kurlander the french connection laughter  along with this telephone conversation frontline and the new york times also rebroadcast three other videos one was filmed in april  and shows montesinos talking to don arabian the cia station chief in peru in an attempt to get cia to pressure the us to back newmont in the case in the video montesinos claims to have found emails from paris to peru of french officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to france another video recorded in may  shows montesinos meeting with peruvian supreme court justice and former classmate jaime beltran quiroga in it montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between newmont and brgm he tells quiroga that if the decision goes to newmont that the united states will back peru in its border dispute with ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the cenepa war he also tells quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case his vote would be the deciding vote in the newmont victory after the video was first broadcast in peru in  on a peruvian local television station the french ambassador antoine blanca was quoted as saying now i know why newmont won in the final july  video montesinos is again seen with the now departing cia station chief don arabian giving him a gift and thanking him

deductionsedit in march  nevada governor brian sandoval replaced his director of taxation citing problems in auditing tax deductions statements by both nevada mining association president tim crowley and republican assembly minority floor leader pete goicoechea of eureka county in nevada the county where a majority of newmonts nevada operations are located made it more plausible that the deductions approved by state regulators may have been improper this prompted the state legislature to call for emergency regulations to disallow some tax deductions in april  it was revealed that the mining industry had taken questionable state tax deductions which had been approved by the nevada tax commission the outgoing state director of taxation said that his department had no one trained to audit mining companies for the past two years this is shown also in the close ties between regulators and industry employees such as robert j miller who served a director of newmont mining corporation right after being governor of nevada for a decadenot in citation given miller was succeeded by the late kenny guinn who proposed a tax restructuring during the  legislative session that was met with opposition from antitax business groups and many antitax republicanscitation needed fin  an interpretation of fasb  requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities or litigation the th session of the nevada legislature  passed senate bill  over opposition from the mining industry senate bill  creates the mining oversight and accountability commission a sevenmember panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation an amendment to the measure also eliminated the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections if you don’t let us deduct this we’ll deduct something else a newmont mining corp staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction saying

all the way up to the peruvian supreme court during this period kurlander acknowledges having met with vladimiro montesinos the peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief abuse of power influence peddling and bribing tv stations   however kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the french government were taking similar steps in trying to contact montesinos the french ambassador to peru antoine blanca denies this pointing to the fact that montesinos was on the cia payroll and thus would naturally side with the usbased company after the fall of fujimori in  a number of videos montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged in october  frontline in coproduction with the new york times found a february  recording of a telephone conversation between montesinos and kurlander the following is an excerpt from the tape kurlanderwe have a very serious problem in peru with our company newmont and minera buenaventura so i have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities i need it especially because the other side the french government has been acting quite strangely montesinos to interpreter tell him that i am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the french as well as the problem he has with the judiciary kurlander so now you have a friend for life i want a friend for life montesinos to interpreter i thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend tell him im going to help him with the voting i would like to know the tricky practices of the french the french connection kurlander the french connection laughter  along with this telephone conversation frontline and the new york times also rebroadcast three other videos one was filmed in april  and shows montesinos talking to don arabian the cia station chief in peru in an attempt to get cia to pressure the us to back newmont in the case in the video montesinos claims to have found emails from paris to peru of french officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to france another video recorded in may  shows montesinos meeting with peruvian supreme court justice and former classmate jaime beltran quiroga in it montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between newmont and brgm he tells quiroga that if the decision goes to newmont that the united states will back peru in its border dispute with ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the cenepa war he also tells quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case his vote would be the deciding vote in the newmont victory after the video was first broadcast in peru in  on a peruvian local television station the french ambassador antoine blanca was quoted as saying now i know why newmont won in the final july  video montesinos is again seen with the now departing cia station chief don arabian giving him a gift and thanking him
