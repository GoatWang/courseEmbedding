settle annuities suit for  million march    comments share by bruce vielmetti of the journal sentinel march    northwestern mutual life insurance co has agreed to pay  million to settle a longrunning class action lawsuit over changes the company made to annuities it sold before  about  current and  former owners of the product will be eligible to share in the settlement of a case that could have carried a much higher price tag if a jury ultimately believed the plaintiffs theory this lawsuit was a case of a small group of customers seeking more than their fair share of dividends which would have come at the expense of all our other policyowners said betsy hoylman director of public relations for northwestern mutual we are proud of the significant dividends we have paid to this group over the years and believe our actions have been right fair and in the best interest of all of our policyowners including these annuity owners hoylman said the company decided it was in everyones interest to avoid continued costs of litigation and the uncertainty of the legal process george kersten one of the lead plaintiff lawyers called the agreement a fair resolution of a very complex case he said it was especially beneficial to the majority of class members in or approaching retirement the minimum award is  and others could be thousand of dollars depending on the size of the annuities held and when they were held based on a complex formula kersten said a national firm will administer the notice and claims processing for about  and the legal fees are capped at  of the  million the proposed settlement must still win final approval from us district judge lynn adelman that could happen by the end of summer a fort atkinson woman marleen laplant contends that in  northwestern mutual improperly changed the way it paid people who had purchased annuities from the company without notice to or permission from the buyers resulting in their loss of dividend income over the next  years the company says the change was a normal part of business the plaintiffs continued to receive what were called dividends but contend that they were merely interest payments from shortterm bonds into which the company had switched the annuity assets the original contracts plaintiffs claim called for annuity holders to share in a surplus generated by northwestern mutuals general portfolio — something that did extremely well in recent years including a record  billion in dividends for  the clients were counting on the companys promise and reputation for longterm strength their lawyer argued at an early trial in the case they thought they would prosper as the company prospered kersten told a judge according to court records the proposed settlement resulted from months of mediatorassisted negotiation longrunning case the case took some dramatic turns through state and federal court before the settlement a lengthy trial was held in  in milwaukee county circuit court before a retired racine county judge who later ruled for the plaintiffs in a page order that was highly critical of northwestern mutual reserve judge dennis flynn found the firm had breached contracts with the annuity holders and also breached its fiduciary duty as well as duties of good faith fair dealing and loyalty intentional and repeated concealment of wrongdoing over a period of a quarter century took place flynn wrote the decision stunned the company which then tried to have flynn removed from the case and all his decisions on the matter thrown out claiming it had recently discovered flynn himself briefly owned some of the annuities in question flynn said he had no memory of the investments and suggested it was the defense lawyers ethics that should be examined for not bringing the issue up earlier northwestern mutual then moved the case to federal court after the plaintiffs tried to expand the class to annuity holders nationwide not just those in wisconsin adelman initially sent the case back to state court but a federal appeals court sided with northwestern mutual in  a nearly identical lawsuit was filed against northwestern mutual six years earlier before laplant in  but got bogged down in its own furious litigation and never went to trial another lawsuit pending milwaukee county circuit judge daniel noonan and his wife bought similar annuities their lawsuit came a couple months after northwestern mutual had announced a recordbreaking dividend payout of  billion the couple claimed the company had breached its contracts and its fiduciary duty to annuity holders according to the settlement records the noonan case remains pending in wisconsin state court similar class action claims in other states would be part of the proposed settlement about bruce vielmetti

acceptable to us if a purchase payment is not paid when due or if we decline to accept a purchase payment as provided above the contract will continue in force unless you redeem all accumulation units for their value you may resume payment of purchase payments at any time the contract is in force application of purchase payments we credit net purchase payments to your contract after deduction of any sales load or installation fee and we allocate the payments as you direct to the extent that you direct a net purchase payment to accumulate on a variable basis we place it in the account and allocate it to one or more divisions assets we allocate to each division we thereupon invest in shares of the portfolio or fund which corresponds to that division if we receive no allocation instructions we will place the net purchase payment in the money market division we apply payments we place in the account to provide accumulation units in one or more divisions accumulation units represent your interest in the account the number of accumulation units provided by each net purchase payment is determined by dividing the amount to be allocated to a division by the value of an accumulation unit in that division based upon the next valuation of the assets of the division we make after we receive your purchase payment at our home office we will also accept your purchase payment if you send it to a lockbox facility we have designated we value assets as of the close of trading on the new york stock exchange for each day the exchange is open the number of your accumulation units will be increased by additional purchase payments and decreased by withdrawals the investment experience of the account does not change the number as distinguished from the value of your accumulation units the value of an accumulation unit in each division varies with the investment experience of the division this in turn is determined by the investment experience of the corresponding portfolio or fund we determine the value of an accumulation unit on any date by multiplying the value on the immediately preceding valuation date by the net investment factor for the division for the current period see net investment factor p  since you bear the investment risk there is no guarantee as to the aggregate value of your accumulation unit that value may be less than equal to or more than the cumulative net purchase payments you have made net investment factor for each division the net investment factor for any period ending on a valuation date is  plus the net investment rate for the division for that period under the contract the net investment rate is related to the assets of the division however since all amounts are simultaneously invested in shares of the corresponding portfolio or fund when allocated to the division calculation of the net investment rate for each of the divisions may also be based upon the change in value of a single share of the corresponding portfolio or fund thus for example in the case of the balanced division the net investment rate is equal to a the change in the net asset  account c prospectus

payments are either paid in substantially equal installments over the life or life expectancy of the employee or are paid on account of early retirement after age  we will determine the amount required to pay the annuity or cash benefits and will redeem accumulation units in that amount there is no assurance that amounts accumulated under the contract will be sufficient to provide the retirement benefits under the plan or trust variable payment plans we will pay part or all of the benefits under a contract under a variable payment plan you select under a variable plan the payee bears the entire investment risk since no guarantees of investment return are made accordingly there is no guarantee of the amount of the variable payments and you must expect the amount of such payments to change from month to month under a variable payment plan an annuitant must select the initial allocation of variable benefits among the divisions the annuitant may name and change the beneficiaries of unpaid payments for the specified period under plan  or the certain period under plans  or  we will issue the annuitant a certificate describing the variable annuity benefits and

pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th adjusted age we will calculate the amount of the first annuity payment on a basis that takes into account the length of time over which we expect annuity payments to continue the first payment will be lower for an annuitant who is younger when payments begin and higher for an annuitant who is older if the payment plan involves life contingencies the first payment will be lower if the payment plan includes a longer certain period variable annuity payments after the first will vary from month to month and will depend upon the

the contracts are based upon an assumed investment rate of   payment rate tables based upon an assumed investment rate of  are also available where permitted by state law the assumed investment rate affects both the amount of the first variable payment and the amount by which subsequent payments increase or decrease the assumed investment rate does not affect the actual value of the future payments as of the date when payments begin over a period of time if each division achieved a net investment result exactly equal to the assumed investment rate applicable to a particular payment plan the annuity unit for each division would not change in value and the amount of annuity payments would be level however if the division achieved a net investment result greater than the assumed investment rate the amount of annuity payments would increase similarly if the division achieved a net investment result smaller than the assumed investment rate the amount of annuity payments would decrease a higher assumed investment rate will result in a larger initial payment but more slowly rising and more rapidly falling subsequent payments than a lower assumed investment rate additional information transfers between divisions and payment plans you may change the allocation of net purchase payments among the divisions or transfer accumulation units from one division to another at any time after the effective date of a variable payment plan the annuitant may transfer annuity units from one division to another changes in allocation and transfers are effective on the date we receive a written request at our home office or on a future specified date we will adjust the number of accumulation or annuity units to be credited to reflect the respective value of the accumulation and annuity units in each of the divisions you may transfer accumulation units among the divisions up to twelve times in a contract year without charge the charge for each additional transfer is  we may set charges and waiting periods for transfers of annuity units if you contemplate the transfer of funds from one division to another you should consider the risk inherent in a switch from one investment medium to another in general frequent transfers based on shortterm expectations for the securities markets especially transfers of large sums will tend to accentuate the danger that a transfer will be made at an inopportune time frequent transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the assets of the portfolio or fund in which a division invests may also be disruptive and
