directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

tenyear treasury yields which were around  percent in march  rose above  percent by november as the federal reserve pushed rates higher in an effort to cut short inflation however as inflation fears ebbed at yearend treasury yields fell back to  percent by march  high yield bonds carry a higher degree of investment risk while the principal and interest of treasury issues are guaranteed by the us government high yield bonds are considered speculative because they present greater risks of price volatility and default with a stronger economy credit quality improved within the high yield sector according to securities data corp issues rated b or below comprised  percent of new high yield issuance in  that is a significant improvement from  when nearly  percent of new debt was rated b or below in addition interest coverage for new high yield issues  the ratio of free cash flow to interest payments  rose from  percent at the beginning of  to  percent by the yearend according to chemical securities inc that statistic indicates a widening comfort margin for purchasers of high yield debt and another sign of the improving credit quality of the  billion high yield market in the

portfolio manager of eaton vance income fund of boston q hooker how would you evaluate the funds performance during the sixmonth period a the fund performed relatively well during the sixmonth period the principal reason for the funds positive performance was that our focus remained on highcoupon bonds which avoided much of the volatility that characterized the treasury market through much of  another reason for the funds performance was an emphasis on cyclical issues which have been the clear market leaders q what recent changes have you made to the portfolio a after an extended recovery the economy has recently showed signs of slowing somewhat therefore i have reduced the portfolios exposure to earlycycle industries such as home builders and automobiles while those companies have fared well they have seen sales decline modestly in recent months meanwhile weve increased the portfolios positions in latestage cyclicals such as chemicals energy companies and paper and packaging companies in addition since the beginning of the year we have moved into some more defensive issues such as cable television casinos and food companies q would a sustained stablegrowth economy be favorable for the high yield market a in my view it would if interest rates remain stable we should see continued improvement in earnings which would support interest payments for debt service and help sustain principal payments q what industries will benefit a if the economy maintains a slow but steady course for an extended period the late cyclical companies that we have emphasized would very likely continue to prosper many latecycle companies are beneficiaries of increased capital spending and higher commodity prices that accompany an advancing economic cycle q can you give an example a chemical companies are a good example the industry is expected to operate near  percent of capacity in  an improvement over  which was another strong year yet even with the increased capacity chemical producers may still be hardpressed to meet rising demand according to the chemical manufacturers association industry sales could rise as much as  percent in  two portfolio holdings nl industries and agricultural minerals  chemicals have each been able to raise prices while benefiting from the widescale cost cutting of recent years nl industries makes titanium dioxide a pigmentation chemical used in the manufacture of paints and plastics agricultural minerals produces specialty chemicals including nitrogen fertilizers used in the agriculture sector q the dollar has weakened significantly in recent months against the yen and the deutschmark what kind of impact might that have on cyclical companies a that surely helps the global competitiveness of us manufacturers relative to their counterparts abroad but while the weaker dollar may help marginally the primary driver by far has been strong global economic growth cyclical companies have been helped by an economic revival in europe as well as the growth in some emerging markets american standard for instance a longtime portfolio holding has substantial operations in europe in their plumbing and transportation businesses the company should see significant growth in sales to the expanding markets in europe q you mentioned adding some defensive issues to the portfolio could you expand on that theme a certainly adding some defensive names to the portfolio nicely complements our late cyclical strategy as i indicated earlier its impossible to consistently predict turns in the economy if the fed is a bit overzealous in combating inflation the economy could slow significantly in that event defensive issues would benefit for example the unit volumes and pricing of food retailers like food  less supermarkets a large portfolio investment are fairly immune from the fluctuations in the economy that stability serves the companies well in a slower economic environment and they in turn tend to attract the attention of investors q hooker what is your outlook for the high yield market a with an upbeat economic picture the high yield market should continue to fare well the economy currently enjoys a climate of moderate growth neither weak enough to risk recession nor strong enough to prompt a resurgence of inflation meanwhile year bbrated bonds currently offer a premium of  basis points over year treasuries a very attractive yield advantage while past trends are not always repeated high yield bonds have been among the bestperforming assets classes during the s and i believe the high yield sector continues to represent a major opportunity for investors seeking high current income photo of hooker talcott jr hooker talcott jr pndrd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd  portfolio of

of  for the same period the global economic recovery provided a lift to the emerging markets during the fiscal year with the global economy gaining renewed momentum in late  and early  many emerging markets turned in robust performances the rally was sparked by an uptrend in worldwide industrial activity and a rise in capital spending this trend notably benefited exporters of machinery and technologyrelated products the continued economic surge in china and india was an especially strong catalyst for growth in asia meanwhile oil exporting nations benefited from the dramatic rise in oil prices while the economic tide appeared to have turned positive geopolitical trends remained a concern to emerging market investors the conflict in iraq the ongoing threat of terrorism and concerns over corporate property rights in russia tempered investors enthusiasm as the fiscal year drew to a close investors also watched for rising interest rates which could impact the availability of capital the lifeblood of economic expansion diversification among emerging markets in a taxmanaged approach the past year has demonstrated the compelling opportunities that can be found in the emerging markets but as impressive as the years returns have been the impact of taxes on ones investment remains an important consideration a funds taxmanagement can be a critical determinant to its

cliff quisenberry portfolio manager an interview with cliff quisenberry director of research and product development parametric portfolio associates and portfolio manager of taxmanaged emerging markets fund q cliff how would you characterize the investment climate for the emerging markets in recent months a recent months have seen the apparent culmination of a rally phase in the emerging markets a rally that began in april  and ended in april  since then weve seen the beginning of a new phase in the cycle in which returns have been more modest as emerging markets face the challenges of risinginterest rates rising oil prices and renewed fears of world instability while the recovery in world economic growth has benefited the emerging markets and longterm prospects remain sound these markets are keenly sensitive to a rise in the cost of capital in addition there is the risk that rising oil prices may threaten the recovery we have seen in the developed economies and thus impact emerging economies via exports q how were the funds investments weighted among the emerging markets a the fund utilizes a disciplined structure with regard to country weighting and sector weighting within countries the funds regional weightings at june   as a percentage of net assets were asia at  latin america at  europe at  and middle eastafrica at  the funds largest country weightings were south africa mexico brazil south korea and russia from an industry perspective we maintained an exposure across a broad range of major economic sectors with an emphasis on industrial companies consumerrelated companies financial services providers and energy companies q how would you evaluate the funds performance during the year a the fund has performed well generally in line with expectations at this phase of the cycle in the year ended june   the fund had a total return of  outperforming its benchmark the spinternational finance corp investable emerging market index which returned  the fund also outperformed the morgan stanley capital international emerging markets free index a major emerging markets index which returned  five largest country weightings  as a

directly in an index pncsrth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th eaton vance taxmanaged emerging markets fund as of june   management discussion contd the funds outperformance relative to its benchmark was especially noteworthy in the closing months of the fiscal year as the emerging market rally began to flag this was not surprising given the funds more diverse approach to country allocation this country structure emphasizes smaller markets that have tended to lag their larger counterparts in the beginning phase of a rally but which have often outperformed as the rally loses its momentum as it has in recent months q what countries were particularly additive to performance during the period a during the year ending june   the fund outperformed its benchmark by  basis points  the funds overweights relative to the benchmark in the eastern european countries such as hungary poland and czech republic contributed to this outperformance those markets were some of the best performers among all emerging markets in the period as they benefited from their entrance into the european union in may  in addition the fund benefited from its exposure to the middle easternafrican countries of egypt ghana and botswana which outperformed the overall emerging markets benchmark in that period q were there any countries that did not perform quite as well for the fund a yes the funds relative returns were hampered by its exposure to argentina malaysia indonesia and the philippines while all of these countries posted positive returns they underperformed the emerging markets as a whole q you indicated that the funds exposure to smaller country markets resisted the emerging market correction later in the period could you expand on that thought a yes in periods of weakness the funds broader more balanced structure has often provided relative stability when compared to its capitalization weighted benchmark which is more heavily concentrated in a handful of larger emerging market countries these larger markets have tended to correlate more to developed markets like the us and have followed them as they hit the downward cycle of a rally on the other hand the fund emphasizes smaller emerging countries which historically have not only been less correlated to major developed markets but have also tended to move more independently than their larger counterparts this can provide additional diversification that can help dampen volatility in a down market emerging markets have had an impressive run in the four quarters leading up to the second quarter of  and thus we expected such weakness in this quarter q your primary focus at parametric is managing investments with tax considerations in mind could you discuss that issue a tax management is an important and explicit part of the investment process in this fund we utilize tax lot accounting in the fund to try to minimize gains or maximize losses when selling positions driven by our investment process or to fund withdrawals  it is not possible to invest directly in an index  the views expressed in this report are those of the portfolio manager and are current only through the end

often identify and sell security lots with unrealized losses in order to harvest realized losses while making offsetting purchases in other securities to maintain exposure to a country or sector this type of tax management has allowed the fund to avoid distributing realized capital gains historically and has provided a loss carryforward that can help reduce future realized gains that might otherwise be distributed  comparison of change in value of a  investment in eaton vance taxmanaged emerging markets fund class i vs the standard  poorsinternational finance corp investable emerging

principally traded marketable securities listed in the nasdaq national market system are valued at the nasdaq official closing price unlisted or listed securities for which closing sales prices are not available are valued at the mean between the latest bid and asked prices or in the case of preferred equity securities that are not listed or traded in the overthecounter market by an independent pricing service an option is valued at the last sale price as quoted on the principal exchange or board of trade on which such option or contract is traded or in the absence of a sale at the mean between the last bid and asked prices futures positions on securities or currencies are generally valued at closing settlement prices shortterm debt securities with a remaining maturity of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates value other fixed income and debt securities including listed securities and securities for which price quotations are available will normally be valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a pricing service the daily valuation of foreign securities generally is determined as of the close of trading on the principal exchange on which such securities trade events occurring after the close of trading on foreign exchanges may result in adjustments to the valuation of foreign securities to more accurately reflect their fair value as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange the fund may rely on an independent fair valuation service in adjusting the valuations of foreign securities foreign securities and currencies are valued in us dollars based on foreign currency exchange rate quotations supplied by an independent quotation service investments held by the fund for which valuations or market quotations are

federal income tax purposes had a capital loss carryover of  which will reduce the funds taxable income arising from future net realized gain on investments if any to the extent permitted by the internal revenue code and thus will reduce the amount of distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the fund of any liability for federal income or excise tax such capital loss carryover will expire june    june    june    june    june    and june    additionally at june   the fund had net capital losses of  attributable to security transactions incurred after

the terms of their contracts and from movements in the value of a foreign currency relative to the us dollar the fund will enter into forward contracts for hedging purposes the forward foreign currency exchange contracts are adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the underlying currency and any gains or losses are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized until such time as the contracts have been closed or offset g purchase and redemption fees  the fund imposes a fee equal to  of the net asset value of shares purchased exchanged or redeemed to defray the funds

business activities are outside the united states may involve significant risks not present in domestic investments for example there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies particularly those not subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements of the us securities laws foreign issuers are generally not bound by uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting requirements and standards of practice comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers investments in foreign securities also involve the risk of possible adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations expropriation or confiscatory taxation limitation on the removal of funds or other assets of the fund political or financial instability or diplomatic and other developments which could affect such investments foreign stock markets while growing in volume and sophistication are generally not as developed as those in the united states and securities of some foreign issuers particularly those in developing countries may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable us companies in general there is less overall governmental supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets brokerdealers and issuers than in the united states  financial instruments  the fund may trade in financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure to various market risks these financial instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts and futures contracts and may involve to a varying degree elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes the notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment the fund has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk the measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered at june   there were no obligations outstanding under these financial instruments  reorganization  on
