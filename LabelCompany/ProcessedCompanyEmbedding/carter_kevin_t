blog photo gallery    this is a beautiful way to top off your fuel injection project  the intent was to make a four barrel throttle body that flows well and isnt the typical chunky billet  these  bbl flanged billet  aluminum throttle bodies are cnc machined on a  axis machining center in lenoir city tn  they are then polished and buffed by hand before assembly  they have been designed using cfd software to reduce slow moving boundary layers and turbulence  the integrated throttle position sensor uses reliable one million cycle panasonic internals  this eliminates the large plastic tps﻿ hanging off the side  the linkage is variable to allow the user to decide if the operation should be more or less progressive  the shafts are mounted on double sealed ina roller bearings rated to turn k rpm  one prototype was cycled  times on a computer monitored test stand before logging thousands of trouble  free miles in a daily driven test vehicle  they should work with any aftermarket multiport computer that allows calibration of the throttle position sensor  thankskevin carter billet  barrel throttle body   replacement tps sensor   throttle return springs   high flow  barrels
