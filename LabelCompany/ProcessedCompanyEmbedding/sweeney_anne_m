a consistently clearsighted and forthright advisor on a range of issues extending far beyond the usual purview of development and alumni relations according to trustee chair david j stern who chaired the second half of the extended campaign for columbia working with anne has been a real pleasure she is smart and she is tough and her success attests to the value of taking the direct approach i
