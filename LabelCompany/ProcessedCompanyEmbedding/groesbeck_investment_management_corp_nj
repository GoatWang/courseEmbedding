adviser providing equity portfolio management services to endowments foundations pension plans trusts tafthartley accounts ira’s and high net worth individuals  since our founding in  we’ve provided abovemarket investment performance through a disciplined risksensitive process   our investment styles groesbeck investment management offers two distinct equity portfolio management investment strategies depending on the client’s requirements and objectives  our growth of income style seeks to provide a growing stream of current income and a total return in excess of the sp   our growth style seeks to generate higher than market returns primarily through capital appreciation  the investment processes of these two portfolio management strategies are summarized below growth of income strategy our philosophy toward growth of income investing is to seek abovemarket portfolio returns through investment in securities of companies that our analysis indicates have the ability to increase earnings and dividends at a faster rate than their industry group andor the stock market  we construct diversified portfolios of stocks that include both growth and income characteristics  the inclusion of highyielding growth equity issues allows us to invest in growthoriented stocks at lower dividend yields and still obtain an overall portfolio income yield that is well above that of the general stock market  in addition this process leads to dividend income growth that is faster than that of corporate dividend growth in general and is significantly faster than the consumer price inflation rate we start with higherthanmarket yield and stress growth of portfolio income at a rate faster than that of the market averages  portfolio income growth is accomplished in two ways  first we select companies that should experience relatively rapid dividend growth rates and target companies that we believe will increase dividends every year  second we augment this growing stream of income by periodically switching from lower yielding equities to higher yielding issues in order to raise the portfolio income level  in this manner we can increase the income while also moving from relatively overvalued lower yield to relatively undervalued higher yield issues growth strategy our approach toward growth investing is to select the stocks of companies which we believe have aboveaverage earnings growth prospects  we purchase the stocks of companies whose future earnings growth is estimated to be at least  annually  companies selected must meet our standards for financial strength profitability and sustainability of future growth  we pay particular attention to revenue growth because we believe the only sustainable growth comes from increased revenues rather than simply through profit margin improvement  as part of the valuation process stock purchases are made at priceearnings ratios that bear a reasonable relationship to the anticipated future rate of earnings growth  the ratio of stock price to trailing twelve month revenues per share is also part of our analysis once a growth portfolio is constructed we continuously monitor the earnings progress of each company in the portfolio  companies that fail to meet our earnings growth expectations will normally be sold and replaced with stocks that meet our investment criteria  we believe that successful growth investing requires a portfolio earnings stream that is growing at abovemarket rates  by constantly pruning those issues that fail to meet our expectations the portfolio will remain vibrant and should experience satisfactory earnings growth over the long term at groesbeck you will find us to be client friendly flexible and devoted to our investment discipline  we work closely

that the most reliable methods of fundamental research are based on facts rather than forecasts  we pay close attention to a companys revenues trailing earnings from operations dividends return on equity and balance sheet  to us forecasted earnings by wall street are only opinions dividends and reported operating earnings are facts stock selection the key to producing strong returns begins with stock selection at groesbeck we use a variety of sources to conduct stock research and generate investment ideas  electronic research is conducted through use of the internet computer screening of financial databases and a variety of websites devoted to the stock market and equity research in addition we use the equity research web capabilities of some wall street brokerage houses we do our own homework on securities under consideration and those already owned in looking for investment candidates we focus on the equity securities of companies that have the following characteristics strong sales and earnings growth consistent annual growth trends   sound balance sheets high returns on equity good longterm financial track records market leadership with growing market share high trading liquidity reasonable valuations on an absolute and relative basis portfolio construction  maintenance once we have found stocks that meet our investment criteria we then build fully invested portfolios consisting of  to  stocks diversified across a broad spectrum of industries positions are routinely rebalanced in order to prevent any one position from becoming top heavy moreover we also trim positions as they become fully valued and seek to replace them with more moderately valued stocks  by continually monitoring portfolios and constantly seeking new stock ideas we create portfolios that remain vibrant  at groesbeck we do not engage in any fad investing shortterm trading market timing derivatives or short selling sell discipline just as stock selection and sound portfolio maintenance are necessary to achieve strong returns a sell discipline is equally important in monitoring our clients portfolios we sell stocks that exhibit the following characteristics slowing sales growth and earnings growth poor earnings prospects declining margins diminishing fundamentals slowing dividend growth or reduction of dividends overvaluation   in summary our disciplined approach assures that we remain fully invested and that we seek to own quality companies whose earnings are growing and which should provide higherthanmarket stock price appreciation over the long haul  our investment process also results in portfolios with relatively low turnover and minimal tax implications  we remain committed to our investment process and to providing excellent client service main
