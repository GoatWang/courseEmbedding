feature saved added to saved content remove  download pdf as the recent market crisis unfolded one area of the private equity landscape that commentators suggested would inadvertently benefit from market conditions was secondary funds and their limited partners the reality to date however has been different with very few transactions clearing the market at the time of writing due to a continued dislocation between buyers’ and sellers’ pricing expectations in this chapter we explore this dynamic and consider the prospects for the secondary market why secondaries before we consider current market conditions in closer detail let us first remind ourselves of the rationale for investing in secondary funds investors in secondary funds can expect similar benefits to investors in traditional private equity funds including returns that are potentially superior relative to quoted markets in addition secondary funds offer the potential to acquire high quality assets at discounts to net asset value nav benefit from mitigating the ‘jcurve’ due to buying mature portfolios likely to return capital more quickly than a traditional private equity fund and can provide investors with immediate vintage year diversification whilst investing in secondary funds is typically the default option for institutional investors looking to gain exposure to secondary deal flow it is not the only option as we will explore later for some experienced investors investing in secondary transactions rather than specialised secondary funds is potentially a way of achieving many of the above attractive characteristics of secondary investing without the double layer of fees associated with the secondary fund model a recent history in late  amid the market turmoil following the lehman brothers’ bankruptcy estimates of available secondary purchasing capacity were in the region of us billion whilst estimates of the potential supply of opportunities from sellers were in the region of us billion the reported supply of opportunities soared as lps grappled desperately for much needed liquidity and looked to deal with the ‘denominator effect’ whereby the crash in equity markets forced their private equity exposure rapidly above their target allocations in percentage terms this has impacted a large proportion of investors with over  of lps surveyed by probitas partners conceding to being at or above their target allocation to the asset class consequently the widely accepted expectation was that this supplydemand imbalance would allow buyers to dictate prices amid a period of significant deal activity in the secondary market however this expectation has not been borne out in reality actual deal activity between the fourth quarter of  and the present was modest with various secondary intermediaries suggesting transaction volume in  was down  to  compared to  we believe that there have been three main impediments to deal activity buyerseller dislocation pricing expectations between buyers and sellers remain very different so only the deals with the most motivated sellers have completed buyers are cautious given the uncertainty surrounding expected future operational performance of underlying portfolio companies and the validity of gp valuations as such bids made in the first half of  saw  to  discounts to fourth quarter  navs for many buyout funds emphasising that only the most desperate sellers would transact lp liquidity crisis temporarily abated the number of sellers forced to accept any price offered for their positions due to an intense liquidity need has been lower than expected this is thanks to the lack of capital calls from gps reducing the need for available capital and the rebound in equity markets reducing the impact of the ‘denominator effect’ significant divergence between available assets from sellers and buyer preferences much of the estimated supply of opportunities from sellers were  vintage mega buyout funds often largely unfunded positions as lps looked to selectively reduce their unfunded liability in outoffavour strategies in order to allow them to make fresh commitments to  vintage funds however the aforementioned probitas partners’ survey concluded that buyers in the secondary market are most interested in midcap buyout and growth strategies and are particularly averse to mega buyout funds this is either due to concerns about the underlying assets being overvalued and overlevered during the boom period or where the funds remain only partially drawn down meaning there are relatively few assets for secondary buyers to value secondary funds view and outlook the widespread excitement about secondaries appears on the face of it to share some characteristics with recent periods of over exuberance in other areas of the private equity market similar to the mega buyout frenzy in  we are cautious about the widely recognised ‘strategy du jour’ so why should investors be cautious about investing in secondary funds the headline estimated levels of supply of opportunities do not tell the full story as many sellers do not have to sell as such they have held on to their positions hoping to benefit from any upside and they might choose to continue to do so if they do not face significant liquidity problems in addition the headline level of demand is understated due to the emergence of new buyers into the market attracted by potentially outsized returns there is a lot of capital chasing secondary opportunities see figure  showing dedicated secondary funds raised in recent years a report published by cogent partners in  emphasised the emergence of new entrants noting that over  of the bids received in the first half of  were from “nontraditional secondary buyers”  pantheon take note secondaries april   probitas partners second thoughts newsletter volume number  july   cogent partners secondary pricing analysis interim update summer  these buyers include funds of funds sovereign wealth funds and large pension schemes many of whom are natural buyers of the plain vanilla lp stakes available on the secondary market the combination of these factors reduces the perceived supply and demand dislocation between buyers and sellers which secondary managers and intermediaries have been advertising for some time this appears to be having an impact on secondary pricing which increased sharply in the second half of  see figure  ironically some specialist secondary funds invested very little during the pricing trough in late  to early  despite having deployed aggressively in  when prices paid were on average much higher relative to the prevailing nav at the time an additional challenge for potential investors in secondary funds to overcome is the high fees that are charged by secondary managers fees charged in the investment period are typically high at  to  on committed capital however some managers continue to charge on committed capital throughout the life of the vehicle which leads to a substantial fee drag in the latter years of a vehicle’s life figure  emphasises this with the fees charged by secondary managers significantly outweighing the fees charged by the underlying managers in the latter years of a secondary fund’s life given the responsibility lay with the direct manager to actively own the business and manage the exit process this represents an inappropriate drag on fees for the secondary fund investor as with other strategies in private equity and indeed broader illiquid alternatives given the scarcity of capital and challenging fundraising environment we fully expect investors to be able to secure a fairer deal on fees with secondary managers raising funds over the next  to  months so what does the future hold broadly speaking some level of stability in the wider economy and therefore transparency on the operating performance of underlying portfolio companies has proven to be necessary for secondary deal activity to occur sustained economic stability also leads to increased activity in the primary market which has a knockon effect on the secondary market as capital calls crystallise potential liquidity issues for some struggling lps we have seen both increased economic confidence and an uptick in primary and secondary deal activity through late  and early  albeit from a very low base as noted however this secondary deal activity has been clearing at a higher price relative to early  – that is secondary buyers have had to increase their prices for any meaningful deal flow to occur in the secondary market if liquidity concerns do not heighten in the near term buyers including specialist secondary managers who have raised large dedicated vehicles in anticipation of a wave of deal activity that has not yet come to fruition will continue to be forced to increase bids to deploy their capital in order to meet sellers’ expectations as shown in figure  this combined with increasing demand for secondary deals potentially bidding away some of the value on acquisition explains why the market opportunity in secondary investing is not currently compelling in our view we also anticipate an increase in the trend of buyers forcing sellers to slice up their portfolios to allow the acquirers to be selective over which positions they take on during  this was a theme of the market with large auctioned transactions not closing instead buyers took advantage of their improved bargaining position by selecting specific investments within a portfolio that they considered particularly attractive given the increasing number of reasons for secondary sales for example shortterm liquidity relief from future calls risk reduction portfolio management and so on we also predict an increasing volume of structured transactions these could include secondary buyers providing a solution to lps by sharing the burden of capital calls and therefore sharing in the upside of future distributions it could also involve secondary buyers participating in the raising of followon capital for funds for example annex funds or individual portfolio companies for example direct secondaries that are in need of fresh capital often buyers are able to negotiate a ‘preferred equity’ structure in these deals as explained earlier in the chapter an increased interest from nontraditional buyers has been a feature of the secondary market in  and we expect this trend to continue over the medium term despite the caution noted above experienced and longterm investors in the asset class such as some large governancerich pension funds and sovereign wealth funds are well positioned to opportunistically invest in secondary transactions as part of their broader private equity programmes this allows them to enjoy the traditional benefits of secondary investing for example more rapid capital deployment mitigating the ‘jcurve’ and vintage year diversification without the double layer of fees and pressure to deploy a certain level of capital associated with the specialised secondary fund investing model for certain investors given the cyclical nature of secondary investing participating in secondary transactions tactically as and when opportunities present themselves at certain points in the cycle could be an appealing alternative to strategically committing capital to secondary funds on an ongoing basis save save save this log in to access this feature saved added to saved content remove  download pdf contact us related business issues a balanced retirement strategy learn more related
