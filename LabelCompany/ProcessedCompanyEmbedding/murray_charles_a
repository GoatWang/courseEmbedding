pseudoscience and misleading statistics to argue that social inequality is caused by the genetic inferiority of the black and latino communities women and the poor extremist info born  ideology white nationalist about charles murray according to murray disadvantaged groups are disadvantaged because on average they cannot compete with white men who are intellectually psychologically and morally superior murray advocates the total elimination of the welfare state affirmative action and the department of education arguing that public policy cannot overcome the innate deficiencies that cause unequal social and educational outcomes in his own words a huge number of wellmeaning whites fear that they are closet racists and this book tells them they are not its going to make them feel better about things they already think but do not know how to say” —regarding his book losing ground quoted in “daring research or social science pornography charles murray” the new york times magazine  “the professional consensus is that the united states has experienced dysgenic pressures throughout either most of the century the optimists or all of the century the pessimists women of all races and ethnic groups follow this pattern in similar fashion there is some evidence that blacks and latinos are experiencing even more severe dysgenic pressures than whites which could lead to further divergence between whites and other groups in future generations”—the bell curve  “try to imagine a … presidential candidate saying in front of the cameras ‘one reason that we still have poverty in the united states is that a lot of poor people are born lazy’ you cannot imagine it because that kind of thing cannot be said and yet this unimaginable statement merely implies that when we know the complete genetic story it will turn out that the population below the poverty line in the united states has a configuration of the relevant genetic makeup that is significantly different from the configuration of the population above the poverty line this is not unimaginable it is almost certainly true” —“deeper into the brain” national review  “you want to have a job training program for welfare mothers you think that’s going to cure the welfare problem well when you construct that job training program and try to decide what jobs they might qualify for you had better keep in mind that the mean iq of welfare mothers is somewhere in the s which means that you have certain limitations in what youre going to accomplish” —interview on race and iq “think tank with ben wattenberg” pbs  background charles murray has been a central figure in discussions of race intelligence and public policy since the  publication of the bell curve which murray coauthored with controversial psychologist richard herrnstein who died shortly before the book’s publication murray a statistically minded sociologist by training has spent decades working to rehabilitate longdiscredited theories of iq and heredity turning them into a foundation on which to build a conservative theory of society that rejects equality and egalitarianism in murray’s world wealth and social power naturally accrue towards a “cognitive elite” made up of highiq individuals who are overwhelmingly white male and from welltodo families while those on the lower end of the eponymous bell curve form an “underclass” whose misfortunes stem from their low intelligence according to murray the relative differences between the white and black populations of the united states as well as those between men and women have nothing to do with discrimination or historical and structural disadvantages but rather stem from genetic differences between the groups the bell curve which remains murray’s most controversial work firmly lays out murray’s belief shared with herrnstein that the groups that make up the “underclass” are there solely because of their genes many criticisms of the bell curve most notably charles lane’s thorough takedown in the new york review of books have pointed out that murray’s attempts to link social inequality to genes are based on the work of explicitly racist scientists in an afterward to the book murray rejects criticisms that rest on the fact that “we cite thirteen scholars who have received funding from the pioneer fund founded and run lane alleged by men who were nazi sympathizers eugenicists and advocates of white racial superiority” murray contends that the racist pseudoscientists he cites “are some of the most respected psychologists of our time” and that “the relationship between the founder of the pioneer fund and today’s pioneer fund is roughly analogous to that between henry ford and today’s ford foundation” in fact the pioneer fund’s ties to eugenics and white supremacy are not nearly as historically remote as murray would have his readers believe the president of the pioneer fund at the time the bell curve was written was harry weyher who was a personal friend of the fund’s founder wickliffe draper and shared his supposedly archaic views on race just two months after the initial publication of the bell curve weyher gave an interview in which he argued among other things that desegregation had “wrecked the school system” another of the pioneer fund’s board members at the time murray was writing john trevor jr was also an officer of coalition of patriotic societies which during his membership was indicted for sedition over “pronazi activities” and called for the release of all nazi war criminals despite murray’s claims the pioneer fund continues to support “research” into race differences conducted by outright white supremacists in a similar vein murray whitewashes the individual people who provided the intellectual foundation for the bell curve to take only one example murray and herrnstein described richard lynn whose work they relied on more than any other individual as “a leading scholar of racial and ethnic differences” in his many subsequent defenses of lynn murray neglected to mention the many serious methodological criticisms of lynn’s work or his contributions to white supremacist publications including vdarecom american renaissance and mankind quarterly the last of which lynn also serves on the editorial staff of the bell curve not only relied on “tainted sources” like lynn but is itself making a fundamentally eugenic argument the central and most controversial chapter of the book focuses on the threat of “dysgenesis” a term that murray and herrnstein claimed to have borrowed from population biology but which in actuality was coined and has been used exclusively by eugenicists to describe the problem that their policy proposals were intended to fix dysgenesis refers to the supposed genetic deterioration of a population but while murray and herrnstein wrote as though it represents mainstream science dysgenesis is not considered to be a real phenomenon by modern evolutionary biologists it is widely accepted only among the “scholars of racial and ethnic differences” that appear so prominently in the bell curve’s bibliography in the bell curve and in many of his subsequent articles and books murray warns that “dysgenic pressures” will lead eventually to what he calls the “custodial state” if social and economic status is solely a function of iq as murray and herrnstein claim then social stratification will increasingly occur along the lines of innate intelligence this process would turn the united states into “something resembling a caste society with the underclass mired ever more firmly at the bottom and the cognitive elite ever more firmly anchored at the top” the “custodial state” comes about according to murray and herrnstein because the elite feels the need to take responsibility for the “underclass” which especially in the “contemporary inner city” lacks “the minimum level of cognitive resources” necessary to sustain a “modern community” murray claims that the elite has and will continue to address this problem through the welfare state segregation and mass incarceration in the bell curve murray and herrnstein describe the custodial state as a “hightech and more lavish version of the indian reservation for some substantial minority of the nation’s population” and suggest that it should be avoided at all costs as recently as  murray wrote that the custodial state is “not a happy solution” to crime and other social ills evoking racist reaganera attacks on welfare recipients murray and herrnstein contended that government assistance contributes to dysgenic pressures because “for women near the poverty line in most countries in the contemporary west a baby is either free or even profitable depending on the specific terms of the welfare system in her country” according to murray the incentives for poor women to game the welfare system by having babies is particularly strong because thanks to their low iqs “a ‘career’ is not usually seen as a realistic option” welfare in murray and herrnstein’s view only exacerbates the intellectual inferiority and thus the social stratification it is meant to remedy and should be abolished just as dangerous as welfare in murray’s imagination is affirmative action which he and herrnstein credited with “leaking a poison into the american soul” affirmative action according to murray creates racial tension by promoting black people far beyond their innate capabilities in order to produce a false sense of equality to bolster this argument they cite rumors of illiterate or “borderline retarded” black people graduating from police academy and claim that affirmative action forced major cities like washington dc and miami to hire manifestly unqualified black police officers they even blame affirmative action for crimes committed by police highlighting a  incident in which police were found to be helping smugglers conceal hundreds of tons of cocaine similarly they claim that black students are overrepresented in the universities where they get “a large edge in the admissions process and often in scholarship assistance and many of whom as whites look around their own campus and others ‘don’t belong there’ academically” according to murray and herrnstein as white people see less intelligent and competent black people being given preferential treatment “the tension between what the white elite is supposed to think and what it is actually thinking about race will reach something close to a breaking point” and a “new more virulent” racism will emerge prompting renewed attempts to segregate and isolate the black community despite portraying it as the result of liberal policies he opposes however it is clear that the custodial state is precisely the vision of society murray is working to bring about the same  article that deplored “abandoning a central tenet of a free society — that everyone can exercise equal responsibility for his or her own life” — was entitled “the advantages of social apartheid” and its main argument was that as unpleasant as it sounds the custodial state is the best solution to social problems by isolating the “underclass” the children of the cognitive elite for example won’t have to deal with “large numbers of disruptive foulmouthed sexually precocious and sometimes violent classmates” similarly the increasing isolation of the underclass will provide the solution to crime indeed isolation in the form of mass incarceration has according to murray already solved the crime problem in america “we didn’t solve the crime problem by learning how to get tough on the causes of crime nor by rehabilitating criminals we just took them off the streets as of  more than  million americans are incarcerated … it responds to the question ‘does prison work’” again murray pretends to find the prospect of mass imprisonment regrettable and hints that he does not personally believe that the benefits of reduced crime are necessarily worth the cost to the freedom of a large percentage of the population and again he is being dishonest the same year that he wrote “the advantages of social apartheid” he published a short monograph entitled “simple justice” which argued that crime or at least the kinds of crime committed by the “underclass” is not punished harshly enough and that the purpose of the justice system is to exact revenge against criminals without any consideration of extenuating social circumstances at the same time he argued that the justice system unfairly persecutes people who use force to defend their property arguing that a homeowner who chased a wouldbe burglar out into the street and murdered them shouldn’t be seen as having done anything wrong murray’s vision of the future and his efforts to bring it about are even more chilling in the context of his early career murray started out working in thailand for the washington dcbased think tank american institutes for research air while ostensibly conducting basic social science research in remote thai villages murray and his colleagues were working with the us military to develop counterinsurgency programs air’s proposal to the military included plans to develop “stimuli” to bring about desired reactions in the populations examples given included burning the villagers’ crops assassinating political figures “strengthening retaliatory mechanisms and similar preventative measures” and “neutralizing the political successes already achieved by groups committed to the ‘wrong’ side” the last of which “typically involves direct military confrontation” the proposal which is now used as a textbook example of unethical practices in the social sciences also stated that “the potential applicability of the findings in the united states will also receive special attention in many of our key domestic programs especially those directed at disadvantaged subcultures the methodological problems are similar to those described in this proposal and the application of the thai findings at home constitutes a potentially most significant project contribution” as one prominent anthropologist commented “it takes little imagination to recognize the identities of the ‘disadvantaged subcultures’ and the circumstances that would be likely to make them targets of such measures” while most of the criticism directed at murray has with good reason focused on the racist elements of his work his genetic determinism and belief in the inferiority of certain groups extends to the intellectual abilities of women unsurprisingly he holds poor women and women of color in more contempt than he does elite white women however in murray’s mind even elite women are substantially inferior to men in the wake of thenharvard university president larry summers’ censure for his  statements about women’s lack of intellectual aptitude murray built on summers’ claims arguing that “since we live in an age when students are likely to hear more about marie curie than about albert einstein it is worth beginning with a statement of historical fact women have played a proportionally tiny part in the history of the arts and sciences even in the th century women got only  percent of the nobel prizes in the sciences — a proportion constant for both halves of the century — and  percent of the prizes in literature the fields medal the most prestigious award in mathematics has been given to  people since it originated in  all have been men … in the humanities the most abstract

from exeter and andover wrote murray ever since i have seen the sat as the friend of the little guy just as james bryant conant president of harvard said it would be when he urged the sat upon the

murray now considers youthful rebellion im getting married to a onehanded thai buddhist he said this was not the daughterinlaw that would have normally presented itself to an iowa couple murray credits his time in the peace corps in thailand with his lifelong interest in asia there are aspects of asian culture as it is lived that i still prefer to western culture  years after i last lived in thailand says murray two of my children are halfasian apart from those personal aspects i have always thought that the chinese and japanese civilizations had elements that represented the apex of human accomplishment in certain domains his tenure with the peace corps ended in  and during the remainder of his time in thailand he worked for the american institutes for research air which was part of a covert counter insurgency agency run by the us military in cooperation with the cia recalling his time in thailand in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol murray noted that his worldview was fundamentally shaped by his time there essentially most of what you read in my books i learned in thai villages he went on i suddenly was struck first by the enormous discrepancy between what

and pranksterish sensibility as a teen he played pool at a hangout for juvenile delinquents developed debating skills espoused labor unionism to his parents annoyance and on one occasion lit fireworks that were attached to a cross that he put next to a police station murray credits the sat with helping him get out of newton and into harvard back in  the test helped get me into harvard from a small iowa town by giving me a way to show that i could compete with applicants from exeter and andover wrote murray ever since i have seen the sat as the friend of the little guy just as james bryant conant president of harvard said it would be when he urged the sat upon the nation in the s however in an oped published in the new york times on march   murray suggested removing the sats role in college admissions noting that the sat has become a symbol of newupperclass privilege as people assume albeit wrongly that high scores are purchased through the resources of private schools and expensive test preparation programs murray obtained a ba in history from harvard in  and a phd in political science from the massachusetts institute of technology in  peace corpsedit murray left for

mail from thailand and their marriage began the following year a move that murray now considers youthful rebellion im getting married to a onehanded thai buddhist he said this was not the daughterinlaw that would have normally presented itself to an iowa couple murray credits his time in the peace corps in thailand with his lifelong interest in asia there are aspects of asian culture as it is lived that i still prefer to western culture  years after i last lived in thailand says murray two of my children are halfasian apart from those personal aspects i have always thought that the chinese and japanese civilizations had elements that represented the apex of human accomplishment in certain domains his tenure with the peace corps ended in  and during the remainder of his time in thailand he worked for the american institutes for research air which was part of a covert counter insurgency agency run by the us military in cooperation with the cia recalling his time in thailand in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol murray noted that his worldview was fundamentally shaped by his time there essentially most of what you read in my books i learned in thai villages he went on i suddenly was struck first by the enormous discrepancy between what bangkok thought was important to the villagers and what the villagers wanted out of government and the second thing i got out of it was that when the government change agent showed up the village went to hell in terms of its internal governance murrays work in the peace corps and subsequent social research in

political scientist author and columnist his book losing ground american social policy –  which discussed the american welfare system was widely read and discussed and influenced subsequent government

education level of many individual outcomes including income job performance pregnancy out of wedlock and crime and social welfare programs and education efforts to improve social outcomes for the disadvantaged are largely wasted murrays most successful subsequent books have been human accomplishment the pursuit of excellence in the arts and sciences  bc to   and coming apart the state of white

republican norman rockwell kind of family that stressed moral responsibility he is the son of frances b née patrick and alan b murray a maytag company executive his youth was marked by a rebellious and pranksterish sensibility as a teen he played pool at a hangout for juvenile delinquents developed debating skills espoused labor unionism to his parents annoyance and on one occasion lit fireworks that were attached to a cross that he put next to a police station murray credits the sat with helping him get out of newton and into harvard back in  the test helped get me into harvard from a small iowa town by giving me a way to show that i could compete with applicants from exeter and andover wrote murray ever since i have seen the sat as the friend of the little guy just as james bryant conant president of harvard said it would be when he urged the sat upon the nation in the s however in an oped published in the new york times on march   murray suggested removing the sats role in college admissions noting that the sat has become a symbol of newupperclass privilege as people assume albeit wrongly that high scores are purchased through the resources of private schools and expensive test preparation programs murray obtained a ba in history from harvard in  and a phd in political science from the massachusetts institute of technology in  peace corpsedit murray left for the peace corps in thailand in  staying abroad for a formative six years at the beginning of this period the young murray kindled a romance with his thai buddhist language instructor in hawaii suchart dejudom the daughter of a wealthy thai businessman who was born with one hand and a mind sharp enough to outscore the rest of the country on the college entrance exam murray subsequently proposed by mail from thailand and their marriage began the following year a move that murray now considers youthful rebellion im getting married to a onehanded thai buddhist he said this was not the daughterinlaw that would have normally presented itself to an iowa couple murray credits his time in the peace corps in thailand with his lifelong interest in asia there are aspects of asian culture as it is lived that i still prefer to western culture  years after i last lived in thailand says murray two of my children are halfasian apart from those personal aspects i have always thought that the chinese and japanese civilizations had elements that represented the apex of human accomplishment in certain domains his tenure with the peace corps ended in  and during the remainder of his time in thailand he worked for the american institutes for research air which was part of a covert counter insurgency agency run by the us military in cooperation with the cia recalling his time in thailand in a  episode of conversations with bill kristol murray noted that his worldview was fundamentally shaped by his time there essentially most of what you read in my books i learned in thai villages he went on i suddenly was struck first by the enormous discrepancy between what bangkok thought was important to the villagers and what the villagers wanted out of government and the second thing i got out of it was that when the government change agent showed up the village went to hell in terms of its internal governance murrays work in the peace corps and subsequent social research in thailand for research firms associated with the us government led to the subject of his statistical doctoral thesis in political science at mit in which he argued against bureaucratic intervention in the lives of the thai villagers divorce and remarriageedit by the s his marriage to suchart dejudom had been unhappy for years but his childhood lessons on the importance of responsibility brought him slowly to the idea that divorce was an honorable alternative especially with young children involved murray divorced dejudom after fourteen years of marriage and three years later married catherine bly cox born  newton iowa an english literature instructor at rutgers university cox was initially dubious when she saw his conservative reading choices and she spent long hours trying to reconcile his shocking views with what she saw as his deep decency in  murray and cox coauthored a book on the apollo program apollo race to the moon murray attends and cox is a member of a quaker meeting in virginia and they live in frederick county maryland near washington dc murray has four children two by each wife and remains close with both families his second wife catherine bly cox had converted to quakerism as of update while murray considered himself an agnostic research and viewsedit murray began research work at the american institutes for research air one of the largest of the private social science research organizations upon his return to the us from  to  murray worked for the air eventually becoming chief political scientist while at air murray supervised evaluations in the fields of urban education welfare services daycare adolescent pregnancy services for the elderly and criminal justice from  to  he was a fellow with the conservative manhattan institute where he wrote losing ground which heavily influenced the welfare reform debate in  and in pursuit he has been a fellow of the american enterprise institute since  and was a frequent contributor to the public interest a journal of conservative politics and culture in march  he received aeis highest honor the irving kristol award he has also received a doctorate honoris causa from universidad francisco marroquín murray has received grants from the conservative bradley foundation to support his scholarship including the writing of the bell curve murrays lawedit murrays law is a set of conclusions derived by charles murray in his book losing ground american social policy – essentially it states that all social welfare programs are doomed to effect a net harm on society and actually hurt the very people those programs are trying to help in the end he concludes that all social welfare programs cannot be successful and should ultimately be eliminated altogether murrays law the law of imperfect selection any objective rule that defines eligibility for a social transfer program will irrationally exclude some persons the law of unintended rewards any social transfer increases the net value of being in the condition that prompted the transfer the law of net harm the less likely it is that the unwanted behavior will change voluntarily the more likely it is that a program to induce change will cause net harm the bell curveedit external video booknotes interview with murray on the bell curve december   cspan the bell curve intelligence and class structure in american life  is a controversial bestseller that charles murray wrote with the harvard professor richard j herrnstein its central thesis is that intelligence is a better predictor of many factors including financial income job performance unwed pregnancy and crime than ones parents socioeconomic status or education level also the book argued that those with high intelligence the cognitive elite are becoming separated from the general population of those with average and belowaverage intelligence and that this was a dangerous social trend murray expanded on this theme in his  book coming apart of the books origins murray has said i got interested in iq and its relationship to social problems and by  i had decided i was going to write a book about it but then dick herrnstein a professor at harvard who had written on iq in the past had an article in the atlantic monthly which led me to think ah herrnstein is already doing this so i called him up i had met him before wed been friendly and i said if you’re doing a book on this im not going to try to compete with you and dick said to me no im not and he paused and he said why dont we do it together much of the controversy stemmed from chapters  and  where the authors write about the enduring differences in race and intelligence and discuss implications of that difference they write in the introduction to chapter  that the debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved and it seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences the books title comes from the bellshaped normal distribution of iq scores the normal distribution is the limiting distribution of a random quantity which is the sum of smaller independent random phenomena after its publication various commentators criticized and defended the book some critics said it supported scientific racism and a number of books were written to rebut the bell curve those works included a  edition of evolutionary biologist stephen jay goulds the mismeasure of man a collection of essays the bell curve wars  reacting to murray and herrnsteins commentary and the bell curve debate  whose essays similarly respond to issues raised in the bell curve arthur s goldberger and charles f manski critique the empirical methods supporting the books hypotheses citing assertions made by murray in the bell curve the southern poverty law center labeled him a white nationalist charging his ideas were rooted in eugenics murray eventually responded in a pointbypoint rebuttal to those accusations labeling them as misquotations misrepresentations and outright factual errors in  murray authored a policy study for aei on the same subject matter as the bell curve in which he wrote try to imagine a gop presidential candidate saying in front of the cameras one reason that we still have poverty in the united states is that a lot of poor people are born lazy you cannot imagine it because that kind of thing cannot be said and yet this unimaginable statement merely implies that when we know the complete genetic story it will turn out that the population below the poverty line in the united states has a configuration of the relevant genetic makeup that is significantly different from the configuration of the population above the poverty line this is not unimaginable it is almost certainly true educationedit murray has been critical of the no child left behind law arguing that it set a goal that was devoid of any contact with reality the united states congress acting with large bipartisan majorities at the urging of the president enacted as the law of the land that all children are to be above average he sees the law as an example of educational romanticism which asks too much from students at the bottom of the intellectual pile asks the wrong things from those in the middle and asks too little from those at the top challenging educational romanticism he wrote real education four simple truths for bringing americas schools back to reality his four simple truths are as follows ability varies half of all children are below average too many people are going to college americas future depends on how we educate the academically gifted human group differencesedit murray has attracted controversy for his views on differences between gender and racial groups in a paper published in  titled where are the female einsteins murray stated among other things that no woman has been a significant original thinker in any of the worlds great philosophical traditions in the sciences the most abstract field is mathematics where the number of great female mathematicians is approximately two emmy noether definitely sonya kovalevskaya maybe in the other hard sciences the contributions of great women have usually been empirical rather than theoretical with leading cases in point being henrietta leavitt dorothy hodgkin lise meitner irene joliotcurie and marie curie herself asked about this in  he stated he could only recall one important female philosopher and she was not a significant thinker in the estimation of historians of philosophy adding so yeah i still stick with that until somebody gives me evidence to the contrary i’ll stick with that statement in  murray wrote a back cover blurb for james r flynns book what is intelligence this book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work much of which was new to me all of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that flynn discusses are in his debt in  a speech that murray was scheduled to give at azusa pacific university was postponed due to murrays research on human group differences murray responded to the institution by pointing out that it was a disservice to the students and faculty to dismiss research because of its controversial nature rather than the evidence murray also urged the university to consider his works as they are and reach conclusions for themselves rather than relying on sources that specialize in libeling people oped writingsedit murray has published opinion pieces in the new republic commentary the public interest the new york times the wall street journal national review and the washington post he has been a witness before united states house and senate committees and a consultant to senior republican government officials in the united states and other conservative officials in the united kingdom eastern europe and the organization for economic cooperation and developmentcitation needed in the april  issue of commentary magazine murray wrote on the disproportionate representation of jews in the ranks of outstanding achievers and says that one of the reasons is that they have been found to have an unusually high mean intelligence as measured by iq tests since the first jewish samples were tested his article concludes with the assertion at this point i take sanctuary in my remaining hypothesis uniquely parsimonious and happily irrefutable the jews are gods chosen people in the julyaugust  issue of the american a magazine published by the american enterprise institute murray says he has changed his mind about sat tests and says they should be scrapped perhaps the sat had made an important independent contribution to predicting college performance in earlier years but by the time research was conducted in the last half of the s the test had already been ruined by political correctness murray advocates replacing the traditional sat with the college boards subject achievement tests the surprising empirical reality is that the sat is redundant if students are required to take achievement tests in one column murray voiced his support for gay marriage incident at middlebury collegeedit on march   murray was shouted down at middlebury college middlebury vermont by students and others not connected with the school and prevented from speaking at the original location on campus the speech was moved to another location and a closed circuit broadcast showed him being interviewed by professor allison stanger after the interview college administrators claim there was a violent confrontation by protesters against murray vice president for communications bill burger and stanger who was injured with a neck injury and concussion as they left the mccullough student center middlebury students claimed that middlebury public safety officers instigated and escalated violence against nonviolent protesters and that administrator bill burger assaulted protesters with a car middlebury president laurie l patton responded after the event saying the school would respond to the clear violations of middlebury college

controversial bestseller that charles murray wrote with the harvard professor richard j herrnstein its central thesis is that intelligence is a better predictor of many factors including financial income job performance unwed pregnancy and crime than ones parents socioeconomic status or education level also the book argued that those with high intelligence the cognitive elite are becoming separated from the general population of those with average and belowaverage intelligence and that this was a dangerous social trend murray expanded on this theme in his  book coming apart of the books origins murray has said i got interested in iq and its relationship to social problems and by  i had decided i was going to write a book about it but then dick herrnstein a professor at harvard who had written on iq in the past had an article in the atlantic monthly which led me to think ah herrnstein is already doing this so i called him up i had met him before wed been friendly and i said if you’re doing a book on this im not going to try to compete with you and dick said to me no im not and he paused and he said why dont we do it together much of the controversy stemmed from chapters  and  where the authors write about the enduring differences in race and intelligence and discuss implications of that difference they write in the introduction to chapter  that the debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved and it seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences the books title comes from the bellshaped normal distribution of iq scores the normal distribution is the limiting distribution of a random quantity which is the sum of smaller independent random phenomena after its publication various commentators criticized and defended the book some critics said it supported scientific racism and a number of books were written to rebut the bell curve those works included a  edition of evolutionary biologist stephen jay goulds the mismeasure of man a collection of essays the bell curve wars  reacting to murray and herrnsteins commentary and the bell curve debate  whose essays similarly respond to issues raised in the bell curve arthur s goldberger and charles f manski critique the empirical methods supporting the books hypotheses citing assertions made by murray in the bell curve the southern poverty law center labeled him a white nationalist charging his ideas were rooted in eugenics murray eventually responded in a pointbypoint rebuttal to those accusations labeling them as misquotations misrepresentations and outright factual errors in  murray authored a policy study for aei on the same subject matter as the bell curve in which he wrote try to imagine a gop presidential candidate saying in front of the cameras one reason that we still have poverty in the united states is that a lot of poor people are born lazy you cannot imagine it because that kind of thing cannot be said and yet this unimaginable statement merely implies that when we know the complete genetic story it will turn out that the population below the poverty line in the united states has a configuration of the relevant genetic makeup that is significantly different from the configuration of the population above the poverty line this is not unimaginable it is almost certainly true educationedit murray has been critical of the no child left behind law arguing that it set a goal that was devoid of any contact with reality the united states congress acting with large bipartisan majorities at the urging of the president enacted as the law of the land that all children are to be above average he sees the law as an example of educational romanticism which asks too much from students at the bottom of the intellectual pile asks the wrong things from those in the middle and asks too little from those at the top challenging educational romanticism he wrote real education four simple truths for bringing americas schools back to reality his four simple truths are as follows ability varies half of all children are below average too many people are going to college americas future depends on how we educate the academically gifted human group differencesedit murray has attracted controversy for his views on differences between gender and racial groups in a paper published in  titled where are the female einsteins murray stated among other things that no woman has been a significant original thinker in any of the worlds great philosophical traditions in the sciences the most abstract field is mathematics where the number of great female mathematicians is approximately two emmy noether definitely sonya kovalevskaya maybe in the other hard sciences the contributions of great women have usually been empirical rather than theoretical with leading cases in point being henrietta leavitt dorothy hodgkin lise meitner irene joliotcurie and marie curie herself asked about this in  he stated he could only recall one important female philosopher and she was not a significant thinker in the estimation of historians of philosophy adding so yeah i still stick with that until somebody gives me evidence to the contrary i’ll stick with that statement in  murray wrote a back cover blurb for james r flynns book what is intelligence this book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work much of which was new to me all of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that flynn discusses are in his debt in  a speech that murray was scheduled to give at azusa pacific university was postponed due to murrays research on human group differences murray responded to the institution by pointing out that it was a disservice to the students and faculty to dismiss research because of its controversial nature rather than the evidence murray also urged the university to consider his works as they are and reach conclusions for themselves rather than relying on sources that specialize in libeling people oped writingsedit murray has published opinion pieces in the new republic commentary the public interest the new york times the wall street journal national review and the washington post he has been a witness before united states house and senate committees and a consultant to senior republican government officials in the united states and other conservative officials in the united kingdom eastern europe and the organization for economic cooperation and developmentcitation needed in the april  issue of commentary magazine murray wrote on the disproportionate representation of jews in the ranks of outstanding achievers and says that one of the reasons is that they have been found to have an unusually high mean intelligence as measured by iq tests since the first jewish samples were tested his article concludes with the assertion at this point i take sanctuary in my remaining hypothesis uniquely parsimonious and happily irrefutable the jews are gods chosen people in the julyaugust  issue of the american a magazine published by the american enterprise institute murray says he has changed his mind about sat tests and says they should be scrapped perhaps the sat had made an important independent contribution to predicting college performance in earlier years but by the time research was conducted in the last half of the s the test had already been ruined by political correctness murray advocates replacing the traditional sat with the college boards subject achievement tests the surprising empirical reality is that the sat is redundant if students are required to take achievement tests in one column murray voiced his support for gay marriage incident at middlebury collegeedit on march   murray was shouted down at middlebury college middlebury vermont by students and others not connected with the school and prevented from speaking at the original location on campus the speech was moved to another location and a closed circuit broadcast showed him being interviewed by professor allison stanger after the interview college administrators claim there was a violent confrontation by protesters against murray vice president for communications bill burger and stanger who was injured with a neck injury and concussion as they left the mccullough student center middlebury students claimed that middlebury public safety officers instigated and escalated violence against nonviolent protesters and that administrator bill burger assaulted protesters with a car middlebury president laurie l patton responded after the event saying the school would respond to the clear violations of middlebury college policy that occurred inside and outside wilson hall a number of students and faculty later expressed their personal feelings about his visit the school took disciplinary action against  students for

which he wrote try to imagine a gop presidential candidate saying in front of the cameras one reason that we still have poverty in the united states is that a lot of poor people are born lazy you cannot imagine it because that kind of thing cannot be said and yet this unimaginable statement merely implies that when we know the complete genetic story it will turn out that the population below the poverty line in the united states has a configuration of the relevant genetic makeup that is significantly different from the configuration of the population above the poverty line this is not unimaginable it is almost certainly true educationedit murray has been critical of the no child left behind law arguing that it set a goal that was devoid of any contact with reality the united states congress acting with large bipartisan majorities at the urging of the president enacted as the law of the land that all children are to be above average he sees the law as an example of educational romanticism which asks too much from students at the bottom of the intellectual pile asks the wrong things from those in the middle and asks too little from those at the top challenging educational romanticism he wrote real education four simple truths for bringing americas schools back to reality his four simple truths are as follows ability varies half of all children are below average too many people are going to college americas future depends on how we educate the academically gifted human group differencesedit murray has attracted controversy for his views on differences between gender and racial groups in a paper published in  titled where are the female einsteins murray stated among other things that no woman has been a significant original thinker in any of the worlds great philosophical traditions in the sciences the most abstract field is mathematics where the number of great female mathematicians is approximately two emmy noether definitely sonya kovalevskaya maybe in the other hard sciences the contributions of great women have usually been empirical rather than theoretical with leading cases in point being henrietta leavitt dorothy hodgkin lise meitner irene joliotcurie and marie curie herself asked about this in  he stated he could only recall one important female philosopher and she was not a significant thinker in the estimation of historians of philosophy adding so yeah i still stick with that until somebody gives me evidence to the contrary i’ll stick with that statement in  murray wrote a back cover blurb for james r flynns book what is intelligence this book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work much of which was new to me all of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that flynn discusses are in his debt in  a speech that murray was scheduled to give at azusa pacific university was postponed due to murrays research on human group differences murray responded to the institution by pointing out that it was a disservice to the students and faculty to dismiss research because of its controversial nature rather than the evidence murray also urged the university to consider his works as they are and reach conclusions for themselves rather than relying on sources that specialize in libeling people oped writingsedit murray has published opinion pieces in the new republic commentary the public interest the new york times the wall street journal national review and the washington post he has been a witness before united states house and senate committees and a consultant to senior republican government officials in the united states and other conservative officials in the united kingdom eastern europe and the organization for economic cooperation and developmentcitation needed in the april  issue of commentary magazine murray wrote on the disproportionate representation of jews in the ranks of outstanding achievers and says that one of the reasons is that they have been found to have an unusually high mean intelligence as measured by iq tests since the first jewish samples were tested his article concludes with the assertion at this point i take sanctuary in my remaining hypothesis uniquely parsimonious and happily irrefutable the jews are gods chosen people in the julyaugust  issue of the american a magazine published by the american enterprise institute murray says he has changed his mind about sat tests and says they should be scrapped perhaps the sat had made an important independent contribution to predicting college performance in earlier years but by the time research was conducted in the last half of the s the test had already been ruined by political correctness murray advocates replacing the traditional sat with the college boards subject achievement tests the surprising empirical reality is that the sat is redundant if students are required to take achievement tests in one column murray voiced his support for gay marriage incident at middlebury collegeedit on march   murray was shouted down at middlebury college middlebury vermont by students and others not connected with the school and prevented from speaking at the original location on campus the speech was moved to another location and a closed circuit broadcast showed him being interviewed by professor allison stanger after the interview college administrators claim there was a violent confrontation by protesters against murray vice president for communications bill burger and stanger who was injured with a neck injury and concussion as they left the mccullough student center middlebury students claimed that middlebury public safety officers instigated and escalated violence against nonviolent protesters and that administrator bill burger assaulted protesters with a car middlebury president laurie l patton responded after the event saying the school would respond to the clear violations of middlebury college policy that occurred inside and outside wilson hall a number of students and faculty later expressed their personal feelings about his visit the school took disciplinary action against  students for

upper class—i work for the american enterprise institute which is deeply involved with the major players in national public policy in my personal life my family has lived in a rural mostly bluecollar world and our local concerns have been the same as those of our neighbors i’ve been observing trends in both of those worlds at first hand and the growing cultural separation of the two has been obvious coming apart also represents the culmination of work on the relationship of human happiness to public policy that began with a book called in pursuit that i wrote in the mid s this is my final and in my opinion best statement of some issues that have been extremely important to me for a long time   q you focus solely on white america in your analysis why is that a to get rid of distractions if i had included everybody in the analysis then readers could reasonably wonder how much of the problems i’m talking about are really grounded in america’s racial and ethnic history by limiting the analysis to whites those explanations are out the window   q  hasn’t there always been an upper and lower class what makes the current classes so different a white americans across classes—actually americans of all races but it’s simpler to make the case for whites—used to share a common culture when it came the basics behaviors associated with marriage and family work religiosity and lawabidingness were all extremely similar across classes in the last fifty years that’s changed on all of those dimensions large gaps have opened up between the white upper middle class and the white working class the white upper middle class still behaves much as it did in  the white working class has deteriorated substantially on all four of those dimensions another thing has happened as well a new upper class has developed a distinctive culture—in their delayed marriage and childbearing childraising practices work environments the things they eat and drink their comparatively sparse exposure to mainstream film and television products and their increasing geographic isolation in communities filled with people just like themselves   q  you talk about both the “upper middle class” and the “upper class” what’s the difference is the middle class disappearing a i use the term “upper middle class” to refer to people with at least a college degree and who work in a managerial position or one of the highprestige professions or someone who is married to such a person this group constitutes about  percent of the white adult population the “upper class” is a small subset of that group who are the most successful construed broadly the upper class includes those who are influential within a city or region—for example the owners of the most important local businesses the people who run the local television stations and newspapers the most successful lawyers and physicians construed narrowly the upper class consists of those who have risen to jobs that directly affect the nation’s culture economy and politics—the lawyers and judges who shape constitutional jurisprudence the people who decide how the news will be covered on national news programs the top executives in the nation’s largest private and public institutions the people who create the nation’s films and television drama the most influential scholars in the nation’s elite universities and research institutes and senior government administrators and politicians put roughly you can think of the upper class as the most successful five percent of the upper middle class i don’t see evidence for a shrinking middle class it’s the working class that has shrunk in  about  percent of the white population was in the upper middle class as i defined it and another  percent were in the working class defined as people with no more than a high school education working in a blue collar job lowskill service job or lowskill white collar job that left  percent in between filling the jobs identified with the middle class—skilled white collar jobs nurses k teachers storeowners insurance agents and the like by   percent of whites were in the upper middle class and  percent were in the working class by these definitions leaving  percent above the working class and below the upper middle class compared to just  percent in  that doesn’t look like a shrinking middle class to me   q is the social breakdown you discuss in coming apart related to the current occupy wall street protests and cries of the “” a yes in a way both the ows movement and the tea party share a visceral anger at an elite that they think is bringing down the country in effect coming apart says there is some reason for that anger but it’s not a simple matter of selfish billionaires as the ows seems to think or of liberal politicians imposing their own ideas on everyone else as the tea party sees it there’s an element of truth to those charges but the larger issue is one of cultural inequality not income inequality and an isolation of the elite that is not anyone’s “fault” but is an inevitable side effect of some complicated forces coming apart tries to lay out that more nuanced picture   q what can be done to bridge the gap between the classes the first step is for the upper middle class to start preaching what it practices when it comes to creating families and a great environment for raising children working hard and obeying the law the upper middle class is doing just fine about as well as it always has if not quite but what the upper middle class won’t do is say openly that things like marriage hard work and honesty are the path to human flourishing for everyone not just themselves but our upper middle class and especially the elites within the upper middle class are in the grips of nonjudgmentalism they’re afraid to say that what’s been so good in their own lives arises from cultural norms that are good for everyone the second step is for the upper class in particular to start thinking about where they want to live and raise their children do they really need to choose the neighborhood with the very richest and most highly educated population wouldn’t there be some benefits to living in a nice house in a nice neighborhood where everybody else wasn’t just like them   q is the dream of american social mobility dead a not even close on the contrary a talented young person from a disadvantaged background has never had a more open road to success the problem is not that talent is being blocked but that in a perfectly meritocratic society the churning in social mobility subsides after a few generations because the most talented tend to marry each other and their children dominate the ranks of the most talented in the next generation america’s meritocracy has not been perfect but it has been good enough over the last fifty years that we are seeing less churning than we used to   q you describe the “new elite” as being founded in large part on college education many predict that college will be the next “bubble” to burst due to rising tuition outofcontrol student loans and dwindling job prospects for graduates if that happens and fewer americans end up going to college how would that affect american society and the market for brains that you describe in the book a actually the new elite is founded on brains the reason that harvard and yale grads do so well has little to do with what harvard and yale teaches them the key thing about harvard and yale grads is that they were admitted four years earlier which accurately tells prospective employers that these grads are almost certainly very very smart and that they also showed evidence of other kinds of accomplishment by the time they were  i agree that college education these days has all the characteristics of a bubble i’ll go further and argue the ba has become a scam but falling college enrollment wouldn’t have any effect on the upper middle class their children will still go to college it wouldn’t have any effect on the most talented the elite schools will still seek them out no matter what their background may be and falling college enrollment would be completely irrelevant to underlying dynamic in today’s economy brains are worth a lot more money than they used to be    table of contents prologue november   part ithe formation of a new upper class our kind of people  the
