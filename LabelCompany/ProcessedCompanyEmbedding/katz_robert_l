katz  kahn in spring  as a required reading for organization theories core course at new york university wagner graduate school of public administration based upon my readings and use of this text book for both academic and later business research i strongly believe that this structurally detailed powerful and insightful book is a required core basic studies reading for high school college

organizations within both public and private economy sector organizationsthe formal goals of the formal organization are not necessarily those of the informal organization and vice a versathis landmark research work by katz  kahan greatly enhances sensitizes and helps the reader to conceptually organize catalogue organizations and individuals by both types of organizational hierarchy and types of individuals characterietics so that we may more easily deal with both formal and informal organizations and individuals in a smoother more rational less emotional manneri teach an executive project managment course in both the public and private sectors of the economy when teaching project management to the us department of defense the us navy navsea i have always recommended the supplemental research use of the social psychology of organizations by daniel kats robert louis kahn as i do when teaching and consulting within the private sector of the economykatz  kahans the social psychology of organizations provides the reader with a rich detailed structured frameworkindeed a structured compartmentalized baseline against which we can compare multiple types of diversified organizations and multiple types of diversified individuals as we meet them throughout the lifetime course our public and private livessince a corporation is indeed a formal organization and the corporation is a living entity then this work allows the reader to understand the diversified sometimes disfunctional personalities of the formal organization vs the informal organization corporate culture as they relate to us as the individual having to work and live wihtin their corporate contexts paramaters and according to their unique set of corporate cultural rules and their respective formal and informal regulationsfrom a psychological perspective the social psychology of organizations by katz  kahan both forewarns and forearms individuals vis a vis their interactions
