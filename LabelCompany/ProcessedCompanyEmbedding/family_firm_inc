weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis

related terms family limited partnerships closely held corporations succession plans a familyowned business may be defined as any business in which two or more family members are involved and the majority of ownership or control lies within a family familyowned businesses may be the oldest form of business organization farms were an early form of family business in which what we think of today as the private life and work life were intertwined in urban settings it was once normal for a shopkeeper or doctor to live in the same building in which he or she worked and family members often helped with the business as needed since the early s the academic study of family business as a distinct and important category of commerce has developed today family owned businesses are recognized as important and dynamic participants in the world economy according to the us bureau of the census about  percent of american businesses are familyowned or controlled ranging in size from twoperson partnerships to fortune  firms these businesses account for half of the nations employment and half of her gross national product family businesses may have some advantages over other business entities in their focus on the long term their commitment to quality which is often associated with the family name and their care and concern for employees but family businesses also face a unique set of management challenges stemming from the overlap of family and business issues issues in family businesses a family business can be described as an interaction between two separate but connected systems—the business and the family—with uncertain boundaries and different rules graphically this concept can be presented as two intersecting circles family businesses may include numerous combinations of family members in various business roles including husbands and wives parents and children extended families and multiple generations playing the roles of stockholders board members working partners advisors and employees conflicts often arise due to the overlap of these roles the ways in which individuals typically communicate within a family for example may be inappropriate in business situations likewise personal concerns or rivalries may carry over into the work place to the detriment of the firm in order to succeed a family business must keep lines of communication open make use of strategic planning tools and engage the assistance of outside advisors as needed family versus nonfamily employees there are a number of common issues that most family businesses face at one time or another attracting and retaining nonfamily employees can be problematic because such employees may find it difficult to deal with family conflicts on the job limited opportunities for advancement and the special treatment sometimes accorded family members in addition some family members may resent outsiders being brought into the firm and purposely make things unpleasant for nonfamily employees but outsiders can provide a stabilizing force in a family business by offering a fair and impartial perspective on business issues family business leaders can conduct exit interviews with departing nonfamily employees to determine the cause of turnover and develop a course of action to prevent it employment qualifications many family businesses also have trouble determining guidelines and qualifications for family members hoping to participate in the business some companies try to limit the participation of people with certain relationships to the family such as inlaws in order to minimize the potential for conflicts family businesses often face pressure to hire relatives or close friends who may lack the talent or skill to make a useful contribution to the business once hired such people can be difficult to fire even if they cost the company money or reduce the motivation of other employees by exhibiting a poor attitude a strict policy of only hiring people with legitimate qualifications to fill existing openings can help a company avoid such problems but only if the policy is applied without exception if a company is forced to hire a lessthandesirable employee analysts suggest providing special training to develop a useful talent enlisting the help of a nonfamily employee in training and supervising and assigning special projects that minimize negative contact with other employees salaries and compensation another challenge frequently encountered by family businesses involves paying salaries to and dividing the profits among the family members who participate in the firm in order to grow a small business must be able to use a relatively large percentage of profits for expansion but some family members especially those who are owners but not employees of the company may not see the value of expenditures that reduce the amount of current dividends they receive this is a source of conflict for many family firms and an added level of difficulty in making the necessary investments into the business for continued success to ensure that salaries are distributed fairly among family and nonfamily employees business leaders should match them to industry guidelines for each job description when additional compensation is needed to reward certain employees for their contributions to the company fringe benefits or equity distributions can be used succession another important issue relating to family businesses is succession—determining who will take over leadership andor ownership of the company when the current generation retires or dies the key to avoiding conflicts about who will take over a business is having a welldefined plan in place a family retreat or a meeting on neutral ground without distractions or interruptions can be an ideal setting to open discussions on family goals and future plans the timing of expected transitions and the preparation of the current generation for stepping down and the future generation for taking over when succession is postponed older relatives who remain involved in the family firm may develop a preference for maintaining the status quo these people may resist change and refuse to take risks even though such an attitude can inhibit business growth the business leaders should take steps to gradually remove these relatives from the daily operations of the firm including encouraging them to become involved in outside activities arranging for them to sell some of their stock or convert it to preferred shares or possibly restructuring the company to dilute their influence family business leaders can take a number of steps in order to avoid becoming caught up in these common pitfalls having a clear statement of goals an organized plan to accomplish the goals a defined hierarchy for decisionmaking an established plan for succession and strong lines of communication will help to prevent many possible problems from arising all family members involved in the business must understand that their rights and responsibilities are different at home and at work while family relationships and goals take precedence at home the success of the business comes first at work when emotion intrudes upon work relationships something that happens in all businesses from time to time and the inevitable conflicts between family members arise the manager must intervene and make the objective decisions necessary to protect the interests of the firm rather than taking sides in a dispute the manager must make it clear to all employees that personal disagreements will not be allowed to interfere with work this approach should discourage employees from jockeying for position or playing politics the business leader may also find it useful to have regular meetings with family members and to put all business agreements and policy guidelines in writing the planning process strategic planning—centering around both business and family goals—is vital to successful family businesses in fact planning may be more crucial to family businesses than to other types of business entities because in many cases families have a majority of their assets tied up in the business since much conflict arises due to a disparity between family and business goals planning is required to align these goals and formulate a strategy for reaching them the ideal plan will allow the company to balance family and business needs to everyones advantage family planning in family planning all interested members of the family get together to develop a mission statement that describes why they are committed to the business in allowing family members to share their goals needs priorities strengths weaknesses and ability to contribute family planning helps create a unified vision of the company that will guide future dealings a special meeting called a family retreat or family council can guide the communication process and encourage involvement by providing family members with a venue to voice their opinions and plan for the future in a structured way by participating in the family retreat children can gain a better understanding of the opportunities in the business learn about managing resources and inherit values and traditions it also provides an opportunity for conflicts to be discussed and settled topics brought to family councils can include rules for joining the business treatment of family members working and not working in the business role of inlaws evaluations and pay scales stock ownership ways to provide financial security for the senior generation training and development of the junior generation the companys image in the community philanthropy opportunities for new businesses and diverse interests among family members leadership of the family council can be on a rotating basis or an outside family business consultant may be hired as a facilitator business planning business planning begins with the longterm goals and objectives the family holds for themselves and for the business the business leaders then integrate these goals into the business strategy in business planning management analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the company in relation to its environment including its organizational structure culture and resources the next stage involves identifying opportunities for the company to pursue given its strengths and threats for the company to manage given its weaknesses finally the planning process concludes with the creation of a mission statement a set of objectives and a set of general strategies and specific action steps to meet the objectives and support the mission this process is often overseen by a board of directors an advisory board or professional advisors succession planning succession planning involves deciding who will lead the company in the next generation unfortunately less than onethird of familyowned businesses survive the transition from the first generation of ownership to the second and only  percent of family businesses remain in the family over  years problems making the transition can occur for any number of reasons  the business was no longer viable  the next generation did not wish to continue the business or  the new leadership was not prepared for the burden of full operational control lack of planning however is by far the most common underlying reason for a company to fail in the generational transition at any given time a full  percent of american firms are facing the succession issue yet relatively few make succession plans business owners may be reluctant to face the issue because they do not want to relinquish control feel their successor is not ready have few interests outside the business or wish to maintain the sense of identity they have for so long gotten from their work but it is vital that the succession process be carefully planned before it becomes necessary due to the owners illness or death family businesses are advised to follow a fivestage process in planning for succession initiation selection education finance preparation and transition in the initiation phase possible successors are introduced to the business and guided through a variety of work experiences of increasing responsibility in the selection phase a successor is chosen and a schedule is developed for the transition analysts almost unanimously recommend that the successor be a single individual and not a group of siblings or cousins to some degree by selecting a group the existing leadership is merely postponing the decision or leaving it to the next generation to sort out during the education phase the business owner gradually hands over the reigns to the successor one task at a time so that he or she may learn the requirements of the position finance preparation involves making arrangements so that the departing management team can withdraw funds enough to retire the more time is used in preparing for the financial implications of this transition the more likely a business will be able to avoid being burdened in the process in the transition phase the business changes hands—the business owner removes himself or herself from the daily operations of the firm this final stage can be the most difficult as many entrepreneurs experience great difficulty in letting go of the family business it helps when the business owner establishes outside interests creates a sound financial base for retirement and gains confidence in the abilities of the successor estate planning estate planning involves the financial and tax aspects of transferring ownership of the family business to the next generation families must plan to minimize their tax burden at the time of the owners death so that the resources can stay within the company and the family unfortunately tax laws today provide disincentives for families wishing to continue the business heirs are taxed upon the value of the business at a high rate when ownership is transferred due to its complexity estate planning is normally handled by a team of professional advisors who include a lawyer accountant financial planner insurance agent and perhaps a family business consultant an estate plan should be established as soon as the business becomes successful and then updated as business or family circumstances change one technique available to family business owners in planning their estate is known as estate freeze this technique enables the business owner to freeze the value of the business at a particular point in time by creating preferred stock which does not appreciate in value and then transferring the common stock to his or her heirs since the majority of shares in the firm are preferred and do not appreciate estate taxes are reduced the heirs are required to pay gift taxes however when the preferred stock is transferred to them a variety of tools are available that can help a business owner defer the transfer taxes associated with handing down a family business a basic will outlines the owners wishes regarding the distribution of property upon his or her death a living trust creates a trustee to manage the owners property not covered by the will for example during a long illness a marital deduction trust passes property along to a surviving spouse in the event of the owners death and no taxes are owed until the spouse dies it is also possible to pay the estate taxes associated with the transfer of a family business on an installment basis so that no taxes are owed for five years and the remainder are paid in annual installments over a tenyear period other techniques exist that allow business owners to exclude some or all of their assets from estate taxes including a unified creditexemption trust a dynamic trust and an annual exclusion gift since laws change frequently retaining legal assistance is highly advisable assistance in planning a professional family business consultant can be a tremendous asset when confronting planning issues the consultant is a neutral party who can stabilize the emotional forces within the family and bring the expertise of working with numerous families across many industries most families believe theirs is the only company facing these difficult issues and a family business consultant brings a refreshing perspective in addition the family business consultant can establish a family council and advisory board and serve as a facilitator to those two groups advisory boards can be established to advise the companys president or board of directors these boards consist of five to nine nonfamily members who meet regularly to provide advice and direction to the company they too can take the emotions out of the planning process and provide objective input advisory board members should have business experience and be capable of helping the business to get to the next level of growth in most cases the advisory board is compensated in some manner as the family business grows the family business consultant may suggest different options for the family often professional nonfamily managers or an outside ceo are recruited to play a role in the future growth of the business some families simply retain ownership of the business and allow it to operate with few or no family members involved the future of family businesses as tracy perman explains in her business week article entitled taking the pulse of family business two broad trends are visible in the realm of family business as we get comfortable in the st century first the aging of the baby boom generation signals a coming ownership change for many family businesses within the next ten years second more and more of these businesses will be taken over by women continuing a trend that has been visible since the turn of the century perman goes on to highlight some statistics about women owned family businesses that makes this trend towards female ownership seem quite positive recent studies have shown perman explains that womenowned businesses were more likely to focus on succession planning have a  percent lower rate of familymember attrition tend to be more fiscally conservative and carry less debt than maleowned businesses some familyowned businesses are finding that it is no longer assumed that children will wish to take over a family business if the founders of a firm wish to keep it in the familys hands they should be sure to take proactive measures to attract future generations to the business expose family members to all aspects of the business including employees customers products and services define the businesss attractive qualities in terms that will appeal to the listener recognize those factors that have the potential to dissuade family members from staying involved in the business these factors can range from personal interests that lie in other areas to conflicts with other family members reward family members who decide to join or stay with the family business the price successors pay to join and operate a family business may include giving up career options that they find financially and personally attractive it may seem to a new family member coming into a family business that he or she is suffering a loss of privacy conflicts may arise between parent and child when their management styles conflict a business may make compromises—such as making it possible for the successor to spend more time with his or her family or hiring an interim senior manager to buffer conflicts between parent and child but the companys cost and the successors price must be affordable to both give family members outlets to explore their ideas interests and concerns the rewards of a familyowned business are many as are the challenges those family members who manage the family business should enjoy the business itself if they are to be successful and pass along a sense of enthusiasm for the
