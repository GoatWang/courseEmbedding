and interviews with industry leaders this book delivers epiphanies for managers who have lost their way in the ecraze the authors provide a framework for applying more robust and rigorous approaches to financing outsourcing rd company infrastructure and customer relationship management advertising editorial reviews soundview executive book summaries from the beginning of the socalled dotcom bubble there were those who thought the internet to be a revolutionary force for immediate change in the world and those who thought the whole thing was simply speculative mania intended to con the gullible they were both wrong indeed the truth resides somewhere between those two extreme modes of thought  the internet can be a powerful tool if companies and consumers learn how to use it creatively and imaginatively it can open up possibilities for value creation and enhancement heretofore unimagined providing companies with sustainable competitive advantagepart theoretical framework part hard reality knowledgewharton on building corporate value is based on articles and research drawn from the wharton schools online resource knowledgewharton for companies eager to approach their internet ventures like real businesses ie with revenues and the hope of profits the authors write that it is important to analyze both conceptual strategies as well as realworld business models in order to gain the best most powerful competitive edge both are critical to success they explain particularly in the aftermath of the enormous losses in capital investment brought about by the bursting of the dotcom bubble according to the authors those who poured billions into entrepreneurial ventures in the mid to lates recognized the three broad conceptual effects inherent to internet technology communication effect the internet has made it easy to search for and find vast amounts of information in addition to making it much less expensive to store and transfer it note it is less expensive not free  a point overlooked by dotcom investors and entrepreneurs in their relentless drive to attract traffic to their businesses for example many companies that once gave away their content for nothing generating revenues through advertising discovered ads couldnt generate sufficient funds to maintain their businesses brokerage effect some analysts compare the web to a giant market marked by openness informality and interactivity the authors write that this effect makes it possible for internet users to access global markets at minimal cost flattening the playing field enough for small companies to take on large conglomerates for the same customers a good example of this effect is ebay the online auction site whose mission is to help practically anyone trade practically anything on earth it boasts  million registered users  million auction listings and gross merchandise sales of  billion annually integration effect the internet realigns players in industry value chains as some players are disintermediated in the wake of the new technology when the value chain changes the authors write that it provides opportunities to create value in addition the webs ability to connect buyers and sellers directly to one another knocks middlemen out of the value chain by eliminating the need for their participation in transactions the web can also create new intermediaries or infomediaries that mine customer transaction data to make mass customization possible a business model is made up of a companys goals strategies processes technologies and structure  the things that enable an organization to capture and deliver value to customers the authors explain that a business model must have four important elements scalability complementary resources and capabilities relationspecific assets and knowledgesharing routines information assets which dominate ebusiness the authors write are generally costly to produce initially but typically are easy and inexpensive to reproduce exploiting this on the web requires companies to develop scalable business models technological advantages are often shortlived however and the authors point out that those advantages require companies that want to lead in the digital arena to acquire complementary resources capabilities and assets to keep competitors at bay no firm can hope to dominate the internet the authors explain but networks of allied firms can provide competitive advantage for those involved in such alliances particularly if they are adept at managing collaborative relationships and relationshipspecific assets in such collaborations they write effectiveness depends largely on the knowledgesharing routines collaborators develop between one another these routines help partners enhance their collective competitive advantage over rivals and their partners once a company has a strong business model in place the authors write it needs to gain and sustain competitive advantage through leveraging three elements position in opportunity space if firms want to gain competitive advantage over rivals the authors write that they must position themselves appropriately in their markets after the cold war for example defense contractors had to find ways to put their technologies to commercial use to stay afloat in a market that didnt need tools of defense leveraging capabilities according to the authors companies must learn to develop capabilities  the combination of skills resources and knowledge firms bring to the table when they compete  that are unique these capabilities should be difficult to duplicate yet widely applicable across several products and services neutralizing competition as important as it is for companies to position themselves correctly and develop unique capabilities the authors write that they should also adopt strategies that anticipate competitive reactions copyright   soundview executive book summaries show more product details

on building corporate value by mukul pandya harbir singh robert e mittelstaedt jr eric clemons john wiley  sons isbn 8 chapter one a hare a tortoise and the business of buying groceries online inspiration came to louis h borders back in  the cofounder of the borders bookstore chain was reportedly opening a package of japanese spices and specialty foods that he had ordered from a catalog when he realized that internetbased commerce would never take off until someone figured out a way to deliver products to peoples homes simply and inexpensively determined to do just that borders came up with the concept for webvan an internet venture whose ambitious goal was to revolutionize the lowmargin intensely competitive grocery business armed with more than  million in initial funding from bluechip companies such as cbs and knightridder and backing from topnotch silicon valley venture capital firms such as benchmark capital sequoia capital and softbank borders and his associates declared webvan open for business in the san francisco bay area on june   webvan group today set a new standard for internet retailing the company declared in its press release borders then the ceowho was later replaced by george shaheen the former boss of andersen consulting now accenture enthusiastically said webvan fundamentally transforms and simplifies the way customers shop for their groceries as everyone now knows for all its hubris webvan turned out to be one of the internets most spectacular failures after burning its way through more than  billion in two years after its highprofile launch the company declared bankruptcy in july  most of its  employees were let go with minimal notice since then the company has been liquidating its assets borders through one of his companies has petitioned the bankruptcy court to let him buy webvans software technology platform for  million and the assumption of  in debt does webvans icarian flameout mean that the shoppers will never buy fruits and vegetables unless they can touch and smell them in a realworld store and that the online grocery business has no future for part of the answer look across the atlantic ocean to britains biggest retailer tesco which traditionally operated a chain of supermarkets but has lately entered nonfood businesses such as personal finance the companys online arm tescocom was on track to garner  million in revenues in  and analysts estimate its profits from the grocery business to be around  million tescocom is said to have nearly one million registered users 8 orders a year and is expanding into categories such as baby products and wine tescocom claims that it has become the largest and most successful internetbased grocery home shopping service in the world on the surface webvan and tesco had the same goal both companies wanted to harness the power of the web to deliver groceries to shoppers that however is where the similarity ended anyone who compares webvans approach to the online grocery business with tescos will see that each company pursued a strategy that was not just different from the others but poles apart for example while webvan made huge bets on the internets ability to change shoppers behaviors tesco made tiny ones webvan wanted to overthrow the grocery industrys infrastructure and replace it with its own while tesco used the industrys infrastructure to keep costs low webvan spent enormous sums of cash trying to build a brand and a customer base while tesco used its existing brand and customers to drive its online business of course it is also true that tesco began with some crucial advantages visàvis webvan webvan had to build name and scale de novo while tesco could leverage both in addition webvan made its investments in the united states where grocery shopping offers low margins to sellers while tesco began in britain where margins are significantly higher than they are in the united states jerry wind a wharton professor of marketing who explores the actions of both companies in a book titled convergence marketing notes that webvan started with the notion that it would have to do everything from scratch and that a new type of firm would be required to do it but the company did not take into account the logistics issues that were involved he says as such webvan had to create a whole logistics company in contrast tesco followed a simple strategy from the beginning it saw tescocom as one more channel through which to reach its existing customers as well as some new ones it tried to provide a multichannel experience to the customers that it had already attracted that strategy allowed tescocoms online grocery business to thrive it might be worthwhile examining the strategies of webvan and tesco in greater detail to show how those differences led to different results webvan speed kills from the beginning an ambitious winnertakeall attitude marked webvans approach to selling groceries online in the late spring of  just as webvan was getting ready to launch its web site borders told the wall street journal that webvan planned to sell  million worth of groceries a year from a single warehouse in oakland california if it thrives and even if it does not mr borders plans to open another enormous grocery warehouse in atlanta a few months later down the road are plans for at least  more such facilities throughout the united states in practically every city big enough to support a majorleague sports team the wall street journal wrote borders raised an initial  million in venture capital and spent a significant part of it building the stateoftheart warehouse a squarefoot behemoth adorned with five miles of conveyor belts and  million of electrical wiring according to the wall street journal although other online grocers such as peapod were in trouble webvan had high hopes that it would be able to succeed where others had failed because it had invested heavily in hightech infrastructure webvan executives believed that this investment would translate into much higher productivity and that this strategy would enable the company not only to beat out other online grocers but also traditional brickandmortar supermarkets unlike shoppers in traditional grocery stores who moved around aisles with carts webvan workers would stand at automated carousels equipped with nearly  products thanks to its unique technology webvan executives predicted its workers would be  times as productive as traditional shoppersand this scenario would translate into faster profitability borders claimed that the oakland warehouse would be profitable in six to  months while other warehouses might break even in as little as  days i do not see any reason why an internet company should take five to  years to be profitable borders argued if higher worker productivity was one key element of webvans strategy another was its assumption that timestarved shoppers would respond overwhelmingly to the convenience of being able to order products on webvans web site  hours a day and have them homedelivered within a minute window of their choosing this goal the company said would be accomplished by having a fleet of customized delivery vans to handle distribution so efficient would this process be webvan believed that customers would be able to shop at webvan at the same or lower prices as they did at traditional grocery stores prices are up to  percent less on average than typical supermarkets and delivery is free for orders of  or more the company said based on these twin assumptions of superefficient worker productivity and customerfriendly delivery webvan embarked upon aggressive growth after its web site was launched by july  the company announced that it had hired the bechtel group an engineering firm in san francisco to build  highly automated warehouses for  billion each warehouse was to be modeled on the facility in oakland webvan clearly wanted to growand fast a note of caution is in order the desire for massive investments in scale per se is not necessarily a recipe for failure in fact in the drug wholesaling business companies made massive investments to support efficient warehousing operations and customerfriendly distribution and the only survivors in that industry are companies that ramped up their scale rapidly webvan however chose this approach in the grocery business where profit margins are minuscule and the willingness of customers to adopt online grocery shopping in large enough volumes to support the investments in scale was uncertain two factors contributed to webvans aggressive drive for growth the first was the threat of emerging competition peapod with sales of some  million had a head start over webvan in the online grocery market but it was bleeding cash a greater challenge seemed to stem from homegrocer a seattlebased online grocery firm at around the same time that webvan launched its operations amazoncom announced that it had bought a stake in homegrocer the amazonhomegrocer combination could have affected webvans prospects significantly for webvan the way to head off that threat seemed to lie in making a run for dominance webvan executives believed that the threat of competition made the companys drive for market dominance necessary the second factoreasy availability of capitalmade that drive possible in  capital was flowing in tidal waves towards technology and internet companies especially those backed by leading silicon valley venture capitalists such as benchmark capital and sequoia capitalboth of which were solidly in webvans corner that year venturecapital investments reached an alltime high of 8 billion an increase of more than  percent over 8s total according to the nvca and venture economics more than  percent of that capital went to hightech and webbased companies before a company could qualify to grab a piece of that action however it had to convince potential investors that it was willing to live by the internet economys unwritten rule of growing at breakneck speed even if someone at webvan had wanted to first try out its online grocery model in one city improve upon it and then expand to other cities the financial climate of those times would have had little patience with that approach many people involved with internet startups believed that they had a narrow window of opportunity and that they had to act fast before it slammed shut in an interview with the new york times david beirne a venture capitalist with benchmark partners and an early backer of webvan described the situation as a catch we had a unique opportunity to raise a lot of capital and build a business faster than sam walton rolled out walmart he said but in order to raise the money we had to promise investors rapid growth if rapid growth was what webvans investors wanted that is what they got the company began rolling out massive warehouses at a cost of more than  million per warehouse in areas such as suwanee georgia serving the atlanta market and carol stream illinois serving the chicago area smaller distribution centers were set up in areas such as los angeles and san diego among others on november   with hardly a few months of online product sales under its belt webvan went public in a stock offering counderwritten by some of wall streets most blueblooded investment banks goldman sachs merrill lynch bancboston robertson stephens bear stearns  co and salomon smith barney webvan sold  million shares priced at  each but so heady was the buzz surrounding its ipo that the stock soared to a shortlived high of  on its first day of trading giving webvan a market capitalization of  billion over the next year and a half borders and other webvan executives strove mightily to remain true to their vision for the company among its most ambitious moves was to recruit george shaheen the ceo of andersen consulting as webvans ceo with borders taking the chairmans post as the months passed however it became clear that webvan was unable to get away from one simple fact webvan was spending more money on acquiring customers and products and that it could make by selling them some analysts estimate that webvan lost more than  per order including depreciation marketing and other overhead in an attempt to gain economies of scale which might have led to profitability webvan in september  merged with its erstwhile rival homegrocer but that too could not postpone the decline in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission sec webvan reported that in the fiscal year ending december   the company had lost  million on sales of 8 million by april  shaheen had left webvan and the company was scaling back dramatically this change included dropping plans for the construction of new warehouses as well as slashing marketing expenses lowering marketing costs immediately hurt sales even more significantly though these actions added to the perception that webvan was in trouble and that it was unable to stanch its financial hemorrhage goldman sachs meanwhile was making intense efforts to find a buyer or new investors for webvan when these efforts failed webvan had little choice but to announce on july   that it was closing its operations and would declare bankruptcy how flawed assumptions misled webvan in retrospect what did webvan do wrong the companys assumptions led directly to its blunders to recount webvan assumed the following  that a very large number of people would prefer to buy groceries online and have them delivered at home rather than buying them at a physical supermarket this belief led them to reckon that webvans sales would explode and that people would place a high value on not having to go to a physical supermarket  that so much inefficiency existed in the grocery industrys infrastructure that webvan would garner a bigger margin if it rebuilt the whole infrastructure by doing all its own warehousing and logistics and moving further up the value chain by cutting out the wholesalers  that if a web site gave shoppers more choice and a wider selection of products that people would be willing to pay at least the same price if not a premium for the privilege of shopping online as they did in a physical store as time was to show each of these assumptions was wrong webvans biggest mistake was assuming that people did not want to shop in a supermarket continues excerpted from knowledgewharton by mukul pandya harbir singh robert e mittelstaedt jr eric clemons
