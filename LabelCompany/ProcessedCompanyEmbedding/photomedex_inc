about photomedex inc phmd virginia value investor value growth at reasonable price dividend investingsummarymajority of profits are derived from the no no product linesales and consumer interest are falling off a clifflawsuits are starting to pile upif youve ever had a tough time sleeping and stayed up late watching tv youve seen these commercials  the no no hair remover  the painless alternative to shaving plucking waxing source beauty basin what you dont learn about in the commercials is that the product is owned by photomedex nasdaqphmd  a selfproclaimed skin health company photomedex traces its roots back to laser photonics in the s in  through its acculase subsidiary it entered the coronary health market for most of its history the company focused on new and innovative laser technologies for use in professional settings that all changed in  with the merger with radiancy radiancy offered an opportunity to expand into the consumer market with their no no product line despite seeing the commercials ive never been tempted to purchase the product although it seems that many people have photomedex claims that more than  million have been sold unfortunately most of those consumers havent had a good experience if you trust the amazon reviews based on over  ratings the product registers as  stars out of  source amazon not only are customers expressing their distaste for the product through online reviews they are becoming increasingly active in the courts the company is facing multiple class action punitive lawsuits filed in the district of columbia california and israel and it would appear that this is just the start given the terrible customer experience there are multiple websites trying to gather customers for future lawsuits source aaron levine so why does any of this matter well the nono product line represents  of photomedexs revenue and a whopping  of gross profits whatever happens to the nono product will dictate the direction of the overall business and that direction is not going in the right way for shareholders in their last quarterly report photomedex disclosed that total revenue declined  with the consumer segment nono declining  that drove net income to a loss of  million compared to a gain of  million in the year ago period unfortunately for photomedex they havent launched any new consumer products since the disaster they reported last quarter and based on google trends interest in their products continue to decline source google just from the beginning of  google trends show interest in nono down  photomedex will report earnings in early november i suspect that youll see another quarter with the consumer segment down  or more year over year continuing to drive negative profitability with a little over  million of market cap left there is still a good amount to short best guess is that this will be a zero looking at the balance sheet they have  million in cash the next largest asset is inventory  maybe its worth  of the  million they have it on the books for so that gives you a combined  million on the liability side they have  million of debt due in the near term  mostly from a year term loan that comes due in  disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours the author wrote this article themselves

nowgo»photomedex declining sales legal issues and now a stock promotionjan  about photomedex inc phmd hunter straus longterm horizon growth longshort equitysummaryphotomedex has experienced declining sales and negative cash flowthe companys main product is the subject of class action lawsuitsinsiders own over  of the companys common stockthe recent stock promotion is an attempt to generate excitement about the company but there is not much to be excited aboutbackground photomedex nasdaqphmd is best known for its no no hair removal product that is advertised on tv infomercials the company recently acquired lcavision in may of last year but in august it defaulted on the debt that it used to fund the purchase photomedex also filed an s on january  to register an additional  shares of common stock which will dilute current shareholders additionally the company is subject to several classaction lawsuits that allege false advertising and management misconduct among other things on january  the company was the subject of a series of promotional emails from pennystockcircle that resulted in the stock price rapidly appreciating in early trading hours before the price tapered off and actually ended below the opening price on that date management and insider ownership ceo dr dolev rafaeli and dennis m mcgrath president and chief financial officer are both paid pretty well considering the companys financial position  their annual salaries are  and  respectively additionally they are both eligible for bonuses that could nearly double their salaries the top executives and insiders own a total of about  of the companys common stock  not an extreme amount but enough that they could see a substantial payoff if the companys stock were to rapidly appreciate in price business strategy from listening to the companys q  earnings call it feels like the company is living in the past  it is heavily reliant on tv sales to generate directtoconsumer sales and management noted that it is highly dependent on the sale of only one product additionally the company has decreased spending on its advertising campaigns which is most definitely going to have a negative impact on sales the company is attempting to change its business model through its purchase of lcavision but even that business has historically been a moneyloser financials according to the companys most recent form q the company has  million in cash and  million in receivables but it has current liabilities of  million which includes  million in shortterm debt which means that management has to act quickly in order to refinance the debt to avoid a default additionally the companys sales have been faltering as it posted  million in sales for the quarter compared to  million for the same period last year the worst part is that its operations used  million in cash compared to providing  million in the same period last year bad signs all around but the worst part is that management doesnt seem to be in control of the companys finances its never a good sign when the qa section of the companys earnings call opens with the question so the simple question im going to ask is in english given the business where it is today the cash burn that you have how many quarters of cash do you have while management was able to clarify that they expect to have cash through  they were not able to answer effectively when questioned about the companys ability to refinance its debt stating im not going to get real specific there is a process going on we hired an investment banker there is a significant level of interest that preceded our announcement the other day and an additional interest and inquiries as a result of our announcement the other day we rely upon our hired financial advisor to sort through that process we expect as we move through the next couple of months well have more color for you once the board decides on which path to take id like to think that the president and cfo would have a bit more detail on how the company plans to survive through the year and beyond but it seems like they had not even thought about it and tried to push it off as someone elses job beyond the immediate issues on the balance sheet management did not attempt to address the companys legal issues or the default on the debt that happened in the quarter loan defaults as previously mentioned the company defaulted on the terms of its term loan and revolving credit facility that were used to fund the companys purchase of lca from the q on may   the company entered into an  million senior secured credit facilities the facilities with jp morgan chase chase which included a  million revolving credit facility and a  million fouryear term loan the facilities were utilized to refinance the existing term debt with chase fund the acquisition of lca and for working capital and other general corporate purposes there are financial covenants including a maximum leverage covenant and a minimum fixed charge covenant which the company must maintain these covenants will be determined quarterly based on a rolling past four quarters of financial data as of september   the company continued to fail to meet both financial covenants and is in default of the credit facilities on august   the company received a notice of default and a reservation of rights from chase and engaged a thirdparty independent advisor to assist the company in negotiating a longer term solution to the defaults the parties had entered into an initial forbearance agreement the initial forbearance agreement on august   on november   the company entered into an amended and restated forbearance agreement the amended forbearance agreement with the lenders that are parties to the credit agreement and with chase as administrative agent for the lenders as a result of the default the company noted that it has very little to spend on capital expenditures for many of its businesses stating the company agreed to limit certain capital expenditures to  except for those involving the companys xtrac or vtrac medical devices and will not make investments or acquire any other interests in affiliated companies except as agreed to by the lenders this sounds especially troubling  what is the point of having multiple business lines if you are not going to invest in them the company has not mentioned the possibility of divesting the businesses that it cannot invest in and needs to disclose what it plans to do going forward legal proceedings in the legal proceedings section of the companys most recent q there are several classaction lawsuits related to violations of securities laws and claims of false advertising in the companys products the section reads in part on april   a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia against the companys subsidiary radiancy inc and dolev rafaeli radiancys president the suit was filed by jan mouzon and twelve other customers residing in ten different states who purchased radiancys nono hair products it alleges various violations of state business and consumer protection codes including false and misleading advertising unfair trade practices and breach of express and implied warranties the complaint seeks certification of the putative class or alternatively certification as subclasses of plaintiffs residing in those specific states the complaint also seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages preand postjudgment interest and attorneys fees expert witness fees and other costs dr rafaeli was served with the complaint on may   to date radiancy has not been served and on june   the companys subsidiary radiancy inc was served with a putative class action lawsuit filed in the superior court in the state of california county of kern the suit was filed by april cantley who purchased radiancys nono hair products it alleges various violations of state business and consumer protection codes including false and misleading advertising breach of express and implied warranties and breach of the california legal remedies act the complaint seeks certification of the putative class which consists of customers in the state of california who purchased the nono hair devices the complaint also seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages preand postjudgment interest and attorneys fees expert witness fees and other costs radiancy and its officers intend to vigorously defend themselves against this lawsuit discovery has now commenced in this action at this time the amount of any loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated as the case has only been initiated and no discovery has been conducted to determine the validity of any claim or claims made by plaintiffs given that the company is heavily reliant on the sale of its nono product any adverse judgment would have a major impact on sales and the financials of the company conclusion while photomedex doesnt feel like a penny stock scheme it has major problems the companys financials are in pretty rough shape as sales have slid loans have been defaulted on and losses have mounted photomedexs flagship product is the subject of class action lawsuits and is being advertised through a dying medium while the company is attempting to go into another line of business its execution so far has been horrid as it has defaulted on the loans that it acquired to purchase lca the company is burning through cash and management doesnt have any satisfactory answers for investors in its earnings calls additionally it has substantial insider ownership as its eight directors and officers own over  of the outstanding common stock the latest stock promotion seems like a desperate attempt at generating some excitement about the company but there just is not much to be excited about disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
