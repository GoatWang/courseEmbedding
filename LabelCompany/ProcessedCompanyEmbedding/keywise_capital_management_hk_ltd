hong kong sfclicensed and us secregistered asset management firm dedicated to the greater china market our firm is also approved by chinese csrc as qualified foreign institutional investor qfii we believe that there are significant inefficiencies in the greater china equity markets as seen in the undervaluation of stocks periodically we believe that these inefficiencies can be discerned through fundamental research  in particular we consider that investments in equity securities of mid cap companies are attractive due to the lack of fundamental research and analysis focused on such companies  our strong ontheground due diligence will allow us to identify those opportunities keywise capital  fang zheng this website contains information about keywise capital management limited
