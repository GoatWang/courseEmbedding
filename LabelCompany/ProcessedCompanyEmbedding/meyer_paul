beginnings paul j meyer’s extraordinary life and legacy seem unlikely for a boy born into a poor immigrant family in  paul’s parents gave him something far greater than material wealth — they instilled christian values along with strong moral principles a robust work ethic and a burning desire to learn and excel these values and early life lessons were the building blocks for paul’s stellar success paul rose from humble beginnings to great wealth and great achievement gaining acclaim and a host of admiring friends paul was raised in very modest living conditions by his parents who lived in a tent when they first married in  as an adult paul owned multiple homes and lavish beachfront properties in some of the world’s most soughtafter paul’s first bicycle as a young boy was salvaged from a junk yard as an adult he owned luxury automobiles a classic car collection featuring  fords and other rare antique vehicles luxury boats and elite motor coaches paul an avid pilot also flew his own antique piper cub and traveled around the world in private jets paul’s childhood jobs included working in the orchards and vineyards with migrant farm workers working in a cannery trimming trees and digging tree stumps as a young adult paul became a selfmade millionaire who eventually owned dozens of companies both in the us and worldwide after a particularly grueling workday young paul asked his mother “am i going to have to do manual labor all my life” his mother’s insightful response profoundly influenced paul’s life she put her hands on her son’s head looked straight into his eyes and said “you have everything right in here to do anything and be anything you want” paul later said as an adult “at that moment i knew the choice was mine and everything depended on my attitude the world’s abundance was mine to earn and to possess” the life lessons paul learned from his parents didn’t stop with a positive attitude paul’s father a german immigrant was a master craftsman who instilled in his children a standard of excellence in everything they did paul’s mother trained as a teacher and a nurse she nurtured paul’s desire to learn and to teach others and to practice the principles of success in all areas of life paul enthusiastically put into practice all that his parents taught him he used the same positive attitude and “out of the box” thinking to

for the blessings god gave him dr bill m hinson paul’s pastor and friend for more than  years said he often cited philippians  “i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in jesus christ” as motivation for the way he lived his life and his faith paul j meyer believed deeply that the blessings in his life were not his as he famously said it all belonged to god this went beyond his wealth though and paul sought to steward these gifts god gave him through his wife jane and his five children as diligently as he did the money he gave to missions through tithing “it was so refreshing to me as a young pastor to see his commitment his christian commitment to christ affected everything that he did” dr hinson said “it affected his stewardship it affected his martial relationship his family relationship and his testimony stood out because of the way he lived his life day by day” paul j meyer’s faith is reflected in his priorities throughout his life he always listed his priorities in the following order by importance to him god his wife his family his health and fitness and finally his business as paul’s success grew dr hinson said that paul’s actions drew many similarly young and successful professionals to him he became a role model for many in his church as dr hinson pointed out that paul did not become distracted or sidetracked by the temptations that lead many men in his position astray “with paul his commitment was so evident in everything he did” dr hinson said “he felt like with his christian faith and being faithful to his wife and his children he didn’t have time to be distracted by those sins” paul was diligent in the stewardship of his relationship with jane he took time to grow his relationship and model to his children how a godly husband treats his wife and together they showed how a couple keeps god first in their marriage paul also kept his children a priority – ensuring that he was present and an active part of their lives – that he was not just the good father they expected but that he was present as the spiritual head of their home and a great encouragement in their walks with christ in his business paul modeled for his children how to be a christian business leader who used his faith to strengthen his business and used the wealth he gained to further christ’s kingdom the greatest gifts paul j meyer’s parents gave him were an appreciation for the blessings of life the work ethic to use and develop his godgiven abilities and an unshakable faith in the goodness of his creator paul and jane lived out these values through their marriage as they were of one accord holding god first each other second and their families third in their shared priorities and they have passed these gifts on to their children knowing these intangible blessings would continue to benefit them as they had paul and jane     the legacy humble beginnings young leader  entrepreneur industry pioneer christian stewardship faith
