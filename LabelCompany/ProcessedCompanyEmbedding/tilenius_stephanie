positions at paypal ebay and google stephanie was vp of commerce and payments at google where she built google wallet and google shopping express prior to google stephanie was svp of ebaycom and vp of paypal merchant services prior to ebay stephanie founded planetrxcom an online pharmacy and healthcare company that went public in  stephanie sits on two public boards  coach inc and seagate technology stephanie tilenius photo credit courtsey of self q what does entrepreneurship mean to you and what underlying characteristics do you see in successful entrepreneursstephanie entrepreneurship is bringing something to life from a paper napkin it requires resilience and resourcefulness and it requires these everyday you never stop thinking about it although you need to create time when youre not thinking about your vision or your product a certain mental clarity comes to me after a run or playing with my kids and im able to approach opportunities and problems with a fresh perspectiveq what are you most proud of in your professional career if you could do something over in your life what would it be stephanie working with extremely smart and innovative people and teams has been rewarding i remember telling the paypal team that paypal will be bigger than ebay one day and it is gratifying to see this dream come true as for regrets i dont think like that one makes certain choices and then one moves forward in life always learn but always push forward there is always something new to buildq tell us about an instance where you had to go against the flow to realize your goalstephanie when i first pitched paypal going off ebay or paypal merchant services i received mixed reactions from ebay leadership the traditional offline payments business is a low margin business in the us and it took me two years to convince people of the long term return here and that paypal could be larger than ebay it took us two years to sign merchants like dell and walmart similarly i faced naysaying while pitching google shopping express and google wallet but eventually i was able to sell this vision and garner resourcesq how were your experiences different during your intrapreneurial stints at paypalebaygoogle and your entrepreneurial role at vida health stephanie firstly you are insulated in a big company whereas as a startup you need to always be raising money secondly if you have the right support at a big company it is easier and faster to iterate there because you have more resources at hand of course if a large corporation is bureaucratic or you dont have the needed support then things move way faster at a smaller startup its all about starting with the right small team to iterate on a product for example with google wallet we took engineers out of google labs and started with  engineers and a product personthirdly failure at a startup is an extreme because your survival is at stake as a bigger company you can still work on other projects if a project fails q you earned your mba from harvard business school would you advice aspiring entrepreneurs in the present day to pursue business schoolstephanie my hbs experience was enriching because of the people  the students and the professors and id do it again if i were to go back in time that said the pace of innovation in silicon valley is unprecedented and taking two years off for an academic pursuit is a bigger risk today than it was in  this is more of a statement about the valley than it is about the mba education if you are in a traditional industry id strongly encourage you to apply to hbs q if you were to give advice to your  year old self what would it bestephanie have a longterm vision for what you want to be but dont get caught up in the details of a specific plan leave some room for serendipity also know and manage your weaknesses but focus on your strengths and let these make you stand out follow your passions but take calculated risk make sure you are making the world a better place ask yourself what impact am i having on the people and world around mefollow stephanie tilenius at stilenius and check out the other interviews

including running the merchant service group of its powerful paypal payments unit and also on its key marketplace offering tilenius took an even more prominent operating role when she joined google and ended up shepherding google wallet one of the search giant‚Äôs most significant efforts in commerce tilenius‚Äôs first job at google was leading its commerce efforts and in product search but she founded google wallet as a kind of skunkworks within the company it is now part of an integrated offering in which users have a onepayment account to cover purchases across android market youtube google games and other of the company‚Äôs properties ‚Äúwe have built one wallet in the cloud‚Äù she said tilenius was one of the main executives to unveil google wallet at an event in new york last year she also demonstrated the product at our d all things digital conference in  tilenius had also been the key player in google‚Äôs unsuccessful attempt to buy groupon after that google then launched google offers to compete with the daily deals site the various payments initiatives by google also attracted controversy when paypal filed suit against tilenius ‚Äî¬†as well as osama bedier google‚Äôs vp of payments and former paypal executive¬†the payments unit of ebay claimed they and google misappropriated trade secrets and violated contracts involving recruiting agreements in january tilenius shifted roles to oversee google‚Äôs commerce efforts internationally perhaps by coincidence since the firm has been talking about bringing her in for months tilenius is the second major hire

megan quinn as a partner to focus on consumer internet investments kleiner recently filed an answer to pao‚Äôs legal action maintaining it was her own performance that kept her from advancing at the firm tilenius declined to comment on the case at kleiner tilenius will be working closely with a number of partners although she will be focusing on latestage companies in its  billion digital growth fund she also might be incubating some ideas of her own she said kleiner partner ted schlein said tilenius would be a ‚Äútremendous resource‚Äù for the firm ‚Äúwhen talent becomes available to focus on different opportunties in portfolio we jump at that‚Äù he said ‚Äústephanie has the experience in some of the largest scaling of businesses in the valley as well as an entrepreneurial background so it is ideal for us‚Äù tilenius said the move was ‚Äúless about google than working on the next generation of companies‚Äù she said she had some ideas in mobile commerce especially given her experience at google and ebay as well as in the healthcare area ‚Äúi think it is really early days in mobile and retail is going to be transformed‚Äù said tilenius ‚Äúthere are a lot of players but it is a
