means committee in an effort to illustrate the kind of impact he is having as this countrys chief trade spokesman wide grin mock swagger he related the tale with a wide grin and a bit of mock swagger and he could not have had a more appreciative audience given the strong protectionist pressures in their constituencies the legislators seem to have a strong affinity for a macho man as the nations trade representative especially one who can head off punitive protectionist legislation through negotiated agreements i admire the way you handle the job said representative j j pickle democrat of texas youre a breath of fresh air in this administration added representative beryl anthony jr democrat of arkansas mr yeutter goes down less smoothly abroad europeans find the deadlines that he is always setting to resolve trade conflicts unhelpful said ella krucoff spokeswoman for the european community in washington but she added he is respected by european officials mr yeutter a beefy nebraskan who speaks rapidly off the cuff and in a voice that some have compared to a hogcallers occasionally puts his foot in his mouth at least in the judgment of his critics last week for example he created a firestorm in canada when he told a brookings institution seminar that canada should be prepared to risk losses of its culture in any free trade pact with the united states stunningly ignorant the incident caused barely a ripple here but it filled canadian newspapers and in parliament prime minister brian mulroney accused mr yeutter of being stunningly ignorant of canadian cultural sensitivities the canadians fear being economically and culturally overwhelmed by the united states should a freer trade agreement emerge between the two countries later this year in  months in office mr yeutter has managed to become one of the more effective holders of the key cabinetlevel trade office in spite of or perhaps because of his directness he does not have a close personal relationship with president reagan yet he has especially good rapport with treasury secretary james a baker d the cabinets economic spokesman and chairman of the economic policy committee where the key decisions are taken of more than  issues that have come before the policy committee since mr yeutter replaced bill brock now labor secretary in july  only one of mr yeutters recommendations was rejected this related to shoes along with most other economic officers of the cabinet key legislators and the international trade commission a federal factfinding agency mr yeutter recommended protection for the shoe industry the president went against the advice in a decision in september  yeutters been able to work well within the economic policy framework said i m destler senior fellow at the institute for international economics as the guy in the middle between the hill on the one hand and the foreign governments on the other hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances on his watch mr yeutter has seen the trade deficit reach into the stratosphere and protectionist clamor grow in response the administration has shifted from a policy of strictly free trade to a politically more realistic policy of trade enforcement thanks to an initiative of mr yeutter and commerce secretary malcolm baldrige the administration is fighting unfair trade for the first time under section  of the trade act of  this rarely used provision allows washington to restrict access to the american market for countries that maintain trade barriers against the united states more than a dozen such cases have been brought as a result markets in japan have been opened for tobacco markets in taiwan have been opened for beer wine and tobacco and markets in south korea have been opened for insurance to the extent that congressmen are convinced that administration officials will vigorously defend us trade interests the more likely it is that they will desist from imposing unilateral trade restrictions on their own said sam nakagama a wall street economic analyst talks on global trade in another key move to deflate protectionism at home mr yeutter persuaded  nations to agree to start discussing ways to ease global trade and these talks are now moving forward here again the idea is that if other countries open their markets the united states can avoid having to close its own working with mr baker and mr baldrige he has also altered the administrations legislative strategy last year the president refused to send congress a trade bill next week he will send up nearly  pages of legislation both to sharpen trade law and improve competitiveness last year there was such a thrust toward protectionism that we saw no real possibility of sensible responsible trade legislation emerging mr yeutter said in an interview it would have been christmastreed with protectionism and a veto would have been inevitable we came to a different conclusion this year chances of responsible legislation are

before goodwin schroeder and noonan circuit judges schroeder circuit judge  this is an action challenging the constitutionality of the columbia river gorge national scenic area act  usc §§ p which was enacted in  its purposes were to protect the economy and enhance the scenic cultural recreational and natural resources of the columbia river gorge the gorge occupies a uniquely beautiful and rich area in oregon and washington bordering the columbia river the act contemplated interim management of the area by the secretary of agriculture and longterm management by the columbia gorge commission an agency to be established by a compact between the two states  usc § c the act set forth in some detail the manner in which the commission was to function and conditioned congress consent to the compact upon compliance with those conditions the compact has now been entered into and the commission is functioning according to the plan outlined in the act  the plaintiffs in this action individual property owners an organization called the columbia gorge unitedprotecting people and property and members of that organization claimed they were adversely affected by the operation of the commission they sued both the secretary of agriculture and the commission alleging that the act violated both the federal and state constitutions following a hearing on the merits the district court granted summary judgment in a thoughtful opinion rejecting all of the plaintiffs claims columbia river gorge united is the sole appellant in this action as it is the only party below that listed its name on the notice of appeal thereby complying with the specificity requirement of fedrappp c see benally v hodel  fd   th cir in this appeal columbia river gorge united renews its contentions that the act violates the united states constitution alleging specifically that the act violates the tenth amendment the commerce property and compact clauses and the fifth amendment entitlement to equal protection  underlying all of appellants contentions is the recurring theme that the act and the compact are contrary to the true wishes of the states of oregon and washington and that the states were coerced into accepting conditions laid down by congress the commission in this case is represented by the attorneys general of both states who vigorously maintain that both the act and the compact were a product of mutual cooperation between federal and state governments to achieve a result satisfactory to both states to the extent that appellants arguments rest upon issues of fact with respect to coercion they have been resolved against the plaintiffs by the district court in findings which are not clearly erroneous we therefore deal only with issues of law operation of the act  the act establishes a partnership between the federal government the states of oregon and washington and the nearly  units of local government within the columbia river gorge for the purpose of protecting and enhancing property and resources within the gorge  congrec  oct   remarks of senator hatfield the act accomplishes this goal by creating the columbia river gorge national scenic area and ratifying an interstate compact between washington and oregon which regulates land use and development activities within the scenic area  the act calls for the creation of a thirteen member commission composed of three residents appointed by the three oregon gorge counties three residents appointed by the three washington gorge counties three members appointed by each state governor and one nonvoting forest service employee appointed by the secretary of agriculture  usc § c once created the commission is charged with the development of a management plan that regulates through land use ordinances the development and use of various categories of land within the scenic area in furtherance of this purpose the commission is within the first year of its establishment to complete a resource inventory an economic opportunity study and a recreational assessment of the scenic area  usc § da within two years the commission is to complete land use designations for privately owned land within the scenic area  usc § db the secretary of agriculture will during this same period take corresponding steps with respect to federally owned land within the scenic area  usc § f  once these tasks are accomplished the commission is to develop and adopt a management plan for the scenic area under the act the plan must include land use designations management direction for the use of federal land and guidelines for adoption of land use ordinances after the plan is approved by the secretary of agriculture counties will be instructed to submit land use ordinances to the commission for approval if a county fails to submit an acceptable plan the commission is authorized to develop and implement a county plan that is consistent with the overall management plan  under the act and the resulting compact all land use within the columbia river gorge scenic area whether private federal or local will be consistent with the management plan developed by the commission congressional consent to this interstate compact is expressly contingent upon inclusion in the compact of all powers and responsibilities assigned to the commission under the act  usc § od  the columbia river gorge compact was ratified by oregon and washington in  the compact incorporated the gorge act and established the commission in accordance with the federal statute orrevstat §   washrevcode §   discussion  we deal first with the appellants contentions that the act violates the authority granted to congress in both the commerce and property clauses of the constitution and is therefore outside the scope of the legislative power granted to congress by the united states constitution  the commerce clause article i section  of the constitution provides that congress shall have power  to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states the clause has of course been interpreted expansively to authorize regulation not only of channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce but of activities affecting commerce see eg hodel v virginia surface mining and reclamation assn  us    s ct    l ed d   similarly activity that is seemingly insignificant may be regulated where one individuals contribution taken together with that of many others similarly situated is far from trivial wickard v filburn  us    s ct    l ed   the district court correctly disposed of appellants contention that the act goes beyond this expansive power  the district court found and appellant does not dispute that among congress concerns was a desire to preserve the beauty of the area for those who would travel to use the rivers and mountains in it for recreation thus directly causing interstate travel congress also intended to regulate competing economic activities within the scenic area that are activities directly affecting interstate commerce these activities include logging and fishing moreover and perhaps most important the area itself is unique in that it consists of portions of two states bisected by a navigable waterway in such an area virtually all activities affecting the land the economy the environment or the resources have interstate ramifications see united states v appalachian elec power co  us    s ct    l ed   congressional authority to regulate rivers is not limited to control for navigation but is as broad as the needs of commerce and extends to flood protection watershed development and the recovery of cost of improvements see also boone v us  fd   th cir federal governments authority to regulate navigable waters is coextensive with and parallel to expansive power to regulate commerce generally interstate bodies of water are frequently the subject of interstate compacts see eg tahoe regional planning compact publ no   stat   delaware river basin compact publ no   stat   upper colorado river basin compact  stat   there is thus no merit to the appellants claim on appeal that by upholding the constitutionality of the compact we are upholding the authority of congress to impose zoning regulations throughout the country as the district court noted congress found this area to be one of critical national significance  appellant also contends that the act goes beyond the grant of authority to congress under the property clause of the constitution which provides that congress has power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states us const art iv §  cl  appellant argues that even though some seventeen percent of the land in the affected area is federally owned congress may not regulate development in the entire area the district court agreed with appellees that development on nonfederally owned land has a sufficient effect on federally owned land to justify regulation of such development under the property clause they relied upon supreme court decisions which upheld federal regulation of nonfederal land where the regulated activity on the nonfederal land affected the activities on the federal land see kleppe v new mexico  us    s ct    l ed d   camfield v united states  us    s ct    l ed   in addition the united states points out that it is difficult to see how the entire act could be struck down by an attack on only those portions affecting nonfederal land since the act has a severability clause we need not determine however whether all or a portion of the act would go beyond the reach of congress power under the property clause we have already determined that the act is within congress power under the commerce clause  for a similar reason the act cannot be a violation of the tenth amendment since the act is within the powers granted to congress under the commerce clause it cannot constitute an exercise of a power reserved to the states we therefore need not address the federal governments position that the appellant lacks standing to assert the rights of the states under the tenth amendment  we then turn to the appellants contention that the regulatory system is a product of a compact that is not valid under the compact clause under the compact clause us const art i §  cl  any interstate agreement that increases the political power of states must be approved by congress the relevant inquiry must be one of impact on the federal structure united states steel corp v multistate tax commn  us    s ct    l ed d   all parties to this appeal agree that the compact between washington and oregon pursuant to which the commission was established to oversee the columbia river gorge area is one which requires such congressional consent through the act congress consented in advance to this compact on the condition that the compact contain certain specific provisions advance consent with requirements attached is itself perfectly valid as the supreme court has held cuyler v adams  us    s ct    l ed d   this court has recently reaffirmed that congress may condition consent upon a compact containing specific terms including the creation of a compact agency see seattle master builders v pacific nw elec power  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d    the only distinction between seattle master builders and this case is the appellants assertion that this act specifies in greater detail the provisions of the compact it authorizes than the pacific northwest power planning and conservation act at issue in seattle master builders the fundamental objection to both this compact and that in seattle master builders however is essentially the same moreover there are distinct benefits from the kind of detailed advance planning between states and the federal government that led to this compact such planning is fully consistent with the purpose of the compact clause regional arrangements may represent a necessary method for handling problems such as transportation waste disposal and environmental preservation which because of their interstate nature cannot be handled by individual states acting alone professors landis and frankfurter in their seminal article on the compact clause strongly recommended the compact device for fashioning new instruments adapted to new situations frankfurter  landis the compact clause of the constitutiona study in interstate adjustments  yale lj    foresighted in their thinking the authors understood that imaginative adaptation of the compact idea should add considerably to resources available to statesmen in the solution of problems presented by  growing interdependence id at  as we pointed out in seattle master builders the compact has been used in a variety of unique situations to promote both state and federal interests an unusual feature of a compact does not make it invalid seattle master builders  fd at  the columbia river gorge compact is just such an innovative solution to a difficult interstate land preservation problem  the appellant finally contends that the act violates the fifth amendment entitlement to equal protection because gorge area residents must submit to local land use decisions made by nonelected officials while state residents outside the gorge area are subject to land use regulation only by elected officials insofar as the appellant argues that the act violates electoral rights guaranteed by the state constitutions or local laws this challenge fails when congress acting within constitutional limits creates federal law state law is nullified to the extent that compliance with both the federal and the state law would be a physical impossibility hillsborough county fla v auto med labs  us    s ct    l ed d    the equal protection challenge lodged by the appellant is based upon geographic discrimination residents outside the gorge area get to vote for their landuse planners while those inside the gorge area do not the equal protection clause however is not violated when a geographic area is singled out for different treatment the supreme court has held that there is no rule that counties as counties must be treated alike the equal protection clause relates to equal protection of the laws between persons as such rather than between areas  griffin v county school bd of prince edward county  us    s ct    l ed d   quoting salsburg v maryland  us    s ct    l ed   different treatment of different areas is permissible provided there are reasons for such treatment that do not reflect unconstitutional motivations griffin  us at   sct at  preservation of the columbia river gorge area is a permissible congressional objective and a valid exercise of the power delegated to congress under the commerce clause of the constitution  affirmed clayton k yeutter phd executive profile  biography  bloomberg july    pm et capital markets company
