shakespeares plays adds an entirely new dimension to the enjoyment and fuller appreciation of his work although he wrote thirtyseven magnificent plays few people other than english and drama majors are familiar with more than a handful of them yet all his plays are intricately plotted and among them they contain all the elements of great fiction romance comedy tragedy intrigue dramatic climaxes surprise twists and denouements war murder rape incest mystery madness revenge deadly duels the clash of mighty opposites noble sacrifices tyranny villainous plots horror superstition the supernatural mistaken identity religion miracles panoramic epics history hilarity delight farce sagacity and the worlds greatest love stories including deadly triangles suicides dark rendevous pandered love sizzling sensuality jealousy starcrossed lovers summer love eternal love and even the inimitable falstaff in love by order of queen bess although shakespeare did say men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love his great love stories give that quip the lie now fortunately you dont have to go to school and take a class in english lit to understand and enjoy shakespeare here are the worlds most memorable plays in everyday english in easy highly readably novel form written initially for the student and the playgoer yes but really for anyone seeking a great story shakespeare as youve never known him except that ironically this time you will know himshakespeares hamlet the novel hamlet a prince facing an impossible dilemma is shakespeares most complex character his uncle has usurped the throne of denmark and married his mother while he must set things right he can act only in accordance with his own strict sense of honor and justice and he is more a philosopher than a man of action yet as he fights an uphill battle in the midst of all the undercurrents of political intrigue his loss of ophelia is what defeats him in the end i used to tell students that there were a hundred a number picked out of the air legitimate ways to interpret hamlet as long as one based his or her interpretation on the text although it does not have to be absolutely literal as there is much implied by the action or inferred from reading between the lines what a villain ignorant or selfdeluded characters says does not always have to be taken literally much of how we view life depends on who we are our age gender sexual orientation nationality religion personal experience education our innate sense of justice etc some decide to interpret hamlets actions in the context of elizabethan england some judge him as they would a contemporary i believe that shakespeare would be perfectly comfortable with either certainly there is little help from the experts for critics run the gamut and no two directors have ever produced the same hamlet in fact dont we often go to the play or movie for the express purpose of seeing just how the director or star is going to interpret hamlet i am more of the generation of the incomparable olivier and gielgud though lately branagh gibson and klein among many others have produced very exciting hamlets as have many notable theaters in the us canada and england in fact like so many of his characters shakespeare has drawn prince hamlet so real that we view him accordingly the bard reveals the real clue to hamlets actions in one line in the play to thine own self be true in other words hamlet cannot be other than himself nor can any of us just as we are trapped by all those factors that make us who we are when we face what fate presents to us so it was with prince hamlet and polonius and ophelia and gertrude and claudius edetailsseriesshakespeare novelssizelength inheight inwidth inweight oz
