corporate update epic as a shareholder orientated company is going to provide a series of corporate updates to inform its shareholders and potential shareholders about epc and epic medicors activitieswe believe it is important to give a brief history of epic and its present transfer of the acufab business to epic medicor corporationhistoryepic was incorporated in  as a fabless semiconductor company since that time to  epic subsidiaries were focused on developing electronic products products developed include an internet gateway for used in the power industry to gather and transfer information through the internet an rf transmitter and receiver a digital timer and controller to be used in conjunction with equipment and other devises these products have generated limited sales because they lacked significant market potentialduring that time epic engaged in several different businesses through subsidiaries and established alliances with rd party small companies but epic and the subsidiaries have always lacked sufficient resources and personnel in order to growepic medicor corporationin september  epics management was presented with an opportunity to produce a one of a kind fabric acufab which gives the ability to produce unique products that can be sold in existing consumer home healthcare and healthcare markets epics management with a vision of acufabs potential changed its business model to focus  on acufab and its potential use in several significant market segments changing total direction and with the consultation of market and industry experts mr tucker applied for a patent on the fabric further consultants advised him to wait to build an organization until he received the patentepics management incorporated epic medicor corporation in december  to become the entity to house the acufab business and become the product orientated companyon april st  mr tucker received the patent from the united states patent officewhat is unique is that the patent is on the fabric and not a particular product the patent will attach to all products made with acufab during the time between the application for and receiving the patent epics management with limited funds became educated about the fabric the products that could be made from it how acufab and its products are different from similar products in defined market segments determine the effectiveness of various products and how to market the fabric and its productsepics management in conjunction with consultants discovered that the fabric produces effective products however to get a volume of sales we are focusing on oems who make similar products and products that can use the fabric this is the result of testimonials of users of hundreds of sample productsepic as a financial services company is transferring its acufab business to epic medicor at this time to build epic medicor with the acufab business and enable it to raise the capital required to grow its businessacufab is a proprietary one of a kind fabric that is now confirmed by users that it produces better blood flow to injured areas and air ventilation when lying down sitting in a chair driving
