crispr therapeutics ag  press release crispr therapeutics announces european patent for crisprcas gene editing basel  patent to include crisprcas gene editing compositions for use in any noncellular and cellular setting including human and other eukaryotic cells crispr therapeutics nasdaqcrsp reported that the european patent office epo has announced its intention to grant a patent broadly covering crisprs inlicensed gene editing technology the claims are directed to the crisprcas singleguide gene editing system for uses in both noncellular and cellular settings including in cells from vertebrate animals such as human or mammalian cells  as well as composition claims for use in any setting including claims for use in a method of therapeutic treatment of a patient were very pleased with the decision by the european patent office recognizing the broad applicability of our foundational ip and we look forward to pursuing additional cases to grant in other jurisdictions globally said dr rodger novak ceo of crispr therapeutics the european patent application no  was the subject of numerous thirdparty observations or tpos filed by the broad institute and others attempting to prevent or delay its grant following review of those submissions the epo determined that the technical evidence and associated legal arguments did not alter patentability of the inventions by the applicants and accordingly announced its intention to advance the case to grant in europe the full epo case files tpos and claims intended for grant are available online via the epos official website at httpsregisterepoorgapplicationnumberep the underlying international patent application is based on the same us priority application that has been involved in an interference proceeding with the broad et al which priority application ussn  was filed on may   on behalf of crisprs cofounder dr emmanuelle charpentier currently a director at the maxplanck institute in berlin along with the regents of the university of california and university of vienna the united kingdoms intellectual property office ukipo has also examined the related applications and likewise considered technical evidence and arguments submitted by third parties before ultimately reaching similar conclusions to those of the epo the ukipo granted a first uk patent to the crisprcas singleguide gene editing system for uses in both noncellular and cellular settings no  and a second uk patent to chimeric crisprcas systems in which the cas protein is modified to provide alternative dnamodulating activities no  we and the licensors of these foundational cases for crisprcas gene editing have long appreciated that emmanuelle charpentier along with jennifer doudna and their doctoral and postdoctoral colleagues provided innovations that facilitated the crispr field said dr tyler dylanhyde chief legal officer of crispr therapeutics we also appreciate that despite attempts by third parties to delay or prevent these grants through tpos or potential oppositions patent offices are beginning to recognize both the fundamental significance of the teachings by the charpentierdoudna team and their wide applicability to crisprcas gene editing noted dr dylanhyde we look forward to pursuing similar findings in the us under the firsttoinvent system  and throughout the approximately  other countries our filings cover worldwide including europe all of which are on a firsttofile priority system about crispr therapeutics crispr therapeutics is a leading
