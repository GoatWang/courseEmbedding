you may begin kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thank you good morning and thanks for joining us for the jack henry  associates first quarter fiscal  earnings call im kevin williams cfo and on the call with me today is jack prim our ceo the agenda for the call this morning is jack will start with some his thoughts about the business and the performance of the quarter then i will provide some additional comments regarding the press release and the earnings we put out yesterday after the market closed and then as normal we will open the lines up for qa i need to remind you that remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations events objectives strategies trends or results constitute forwardlooking statements or deal with expectations about the

and uncertainties and the company undertakes no obligations to update or revise these statements for a summary of these risk factors and additional information please refer to yesterdays press release and the sections in our k entitled risk factors and forwardlooking statements with that ill now turn the call over to jack john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer thanks kevin good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year  we are pleased to again be able to report a solid performance for the quarter revenue growth was strong at  although direct yearoveryear comparisons to specific revenue components especially license fees are less meaningful due to the priorperiod restatements and new revenue recognition procedures perhaps the most noteworthy takeaway regarding revenue is that license fees now have a minimal impact on our revenue making up less than  of the total in the last quarter while our largest revenue category support and services represented  and recurring revenue represented  of the total outsourcing and payments again showed strong growth as did inhouse maintenance based primarily on new credit union core system implementations even with the continued movement of existing inhouse customers to outsourcing we held our annual banking and credit union user conferences in the quarter and had record combined attendance with over  bank and credit union executives in attendance including representatives from  prospective core customers customers were excited to see the progress on our various core product enhancement initiatives and the influence of the recently acquired banno team on our mobile and electronic delivery channel solutions they were also appreciative that the new tilarespa regulatory changes related to mortgage loan disclosures were delivered on time for all jha systems for the required october implementation date this was a massive development and deployment initiative that had to be delivered on a very short timeline our sales team finished the quarter right at  of sales plans pipelines look solid and combined with the user sentiment at the conferences we look forward to continued progress with that ill turn it over to kevin for a closer look at the numbers kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thanks jack as jack mentioned with the change in revenue recognition our license revenue as reported is now clearly immaterial as it represents less than  of our revenue remember that the vast majority of what used to be considered license revenue is now included in the bundled services which is included in the support and services line of revenue support and services line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth as it increased to  million which is a  increase over the same quarter a year ago of  million and again represented  of our total revenue in both years support and services breakdown for the quarter compared to the prior year – implementation services of  million compared to  million was a decrease of  for the quarter compared to a year ago our electronic payments was  million compared to  million which is an increase of  for the quarter outlink which is our – outlink data services was  million compared to  million or a  increase for the quarter pretty much in line with what we did last fiscal year our inhouse maintenance was  million versus  million or an increase of  and bundled services was up slightly to  million versus  million last year our hardware decreased  for the quarter to  million from  million last year our consolidated gross margins improved to  for the quarter compared to  in last years fiscal year license margins were  for the quarter support and service margins were steady at  compared to prior year quarter and our hardware margins improved slightly to  from  a year ago due to sales mix our total operating expenses increased  for the quarter compared to a year ago and our operating margin for the quarter increased slightly to  compared to  a year ago the effective tax rate for the quarter increased to  from  the first quarter yearago which this increase primarily was due to an increase in effective state rate for the quarter compared to a year ago net income was up  to  million which led to eps of  per share which was up  over last years eps of  ebitda for the year to date increased to  million compared to  million last year or an  increase right in line with net income growth depreciation and amortization expense of  million with  million in depreciation and  million in amortization compared to  million last year included in total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which is down slightly to  million compared to  million a year ago operating cash flows were up  million to  – or a  increase to  million for the year to date primarily due to the timing of collections of our annual maintenance billings we continue to invest in our company both through capex and cap software on new and existing products and we continue to return to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks our return on equity for the trailing  months is right at  return we also purchased just over  million shares for the treasury in the first quarter as far as guidance our guidance has not changed from that that we gave at the beginning of the year on the last call revenue is still projected to grow in the upper midsingledigits for the year but remember to consider the impact of the revenue and margins for the quarter is due to the change in the revenue recognition and the impact of bundling services which drove the compound revenue during the year impacting the total revenue and margins in each of the quarters we continue to anticipate a slight leverage on operating margin for the year however remember the projected effective tax rate for fy  is  up from  last year since we still can assume that the re credit will be reinstated or repeated this increase in tax rate will be mostly offset by any positive impact on stock purchase during the year obviously if the re credit is repeated then we will revise our guidance accordingly also i would like to remind you for the second fiscal quarter that we end now last year had a one timegain on sales from assets that came from the goldleaf acquisition combine that with the effective tax rate in our second quarter last year was  compared to the expected  for this year and adjusting for just those tow items an applestoapples basis we would have reported  eps last year against the current consensus estimate of  this year which is probably a little aggressive also considering we had a couple of pennies positive eps impact in the first quarter this year that we anticipated to happen in the second quarter from term fees which are total term fees for the quarter was  million this quarter compared to  million last year that concludes our opening comments we are now ready to take questions juliana will you please open the call lines up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of glenn greene from oppenheimer your line is now open glenn e greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker hi thanks good morning guys could you just sort of help delineate the very very strong growth and margins on the credit union business and were the term fees part of that and conversely the banking business looked a little bit soft and then i had a couple of followups john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer yeah glenn i think primarily the credit union numbers are just a result of we had some – several very strong sales years i think in the fiscal year we implemented six credit unions there were  billion and assets so we continue to have good momentum i think the credit union progress was one of the reasons that you saw our software maintenance numbers grow even though again we continue to see a steady progression of existing inhouse customers moving to outsourcing so i think its just basic fundamental business on the credit union side thats continued to grow do you have anything youd add to that kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yes other thing i would add glenn is part of it is impacted a little bit by the bundling of services which just comes down to kind of the timing of delivery of the last products that we have talked about in the last couple of calls so it had a nice impact on that which the opposite happened to the banking the bundling services for banking was down about  million and the bundling for services for credit unions is up is a little  million but even if you back that out our credit union revenue growth was still a little over  but still extremely solid growth on a yearoveryear basis glenn e greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker and if you think about it for the year sort of talk about the revenue growth of the upper mid single digits how would you sort of so we know the deal with accounting for the bundling services on a full year basis how would you think about the growth for credit union versus banking kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer i think credit union is going to outpace banking by little bit but the timing of billing sources is just hard to predict glenn it is what it is just comes down to when that last product is delivered and its tough to anticipate what impact thats going to be i stand behind the guidance of our revenue in the mid – upper mid single digits and credit unions is going to outpace banking just a little bit glenn e greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay then john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer i wouldnt think that certainly glenn that it would be at a  in applestoapples growth rate rest of the world kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer no absolutely no glenn e greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay and then the bigger picture question maybe just broadly the spending trend you are seeing the booking trend you had in the quarter and pipeline going forward and one of your peers talked about somewhat slowdown in discretionary spending maybe from bigger banks but have you seen anything like that john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer we have not glenn again as i mentioned the sales team were right at  and they just finished their fifth consecutive year of all three brands making – obtaining  of their assigned quota and this is usually a pretty challenging quarter as first quarter of our fiscal year so there is a certain amount of rushing to close everything if you can in the fourth quarter but – so to come up with  performance in q is certainly i think a good sign i think the other thing is that the pipelines were up not only compared to where they were a year ago they were also up compared to where we were at the start of the fourth quarter so to be up after again that big push in q is a little unusual and it wont – again it went up a tremendous amount but i would have been happy with flat so i think generally the fundamentals look pretty solid at this point kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer the other thing to remember glenn is jack mentioned the two user education conference we just had for jha banking and symitar we had record attendance at the symitar meeting we had close to record attendance on the banking side it was the highest in years actually the highest i believe since the recession and the number of prospects that we had at both the user meetings was close to record so that is always a good indication when people are willing to send their people to an education conference to get more exposure to our product thats always a good thing for us to come out of there and also to have a large number of prospects attend both of those glenn e greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker and then just a final one and ill jump back in the queue but do you guys have any impact from any big bank ma thats been announced i mean there has been a couple of notable ones but i dont know if you were on either side of those equations john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer no nothing new glenn the ones that ive seen in the last several months are – i mean certainly we have some banks that are involved with ma but we talked about susquehanna we talked about cit  a year or so ago but certainly glenn e greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker so nothing like first niagara keybank any of those kind of things john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer no none of those are impactable to us glenn e greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay great thanks guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of tim willi from wells fargo your line is now open timothy wayne willi  wells fargo securities llc hi thanks good morning i apologize since im talking here a bit late so if i ask something that was covered just tell me to take it offline but could you talk a bit about just sort of again the whole network hosting solution that you guys have rolled out and i know youve just got a handful of customer there but any color around interest levels or anything along that nature and then also just i know its a multiyear type of outlook but maybe you could just talk a bit about the scalability of that if momentum builds and it takes off kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yeah tim we are continuing to see strong interest there number of implementations are growing its going to be a compounding effect before that comes in meaningful revenue line item but we are seeing good growth i would tell you that thus far year to date in terms of the number of units number of institutions that we had expected from  behind what we thought we would be but actually the size some of the institutions has been larger than we expected it would be so if you look at the sales margin dollars that we expected to book we are actually ahead of where we expected to be even though the number of actual units number of actual financial institutions is less than we thought that it might be at this point but we see very good interest there was a lot of discussion around those topics at the user conference the emphasis on regulatory agencies on cyber security is continuing to ramp up and thats again we think going to be a tailwind for this type of service so again probably a little – a year or two away from this becoming a noteworthy line item in terms of how it shows up in the financials but were very pleased with where it is at this point timothy wayne willi  wells fargo securities llc great and then just on capital and again if you hit on this in glenns questions i missed it i apologize but just any thoughts around how the ma environment looks like i mean it looks like in the tech world lots of – it seems like people are trying to scramble for exits of sales theres maybe talk of the cost of capital going up and the valuations in the marketplace obviously continuing to expand have you seen any change around books coming across your desks andor seller valuations continuing to stretch out are they starting to flatten out in terms of what they are looking for versus a year ago john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer we have not seen any change in expectations of what properties should sell for tim i think deal flow books coming across our desk nothing noteworthy to mention there we dont take the approach of lets just bolt on revenue and buy something just because its available for sale et cetera if its a good strategic fit if it fits with our sales distribution channel if its a product that that is something our customers need and we can leverage it through those channels then certainly we would give it a look but most of what we are seeing continues not to meet those guidelines and frankly the few that we have seen in recent history that did fall into those guidelines the other challenge there was the expectation around selling price and i dont know that has moderated yet timothy wayne willi  wells fargo securities llc okay and then kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer having said that tim we have an untapped credit facility that we would love to find the right acquisition so we will continue to look for them timothy wayne willi  wells fargo securities llc yes no obviously you guys have a great balance sheet versus the industry which is not in bad shape but you obviously are about as pristine as it gets right now just a last one and ill hop off in the payment business and sort of tying into emv and i guess more broadly security i mean we do hear a lot around the payments companies finding some uptick in not just emv revenue which might be sort of transitory but also just enhanced security around their payment business their payment cards et cetera are you seeing any of that is that something thats picked up or do you think that could pick up in that payment business i dont know if it would be in that line item or a different line item but just any thoughts there thanks john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer tim the emv numbers – there is – first of all we are not in the card production business so there is no card production or no meaningful card production revenue i mean we work with outside card manufacturers and while there may be a little bit of a market there its not a meaningful number so from the emv card production nothing there there may be some very slight upticks in some of the processing fees around emv but again i dont think that it would be noteworthy security – for your basic payment processing businesses i think its difficult to get paid more for security i mean i think the kind of security product that we get potentially paid additional for would be like a hosted network services or some of the monitoring intrusion prevention services that we offer to our customers our customers had always expected that their payments are processed securely and that i dont think they are willing to pay us anything else for something they already expect to be included if anything i would tell you that we continue to invest significant amounts of money in and around the security area to make sure in fact that we do deliver on that expectation that our customers have so other than the securityrelated products and services that weve offered for some time i dont know that i see a lot of upside in terms of existing businesses based on security considerations timothy wayne willi  wells fargo securities llc great thanks very much thats all i had operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of kartik mehta from northcoast research your line is now open kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc hi good morning kevin and jack hey kevin as you – as i listen in your comments and you talk about the second quarter and based on you saying maybe a couple of pennies pulled into the first quarter would you expect yearoveryear growth or is that going to be difficult considering the tough comparisons you have and kind of what happened in the first quarter kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer i think its going to be tough to have much if any growth kartik i think if i was going to guide you to something id probably guide you to basically flat with last year and then like i said all along with the billing service everything our year is going to be more backendloaded than you all are historically used to so we are anticipating a very sizable fourth quarter so second quarter is not going to be much if any growth obviously if congress puts the re credit in before december  then all bets are off because then that changes the effective tax rate considerably and then obviously we would have growth but thats about the only way i can see that happening kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc and kevin as you look at kind of where the balance sheet is and the amount of free cash you were going to generate this year and where the stock price is do you will you remain aggressive in buying back shares or is this a point in time where you are more comfortable kind of building cash on the balance sheet and waiting for an opportunity either for an acquisition or if something happens in the marketplace taking advantage of buying back stock at that point in time kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer well kartik i dont know about being aggressive weve said for the last couple of quarters that we plan to be more systematic in just buying shares back rather than trying to chase the price so i anticipate that we will continue to be in the market obviously we have a board meeting next week and that will be one of the topics we discuss but i dont see any need and i dont think the board based on previous conversations sees a need for us to build cash on the balance sheet weve got basically a  million revolver thats untapped and with our balance sheet and cash flow if we find an acquisition thats bigger than that we can get financing pretty quickly to satisfy that but i dont really see any need to keep a whole bunch of cash on the balance sheet john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer yeah its like were going to work really hard not to create buying opportunities kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc and then jack just one last question here you talked about the pipeline being really strong and the success youve had on the credit union side are you seeing – if you look at the pipeline and kind of spending trends any changes and how banks or credit unions are spending are you seeing more growth in one area or another john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer thats a good question kartik our sales have been pretty solid across board there is not any one area on previous earnings calls and id say essentially the same thing today that i would call out as being an exceptional area again we are continuing to see growth and momentum in some of the new services like the hosted network services some of the core activity is probably a little slower than what we like to see right now but thats in terms of in the quarter itself but it was offset by sales of other products and i dont necessarily think that observations on a particular quarter represent a trend at this point so its been more of kind of across the board or a number of different areas that nothing i would call out as being particularly unique or different there is a lot of interest in some of our electronic delivery initiatives and the internet banking and mobile and tablet functionality that we are bringing to market a lot interest in seeing what we are doing there but that – again nothing i would point to as being a substantially bigger contributor kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer the one thing i would add that kartik is our trend of existing inhouse customers moving to outsource continues at a very nice pace i think we had  in the first quarter that made that move so that trend continues very nicely for us kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc all right thank you very much i appreciate it kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thanks kartik operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of david koning from robert w baird your line is now open david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah hey guys nice job again yeah and i guess im just wondering if we look back for the last probably   years there has been kind of always a little bit of fear that when the ma environment kind of picks up for banks that it will hurt your spending and the last couple of years now you and fiserv is like you too have pretty high term fees but yet growth is pretty much as good as ever and i mean is this just kind of the thesis again playing out that it really does – consolidation it just doesnt matter that much maybe you can just comment on that a little bit john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer well dave it is certainly a factor that we have all dealt with for the last  or  years and managed as you indicated to continue to find ways to grow the business additional products and services and kind of rounding out our offering that is certainly our expectation it does seem – and i havent done the math to actually check this but it sort of feels like some of the industry consolidation has picked up a little bit here in the last six months or so but again when you look at it on a fullyear basis will that amount to a  shrinkage instead of  shrinkage maybe but again i think its just there are opportunities there we continue to find them and take advantage of those and we think we can continue to grow in the current environment kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yeah and dave as the slides in our investor presentation has shown for many years the vast majority of the consolidation is happening at the low level the lower tier of assetsize bank and credit unions which is not really our playground anyway david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker okay kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer and actually – our target market has actually been pretty stable if not actually growing in some of the larger segments david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah okay thats good and then the inhouse maintenance revenue stream you mentioned there i mean that growth i think was  the strongest in several quarters now is that sustainable or was there anything in there that was a little bit oneoff or is there just a new core replacement cycle with some of the credit unions that just allows that to stay high for a while kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer well i would tell you dave that the majority of that increase in our sales came from the credit union side and that is just because we continue to install a lot of inhouse credit unions on that side of the business john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer yeah as i mentioned david last year we converted six credit unions that were over  billion in assets and so that was throughout the year so you were only seeing partial maintenance from those folks throughout the year so this was – would be the first quarter that would have reflected all six of those for that full period and then again thats just the six that were over  billion we had  credit union sales last year and i think some of those are probably being implemented this year but anyway it has just has been a solid contributor and i dont think there are any unusual onetimes in there that led to that david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thats good and i guess just the last thing the payment segment has been growing kind of highsingle digits for a while i think it was  this quarter i mean its pretty much nothing i mean it hasnt changed much it decelerated just a touch but you are not seeing change really there either right john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer no its – there certainly there has been weve talked about this on previous calls there has been price compression continues to be price compression particularly on renewals its a competitive business and lots of people trying to break into that area so – but no beyond just kind of normal competitive activities that weve seen for a while nothing particularly new david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker okay great thank you john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer thanks dave kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thank you operator and we have the question from the line of david togut from evercore your line is now open rayna kumar  evercore group llc good morning this is rayna kumar for david togut can you go into more detail as to why you anticipate flattish eps growth for the second quarter is it just a tough tax rate comparison or is there more to it thank you kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer well theres two things like i said in the opening comments rayna one in the second quarter last year we had a onetime gain from sale of some products that came through the goldleaf acquisition the tellerware  product which i think that gain was about  million in the quarter and then also the effective tax rate last year was  versus  this year so those combined makes for a pretty tough comparable and a hurdle to get over just to be flat with last year rayna kumar  evercore group llc got it thats really helpful and can you provide us an update on your estimate for fy  capitalized software and internally software and maybe just go over what your largest investments are this year john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer well so the areas that we are investing in and kevin can probably give you better insight on the actual numbers but the areas that we are investing in continue investing in are a number of product – architecture refreshments on the credit union side which weve talked about before weve had a number of improvements that we made on the banking side the larger types of investments in terms of the percentage of those dollars are going more towards paymentsrelated products and mobile and electronic delivery solutions that we offer kevin i dont know if youve got guidance on kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yeah right i mean the internal software – i mean obviously weve got a lot of progress going there as jack mentioned a lot of that is securityrelated and other things we just have to continue to invest in our infrastructure and thats probably going to end up being  million to  million for the year for computer software developed which all of the areas that jack just mentioned payments of mobile and everything else with a lot of these products that are going to be driving future revenue as my quote says certainly in the earnings release the vast majority of our investment is on these additional products the new products and services there are going to be rolled out in the future but thats probably going to be somewhere in the  million to  million for the total year for cap software rayna kumar  evercore group llc got it okay you mentioned pricing compression in your electronic payments business should we think of midsingle digit growth as the new normalized revenue growth for that business john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer right thats probably the right way to think about it rayna kumar  evercore group llc got it could you talk about headtohead win rates for symitar versus fiserv dna in the quarter john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer i dont have that against that specific product we continue to gain market share from a variety of competitive products our win rates are very solid a lot of times when a financial institution bank or credit union goes through an evaluation process they may end up making the decision to stay with their current provider usually after receiving a deep discount to do so but i would tell you that our win rates remain very strong among those financial institutions who go through an evaluation and do decide to make a change from their current vendor and thats going to be anywhere from  to  plus win rate among those who will actually go through with a change from their current provider in terms of breaking it down among which of the  different core solutions we see on the credit union side versus – or for that matter the number that we see on the banking side i dont really track them product versus product rayna kumar  evercore group llc got it could you call out the term fees in the second quarter of  and your expectation for the second quarter of  kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer rayna honestly i dont have that on – with me right now rayna kumar  evercore group llc okay kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer i dont have the companys last year second quarter rayna kumar  evercore group llc okay and just one final question if you can just give us the endofperiod share count kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer  million roughly  million rayna kumar  evercore group llc thank you very much operator and im showing no further question at this time i would like to turn the call back over to kevin williams for closing remarks kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thank you again we want to thank you for

excerpt from the business and application software report the chairman and ceo of jack henry  associates inc jkhy discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industrytwst over the next  to  months whats your agenda for the companymr prim weve got a pretty clear and narrowly focused strategy and it is to continue to execute well in our traditional business and provide those integrated accounting systems for banks and credit unions  which continues to be the heart of our business  and surround those applications with various complementary products that are neededfor example i might sell the accounting system to a bank to handle their deposit and loan general ledger customer accounting but they also need other products like an internet banking system or a mobile banking system or a checkimageprocessing system we have all those complementary products as well primarily the strategy is to sell those integrated accounting systems surrounded with as many of the complementary products as we cananother part of our business the profitstars division is where we sell solutions to address a specific need like a document imaging system or a remote check deposit system that customers can use with whatever accounting system they have it does not have to be a jack henry accounting system for them to use those products even in that area we have some products that we sell to the  or  largest financial institutions to whom we dont normally sell our accounting systems we continue to focus in those areas looking to grow the business were in a very competitive marketplace and a pretty mature industry so every deal is hardfought and we win our share but its always competitivetwst im interested in how the product mix might be changing in the near future with some of the

jack henry  associates under daves leadership with that ill turn it over to kevin for a closer look at the numbers kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thanks jack during the quarter our license revenue represented less than  of our total revenue the vast majority of our license revenue is now included with bundled services and included in the support and services line of revenue our support and services line of revenue continues to drive our total revenue growth and it increased to  million which is an  increase over the same quarter a year ago and represented  of total revenue to break down our support and services for the quarter implementation services of  million versus  million which decreased  which is primarily due to just timing of the efforts and also because of the bundling electronic payments of  million versus  million was up  outlink at  million was up  inhouse maintenance at  million was up  and bundled services was  million up  for the quarter reminder that bundled services contained license implementation services and maintenance revenue related to these multielement contracts related to this revenue id point out that our deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased  million or  compared to last years quarter hardware decreased  for the quarter to  million from  million last year consolidated gross margins improved  for the quarter compared to  last years second quarter support and service margins were steady at  and hardware margins improved  from  our operating expenses increased  for the quarter compared to the year ago which is primarily to the gain in the year ago quarter in our ga for the sale of the teleweb products that were part of the audiotel acquisition we did several years ago our operating margins for the quarter decreased slightly also due to this gain last year thats  compared to  a year ago the effective tax rate for the quarter decreased a little to  from  the second quarter a year ago primarily due to the reinstatement of research and experimentation credit in the fourth quarter or second – march  second fiscal quarter net income was up  to  million from  million which led to eps of  per share which was up  over last year ebitda for the yeartodate increased to  million compared to  million last year or an  increase depreciation and amortization expense was  million with  million in depreciation and  million amortization compared to  million last year included in the total amortization is the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions which was down slightly to  million compared to  million last year as some of those acquired intangibles have now fully amortized operating cash flows were up  million or  to  million for the yeartodate we continue to invest in our company through capex for computer equipment facilities and airplanes which we took possession of our last two airplanes during the fourth quarter so our fleet is now fully upgraded which is a twoyear process and we continue to invest in development and new and existing products to help continue our revenue growth in the future we also continue to return investment to our shareholders through dividends of  million and stock buybacks of  million yeartodate our return on equity for the trailing  months is  and our total shareholder return on stock price appreciation and dividends for the trailing  months ended december  was just over  we purchased  million shares during the quarter and  million shares yeartodate for guidance for the remainder of the year our revenue is still projected to grow in the upper mid single digits for the year similar to the first half to assist you with your modeling the projected effective tax rate for q fy  will be about  down slightly from  last year so not a huge difference and the difference is primarily due to the full year of the rd credit this year compared to only six months spread over last year the tax rate in q is expected to be  giving a fullyear effective tax rate of about  for eps guidance for the third fiscal quarter we are projecting our deconversion fees or early termination fees to be down significantly from last years third quarter with an estimated reduction in these termination fees of a little over  million in the third quarter or about  eps impact therefore based on this it appears the current consensus estimate is  for q its probably a little aggressive probably by a couple of pennies so were probably going to be coming around the  for the third quarter because of this decrease in termination fees and also because we had a couple million this quarter over what we had last year the fourth quarter consensus estimate out there at this time of  appears to be in the ballpark and pretty reasonable that concludes our opening comments and with that we are now ready to take questions chelsea will you please open the call lines up for questions questionandanswer session operator certainly and our first question comes from the line of peter heckmann with avondale your line is now open peter j heckmann  avondale partners llc good morning everyone john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer hi pete peter j heckmann  avondale partners llc kevin just a few housekeeping things so term fees in the fiscal second quarter how did those compare yearoveryear kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer the term fees were up  million compared to the second quarter last year fee peter j heckmann  avondale partners llc you said up  million kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yes peter j heckmann  avondale partners llc okay and then i know the acquired revenue was small but about how much to the base did that contribute in the quarter kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer less than  million peter j heckmann  avondale partners llc okay kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer so our organic revenue growth was still  peter j heckmann  avondale partners llc got it got it okay and then just last question and maybe just a little bit of background for the second quarter in a row were seeing the credit union segment continue to really outperform nicely with very very strong growth but being offset somewhat by a slowdown in the bank side can you talk about some of the gives and takes that account for that dynamic john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer yes pete this is jack there were a couple of things there were a number of larger credit union implementations golives that certainly helped and most of those being from an inhouse standpoint the revenue impact of course under the new revenue recognition guidelines that were operating under so a lot of thats going to show up in the bundled area but basically there were a larger number of larger golives on the credit union side than what we had on the bank side the bank side also was somewhat impacted by one of our larger customers being lost in an acquisition and so there was some revenue impact in the opposite direction on the banking side from that as well kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yes the other thing pete id say is we continue to see really strong growth in both outsourcing and payments on the credit union side peter j heckmann  avondale partners llc great thats helpful thanks kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yep operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of kartik mehta with northcoast research your line is now open kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc hey morning jack can you just talk about maybe the bank spending environment right now if youre seeing any changes either up or down john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer yes kartik its pretty steady different banks are going to be investing in different things some are doing projects in and around the mobile or online banking implementation or a refreshment core systems there certainly continues to be a movement in that area somewhat less aggressively on the banking side than on the credit union side and possibly a little less than what weve seen in some previous years but spending in and around security and related products so there is no one product i would point to that people are rushing to adopt and its going to vary from institution to institution as to what their focus area is kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc and there is not a lot of talk about mobile obviously have you seen any pricing pressure on that or does your model allow you to take advantage of greater clicks that banks are seeing because of use of mobile john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer we havent really seen any recent pressure i would tell you that probably  months ago we were seeing a fair amount of pressure on some of them particularly on some of the mobile offerings as some lowcost options became available out in the market i think weve adjusted accordingly we have an opportunity to provide for the very priceconscious that want a pretty fullyfeatured system but they are more price sensitive weve got a solid offering there with a low price point on it for somebody that wants a little more sophisticated mobile offering we have that option as well and thats going to be priced a little bit higher but as ive said i think  months ago we were seeing more pricing pressure than what were seeing today kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc and then kevin just tax rate going forward is  or  a reasonable tax rate to look at going forward because of the rd tax credit kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer well kartik like i said in my opening comments  is the right rate to use for the third quarter fourth quarter its going to be about  but for fy  its probably going to be somewhere between  and  now that they have made the rd credit permanent kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc perfect thanks i appreciate it kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thanks kartik operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of glenn greene with oppenheimer your line is now open glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you good morning guys kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer hi glenn glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker the first one just going back on the credit union versus the bank growth a couple things so weve had a couple quarters now of credit union growth in sort of this  range and i guess there is a few conversions its been a nice pipeline of conversions that have been happening any reason to think where you dont continue at this sort of like  plus growth for another couple of quarters and then on the bank side if you could directionally quantify how much of a drag there was from that bank loss so that we can kind of have a better idea for sort of core growth ex that bank loss kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer well glenn from the credit union side yes i think we should continue to see very good growth for the next couple of quarters obviously when we get in next fiscal year were going to start hitting some tougher comps so i think were going to continue to see very strong growth in the credit union side at least this fiscal year on the bank side im not sure if i have the numbers right in front of me that tell you what the drag was but it was obviously a couple of percentage points of revenue in the quarter for not just the one bank but for – there was two or three of them that got acquired or due to repricing that had an impact on payments primarily but it also impacted maintenance and other things glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker do you mean two points drag to the banking business or the overall total revenue kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer banking glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker and just to be clear on the – you sort of gave the q and the q eps expectations including what weve got yeartodate youre kind of suggesting mids for the year just to be clear kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yes i think thats where were going to windup glenn i mean were  yeartodate i think third quarter is going to be in the ish each range and right now im pretty comfortable with that consensus estimate of  out there in the fourth quarter i think that gets you to about  or something like that glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker and the outsourcing if i heard it right it sounded like it decelerated to  is that for the same reasons that some of those – the bank losses or pricing or kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer no actually glenn the outsourcing – if you net out the deconversion fees on outsourcing it was actually more like a  growth yearoveryear so its pretty much in line with where it has been the real pressure came in the payments line if you net out the deconversion fees on the payments line the payments was only about  growth if you net that out thats where the real tough growover is from the drag from some of the repricing and loss of customers glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker and then the share buyback youve been pretty consistent i guess at  million shares or so a quarter any reason to think youd change that or perhaps get more aggressive kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer i dont know that well get any more aggressive at this point glenn and obviously thats driven by the board and we have our quarterly board meeting next week so that will be a discussion at the board meeting just like it is every quarter and well decide where we go but youre right i mean we said going into this year that we were going to be a little more aggressive we bought  million shares yeartodate which is about the guidance i gave at the front that we were going to buy for the year so will we buy some more probably but i dont know that well keep the same pace that we have in the first half glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay great thanks a lot kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thanks glenn operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of brett huff with stephens inc your line is now open brett huff  stephens inc good morning jack kevin and hello dave john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer good morning brett huff  stephens inc quick question on the pipeline jack you talked a little bit about that as you look forward and this is kind of i guess tied to a sub question of longterm growth outlook you guys have been kind of peer leading among your peers for a while on growth and kevin you just commented at least for this year that the credit union pipeline looks really good can you give us a sense of what are the components of the pipeline that you guys look at most earnestly and how does that translate into how you think about longterm growth i guess combined bank and credit union business over the next few years john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer brett i tend to focus more on the total backlog at this point with license fees representing zero percent of our total revenue support and services being  hardware on a steady decline so i tend to just focus more on total backlog which by and large anymore is almost support and services but yes so on the heels of a strong sales quarter as i mentioned all three brands were over  i think the lowest performance was  or  from one of the three brands in spite of that pipelines remained flattish even with closing that volume of business so im not sure if i actually got to the point that you were looking to get to kevin if you would add anything to that kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yeah the other thing id add brett is one of the things that we obviously continue to focus on is the in to out movement because obviously thats a very good thing for our business long term and currently were right at the  of our existing core customer base that are now outsourced so we still got a long road ahead of us to continue those conversions through the first half were right on track to do basically what we did in the previous year so i think we did  in the first half we did  last year so were right on track to continue that same path so thats something that i really watch and then also we continue to look at the payments business and the opportunities we have there not only just in bill pay but also in passport and pps and all of the different payments groups remote deposit cash where we still got a pretty good runway there so those are the sort of things that i kind of look at to look at the future because obviously as jack said those are big drivers those are all important services and thats whats going to drive us going forward brett huff  stephens inc okay any update on the – i cant remember the name of the product but where youre helping folks outsource more of their – even their front office it systems kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer hosted network services brett huff  stephens inc yeah thank you any update on that and you didnt mention that as one of kind of the major growers but is that still something that could be a part of that growth system kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer i would tell you its growing nicely brett i mean as weve said originally this is one thats going to be slow growing things because its a complicated sale its a big decision for an fi to make to give us all of their servers but it is growing its actually ahead of plan and growing very nicely and is it contributing yes is it a huge contributor at this point no but its like i said ahead of track brett huff  stephens inc okay john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer i will just add to that brett were continuing to have increased golives very good success from the institutions that have implemented it so the reference base is building out there as to the advantage of this approach and the average contract values that were seeing continue to increase so a lot of good trends happening there its just again the percentage growth is very solid but in terms of being to a point where it makes a meaningful impact from a revenue standpoint not really there yet but again with the security environment and the talent acquisition and retention environment particularly for technically oriented talent that were all seeing right now again we believe that this is a very solid solution thats going to be a nice longterm contributor brett huff  stephens inc and then last question just thinking about margins over the medium term as well you guys have had good margin performance and nice gross margins this quarter you guys already have very high margins kind of where do we go from here and where do the levers if there are any that we should be paying attention to kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer well brett i mean can some  opportunity for additional expansion come  i mean its going to come from the continued growth in our outsourcing and payments groups i mean thats going to be the drivers because those are the highest margin business and well continue to leverage the existing infrastructure but having said that as jack pointed out security and compliance and other things are big issues so i dont know if theres going to be the same margin expansion that weve seen in the past but i think theres still some opportunity and i think going forward that well continue to see some opportunity for operating margin expansion on the ga line and possibly selling and marketing it wont come from the rd line because we have to continue to reinvest in our product as we continue to grow and move upstream into the larger fis brett huff  stephens inc great thats what i needed thanks guys kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of dave koning with robert w baird your line is now open david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah hey guys nice job kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer thanks dave david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah i guess just a couple really the termination fees i know you said would be down yearoveryear in q which makes sense is that mostly in payments or in outsourcing or a mix kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer its a mix its across the board dave david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker okay i just wanted to make sure we kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer last year in the third quarter we had right at  million in termination fees and this year we think thats going to be about – under  million david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker okay but if we just take a few out yearoveryear from each like if its down   kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yeah david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker okay okay and then the other one hardware you maybe mentioned this a little earlier too but hardware was down  yearoveryear i know its immaterial now is it like accelerating its declines or should we just expect kind of  to  declines for a long time kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer i think you can just expect that dave i mean the deal with hardware is its hard for us to predict because thats driven by ibm and other hardware providers and when they come out with new upgrades and what theyre going to force the customers to have and as we continue to move customers from ins to outs theyre not going to be buying hardware upgrades so its just going to be a continual decrease in hardware now the hardware margins should stay really solid because the nonhardware parts of that hardware line of revenue which is our higher margin business like our jhadirect and the  different things thats going to continue to become a larger percentage of that line which will help maintain the margins in the hardware line of revenue david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker okay good and then lastly just like do the small banks ever ask you about blockchain i mean quite honestly i dont really even understand it very much at all but is this more of a bigger bank thing that that theyre looking at it or do the small banks every once in a while kind of ask you about it or i mean is it just a nonissue john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer thats a great question dave and i would say that today small banks are not really asking about it i fully expect that they will be simply because there is so much noise in the media about it weve got a number of folks that are looking at it and looking at potential applications which sounds like thats what the whole world is doing right now is trying to figure out where if anywhere the blockchain technology might fit its first line of thought tends to be in and around the payments area because of its original affiliation with bitcoin its possible certainly some types of payments they talk about an average potential transaction time settlement time of around seven minutes well you know thats pretty quick if youre talking about something like a crossborder money transfer or a businesstobusiness payment relative to payment options that are out there today relative to an atm transaction relative to a debit card transaction at target seven minutes is probably going to be a little long for that to be the best application and then there is the whole potential other areas of nonpayment oriented transactions like land deed transactions smart contracts and other things so there is an awful lot of people trying to figure out where if anywhere this might fit and i would include us in that category at this point but were not getting frankly questions from any of our customers at this point but i fully expect that given how much discussion continues to take place around the technology that that will change and they will want to know more about what it means once they come to understand it a little bit better david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah okay well thats great thank you john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer thanks dave operator our next question comes from the line of glenn greene with oppenheimer your line is now open glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks just a couple followups and that was probably one of the best blockchain answers i have heard in a while jack you sort of alluded to that each of your segments was sort of i think trending ahead of quota yeartodate in terms of sales and bookings could you sort of directionally kind of give us some sense what your sales growth looks like yeartodate across the segments john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer i dont know that i know it on a yeartodate basis i think there is three brands and i think i have said the lowest was about  of quota one was  of quota and i think the third one was somewhere in between those two ish so it was a strong sales quota now i will tell you that first quarter two of them were at plan one was well behind the overall average was right about  so were right around  for the first quarter strong fiscal second quarter and expectation would be  to  yearoveryear kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yeah the numbers jack has given you glenn are percentage of quota and id tell you that quota for all three brands went up so its a kind of – i dont know that any of us in this room actually calculate that but i would guesstimate that its probably   growth over last year in total bookings glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker yeartodate okay john f prim  chairman  chief executive officer yeah glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker and then kevin this is a question for you on your favorite topic the bundled services but the question really is when does the bundled service accounting turn to a revenue and profit tailwind meaning i was under the impression that this was sort of a neutral impact and perhaps fiscal  you actually get a benefit from the accounting as you recognize some of that deferred revenue faster than you refill the deferred revenue funnel kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer well one of the things i will tell you glenn and i made sure to point that out in my opening comments our deferred revenue went up  this year over last year which is kind of unusual and my point there is because of the new referrals we are actually continuing to defer faster than we are recognizing revenues actually through the bundling so we are continuing to defer a lot of revenue could there be some tailwinds come out of that in  as we do some things yeah and i will tell you glenn with the new referrals coming out and they keep changing the date its either  or  now we are going to have to do some things to try to rampup those contracts get the revenue out and the timing of that – some of that is not up to us some of that is up to the customers when theyll actually either accept the products or whatever so could there be some tailwinds in  yeah but right now were still deferring faster than were recognizing glenn greene  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay great thanks kevin d williams  chief financial officer and treasurer yep operator thank you and im not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to mr kevin williams for closing
