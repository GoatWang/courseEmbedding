analytics taking the first step modernizing your analytics environment gms randy mott what i believecios five core principles underpin automakers threeyear it transformation planduring randy motts plus years in it he has developed some core beliefs rely on inhouse people rather than outsourcers get data to the right people to help them make moreinformed decisions deliver projects faster than before streamline and automate it operations to free up more money for innovative work now mott is applying that belief system to general motors under a threeyear it transformation plan during one of the most tumultuous times in the companys year history he joined gm as cio in february  when the automaker was emerging from a controversial government bailout and takeover and now much of the publics attention is turning to gms handling of a defective ignition switch on earliermodel chevy cobalts and other models that is linked to driver deaths against that backdrop mott and team are a little over a year into the it overhaul plan one of whose goals is to improve data sharing and analysis to help gm identify engineering and manufacturing problems earlier in the process underpinning that broad plan are motts five core principles  as he has expressed them in recent presentations under the heading what i believe  which i lay out below adding a bit of my own analysis on how they relate to the modern world  real innovation happens with it professionals tightly aligned to company strategy weve all been hearing this refrain for decades in fact itbusiness alignment is almost always the no  challenge cited by respondents to the annual society for information management survey youd think such alignment would have happened by now sure cios and other it leaders must be on the same page with every business unit whether its sales marketing finance hr or manufacturing but itbusiness alignment isnt a oneway street mott talked about a refined senior executive structure at gm that  not necessarily by design  is starting to align the companys business leaders with motts it goals one of which is to eliminate the sprawl of applications and data while moving to global software platforms for instance theres now a single head of global manufacturing timothy e lee as mott looks to standardize gm units on global manufacturing systems theres now a single head of global quality and customer experience alicia bolerdavis as mott looks to consolidate gms quality customer and other data into a single global data warehouse learn more about how analytics and data management are core to gms it transformation see gms data strategy pushed to center stage so its not just about it aligning with the business the business has moved toward us he told informationweek in a recent interview at gms detroit headquarters  real business applications on an enterprise scale do not come from venture capitalists the all caps emphasis is motts not mine this may be the most contentious point in motts belief system its trendy these days for companies in a range of industries capital one ge ford walmart to set up a digital innovation shoplabcenter in silicon valley and for their cioschief digital officers to meet with venture capitalists and startups to tap into the latest thinking but when mott was identifying locations last year for four technical innovation centers gm wanted to set up across the country he stayed away from the valley and other vc hotbeds instead he opted for suburban detroit atlanta phoenix and austin mainly for their proximity to current gm operations andor affordable tech talent including a dozen or so universities mott isnt arguing that vcbacked startups produce no meaningful enterprise it innovations but hes skeptical that their systems and applications can scale affordably to meet fortune  needs as motts team started last year to pull billions of dollars of it operations and development inhouse from four or five outsourcers the automaker signed longterm fiveyear enterprise license agreements with  blue chip vendors adobe ca cisco emc hewlettpackard ibm mcafee microsoft oracle sap and vmware mott values not only the proven scalability of those vendors products but also their global footprint and product line breadth he also values systems and applications that can be customized and integrated with others one reason hes not a big fan of cloud services embracing cloud software and infrastructure is a strategy of how do i get even not how do i get ahead mott says and i think the companies that win in their industries are the ones that figure out how to get ahead because getting competitive advantage takes innovation it takes creativity and youre not going to get that from someone whos going to make everyone on the planet even  modern innovative companies have a good mix of experienced it professionals and college hires who are forwardthinking and less resistant to change as gm moves from doing  of its it work inhouse as of january  to doing  of it inhouse by the end of  its hiring thousands of people while taking billions of dollars of work back from outsourcers as part of that effort gms it organization will have brought on  new people by the end of this year  of them recent college grads long term by about  gm will have about  it employees mott estimates mott and team are hiring for a mix of skills including sap siebel and even peoplesoft development and integration java and net development especially for sales marketing and dealer apps and oracle and microsoft sql server databases the overall focus do much less run the business it work whether by staffers or the outsourcers that remain and more new next page rob preston currently serves as vp and editor in chief of informationweek where he

it might collapse i got a strange feeling he is building a typical it company across gm forgeting hes a cio of the automotive coorporation with business spread across the globe people insourced on new positions are not having any experience in automotive industry at all nor the experience with other regions outside of the us this is leading to much stronger separation between gm business and gm it and at the end it might destroy all relations that have been already built between it and business this is a point where randy and his exhp and exdell guys forgot that business owns the company not it business rates it as well somebody mentioned about shadow it according to me shadow it was an answer on a weak performance of an it organization in general if business couldnt get from it what they want they are going to suppliers leaving gm it and all is done working without issues without tons of documents processes analysis i think randys organization will be hit again with shadow it when the business will get angry about delayed projects nonworking apps forced centralized apps with a limited business engagement lead by typical it pms with no idea about markets and business needs that will be the first step the system is failing additionally when those projects or apps will have errors and for another year it will be fixing it up the level of business aggression which is quite high today will reach the top and the transformation will be over i think the general idea of randys strategy is worth trying but not in the automotive industry but hes doing too many things in one time in huge organization where the intertia between top and bottom might be even  year i can belive he was an expert  years ago knowing the walmart business across us but i doubt if hes experienced automotive person across all the globe with multicontinental automotive regulations cars are not the same as a popcorn and i think hes treating this business this way hp is still returning to the model before transformation have no idea about dell but i keep the fingers crossed im giving personally  year  big success or failed transformation with huge mess rd time in a row  reply    post

they think about the insourcing   gm it has become bad to worse to impossible is what they will say   gms neighbours ford chrysler etc  all of them had insourced for many years what happened there

did a lot of innovative stuff all inhouse  the environment was friendly fun and we got things done  by the way heres a news flash to anyone who says cobol is dead walmart was programmed  in cobol  randy knows the it business and i dare say he is as innovative and daring in his thinking for enterprise computing as steve jobs was for micro computing  gm is lucky to have him reply    post message

helped make citicorp the global leader under his watch this is also a great model for other companies who are having problems reigning in it to follow for most companies itbusiness alignment is doublespeak which means sure well create a new division whose job is to work closely with you while we continue working on whats really important the business divisions dont need a feel good team that delivers hot air while shadow it divisions continue to proliferate but better access to the resources already there it internal alignment is a step in the right direction many companies which create innovation centers in these trendy locations fail to realize that many of the best ideas which will help the company long term will come from the workers who already understand the environment what the problems are and whats needed what they usually lack is access to the right people to present these ideas building innovation centers close to staff is a step in the right direction and a great morale booster integrating new with existing talent rather than replacing one with the other helps this process along the new thinkers can help existing staff formulate and better articulate their ideas the ability to deliver faster is what the automakers need if mott can deliver them gm has a good chance of making it to top reply    post message    messages list    start a board login anon

the value to be had from cloud software im looking forward to the on stage discussion with informationweek conference attendees this week to hear what kind of questions cio peers ask reply    post

strategy  too many times you have it running for its sake and ignorant of the true business needs of the organization  if it wants to have any relevance they have to move beyond basic plumbing support and maintenance reply    post message    messages list    start a board login anon user rank apprentice   am gms cio if you are cio of a gm you can afford to speak whatever you want however this looks like classic cio speak who is disconnected with the ground realities and how the technology world is changing though some of the bets he is taking will be good overall gm is going to lose gm needs to smell coffee and leverage digital transformation across its business processes to leap ahead of its competition he makes valid point that enterprise software are not best served by the vcfunded companies however gm should look to acquire such small companies and create inhouse solutions that help in excel reply    post message    messages list    start a board login charlie babcock user rank author   pm mott misconstrues cloud services when mott says using cloud infrastructure and software as a service is a way to get even not get ahead he misconceives of whats going on out there i agree it is a good idea to keep core it skills in house but they can be put to work effectively on cloud infrastructure and customizing saas if thats what the cio wants hes thinking too much inhouse resources are better than external ones you dont have to be an advocate of outsourcing to make good use of the cloud on the contrary the cloud gives the internal managers control over the resource and allows them to use it as an extension of the data center to misconceive this could be damaging to your long term prospects reply    post message    messages list    start a board login majenkins user rank ninja   pm re will the trend toward inhouse it stick at gm i think it will stick as long as mott is there when he leaves not if when then all bets are off i was very glad to see someone in a position of authority say what i have been saying for years pundits and cios always talk about it aligning with the business goals but never put any onus on the business to align with the it goals and philosophies that is why you have so much money wasted on what you called shadow it things that get one thing done for one part of the business but don�t achieve any larger or longer term goals reply

november    bankrupt and in need of a bailout gm appeared headed for the wrecking yard in  fast forward and ceo dan akerson’s transformation program has the iconic automaker back in the black in a cruxialcio exclusive cio randy mott explains how he reengineered gm’s it unit to support the turnaround situation solutions takeaways change agent cm cio randy mott is driving innovation that’s

management solution mobility in the manufacturing workplace  musthave mobile application qualities to increase operational efficiency general motors emerged from a prepackaged government backed chapter  bankruptcy in mid as “the new gm” or more precisely ngmco inc prior to that the automaker suffered through years of losses that brought it to the point of extinctionto prevent a repeat ceo dan ackerson who took the helm in august  knows that the new gm can’t look much like its prebankruptcy self it needs to be nimble streamlined and globally integrated while producing reliable fuel efficient cars that can meet and beat foreign competitorsespecially in fastgrowing emerging marketsthe strategy looks good on paper but meaningless unless akerson and his team can execute enter senior vp and cio randy mott who joined the automaker in february  after leading it departments at global giants such as hewlettpackard dell and walmartmott’s mission drive an it transformation that aligns with and supports gm’s business revamp “to drive the overall business transformation we needed to build an it organization that could support and enable rapid innovation” said mott in an exclusive interview with cruxialciomott’s first priority on coming aboard was to turn gm’s it department from one that depended mostly on outsourcing contractors for key projects to one that got things done inhouse mott’s predecessor ralph szygenda was a big believer in outsourcing and relied heavily on vendors like electronic data systems now part of hewlettpackard att cap gemini accenture and wipro technologiesszygenda insisted that his “dream team” operate globally and use standardsbased approaches to it service delivery their playbooks had to include itil cmm six sigma and other standards to ensure that for instance both eds’ and accenture’s approach to provisioning were compatiblebut mott says that doesn’t go far enough for a company that needs to rapidly innovate “part of the premise for innovation and application change is that you implement projects and implementing projects into an outsourced environment is by definition hard costly and slow”so shortly after his arrival mott cut ties with the bulk of gm’s contractors and began the process of bringing projects back to michigan in the process the company’s it staff expanded from  to more than  workers gm is also investing  million in a new technology infrastructuregm’s transformation also includes an effort to collect and make better use of the vast amount of data that it collects from its operations it’s building an enterprise data warehouse to centralize and standardize information gathered from company operations across the globe it’s harvesting data from the manufacturing floor to support a quality initiative led by senior vp alicia bolerdavis and it’s culling bits and bytes that come in through customerfacing services like onstar “every piece of transactional data gives us an opportunity to improve” says mottpostbailout gm needs to be lean mean and efficient that applies to its it unit among the efficiency projects that mott is pursuing is data center consolidation the company is trimming its it real estate footprint from  datacenters to just two there’s the recently opened  squarefoot facility in warren mich and a new datacenter that will come online next year at its vehicle proving ground in milford michmott also wants to drive efficiency into his it department by automating routine processes such as provisioning and network monitoring that will save the company money and also frees up staff to work on projects that drive business value for general motors prior to his arrival mott says about  of gm’s it personnel whether company employees or outsourced contractors were engaged in routine keeptheserversup type of work while only  were engaged in truly innovative projects mott wants to flip that to the point where  are driving innovation “we need to change the mix” says mott corporate renaissance like the old gm the new gm remains headquartered in downtown detroit gm case studies columbia sportswear benefiting through cloud hb fuller upgrading hr systems white papers the consumer it revolution cloud first not just transformation but innovation mott’s vision for a more efficient streamlined and innovative it organization for gm sounded good in theory but he had to execute that required careful planning lots of backup plans and flawless execution “we’ve got a  billion business we don’t want to interrupt” says mottinsourcing gm’s insourcing initiative involved eliminating roughly  vendor contracts and moving the work inhouse—everything from mainframe operations and application development to network management mott says the transition was eased by the fact that he automated some of the work rather than hand it off to new inhouse teams “when you do that you take a lot of the work out of the process it’s move and automate”recruitment gm’s insourcing initiative resulted in the company’s internal it workforce expanding from  tech pros to more than  in an era when even tech giants like microsoft complain that it’s hard to find individuals with the skills they need gm required a strategy for recruiting and retention one tactic the company used was to go to where the talent is the automaker’s four innovation centersone is colocated at the warren data center the others are in roswell georgia austin texas and chandler arizonaput it within a  mile radius of  of the available talent in the us according to mott “we tried to go where they are” says mott “the new gm has also earned a reputation for our product design and engineering and winning in the marketplace that’s also appealing to candidates”gm also hired a number of employees that previously worked for its contractors including  from hpconsolidation gm is moving from  data centers to just two in warren and milford michigan such moves can be fraught with risk data can be lost key applications can become unavailable and network systems can be disrupted “the key is that if we have any kind of problem we just don’t go” says mott “we protect the business that way” among other things gm moved applications that had been running on an outsourced mainframe at a hewlettpackard facility in plano texas to a new mainframe at warren “we did it over two weekends we did dry runs and dress rehearsals as this touched factories all over the world”big data and analytics gm’s it transformation includes building a platform that allows the company to glean business insights—at a granular level—from incoming data from factory floors and customerfacing apps and services mott says choosing the right technology is key at the heart of gm’s big data platform is hadoop a flexible opensource architecture that ropes together hundreds of industrystandard servers to form a big data hive gm previously ran  data marts by year’s end it will have moved  of those into the new architecture “we can now invest very high volumes of data into the new data platform” says mottgm’s growing enterprise data warehouse also relies on ibm infosphere biginsights for building hadoop applications and reporting and analytics tools from teradataprivate clouds gm’s new it infrastructure makes use of cloud principles like virtualization shared services load balancing and standardization it all makes for a more efficient cost effective environment mott however is not about to put any of gm’s applications in public or vendorrun clouds “a lot of people who are promoting these off premises clouds are really promoting outsourcing by a different name and i think it will have all the same problems in terms of how do you stay current how do you add to it and how do you remain responsive to the business” says mott “i’m not looking to go back”  it believer like his cio randy mott gm ceo dan akerson thinks key tech systems belong in house reuters case studies d

challenges as momentum moves from developed economies to emerging markets gm cio randy mott is not overhauling the company’s global tech footprint just for the sake of change the it transformation parallels an overall business transformation that ceo dan akerson has been driving since he was named to the top job in akerson wants to make gm a nimble efficient innovative company with a consistent worldwide footprint by  he wants  of gm’s auto manufacturing on global platforms and of course he wants the automaker to be consistently profitable there’s little chance as in zero that the company would get another bailout from the federal governmentmott’s role is to create an it environment that supports and enables akerson’s goals “we needed a different mix in terms of how much innovation we do and how do we grow our business you take that with all the other gm initiatives going on from a business standpoint and that was the mission starting two years ago and we’re still executing on it today”akerson himself is a big believer in gm owning its own tech infrastructure “you have to own it and you have to control it and when you don’t you’re at the whim of other companies and their priorities and if they have financial problems their difficulties” the ceo said earlier this year at a press conference to open the warren tech centerone example of how gm’s it unit is supporting company goals is a new service that helps the automaker and its customers connect more easily salespeople and even consumers can walk the lot at gm dealers and use a mobile app for the apple ipad or smartphones that provides deepdive information on the vehicle the user is looking at “it offers a richer experience for the customer and helps them with what may be a large purchasing decision in their lives” says mottthere’s evidence that gm’s transformation including the it part is starting to pay off the company’s stock price has increased from a  on july  of last year to  on nov  of last week a gain of and the company is profitable it posted net income of  billion in the third quarter on  billion in net revenues up from  billion in the prior year quarterbut gm and mott aren’t satisfied next year the cio plans to push even harder on the innovation front the business value created from new projects undertaken will be three times that of what his group delivered this year “that’s the headline for ” says mott “we want shorter projects and we want to deliver more projects with higher business value more quickly”gm ceo akerson touts company’s turnaroundtheoretical
