defined below under section a of the investment company act of  the company act if the purchasing shareholders sell securities to one or more investment portfolios portfolios of the ge institutional funds the fund in exchange for shares of the portfolios background you state that the fund is registered with the commission as an openend management investment company and is designed primarily for institutional investors you state that the fund currently has nine portfolios and offers two classes of shares i the investment class and ii the service class you state that the ge funds also is registered with the commission as an openend management investment company you state that both the ge funds and the fund share the same board of trustees board and the same investment adviser ge asset management incorporated geam a direct wholly owned subsidiary of general electric company a publicly held holding company you state that each of seven of the ge funds series the redeeming funds correspond to a particular portfolio of the fund in that each redeeming fund has the same investment objectives investment strategies and investment portfolio managers as the corresponding portfolio you also represent that each redeeming fund and corresponding portfolio have substantially identical portfolio holdings unlike the fund the redeeming funds are designed primarily for retail and smaller institutional investors that do not meet the requirements for investing in the corresponding portfolios you state that certain retirement plans and trusts sponsored and maintained by the general electric company and its affiliates hold shares of the redeeming funds and are now eligible to invest in the portfolios because the fund recently changed its eligibility requirements for persons that may invest in the portfolios you state that those investors the purchasing shareholders are expected to choose to invest in the portfolios because of the lower expense ratios the absence of sales charges for purchasing the funds shares  and the substantially identical investment objectives and policies of the redeeming funds the redeeming funds and the fund propose to facilitate those investments by allowing the purchasing shareholders to redeem their shares of the redeeming funds inkind and to use the redemption proceeds to acquire investment class shares of the corresponding portfolios the proposed inkind purchases in particular the purchasing shareholders would use the redemption proceeds as consideration for the purchase of the corresponding portfolios shares the inkind consideration you represent that the inkind redemptions and the proposed inkind purchases would be effected simultaneously you also represent that for purposes of determining the amount of portfolio shares to sell to the purchasing shareholders the value ascribed to the inkind consideration by the portfolio would be the same as the value that the redeeming funds would ascribe to the inkind consideration for purposes of determining the amount of redemption proceeds to pay a redeeming shareholder you claim that the proposed inkind purchases would benefit a redeeming fund by allowing it to avoid significant brokerage costs that would be incurred if it had to sell its portfolio securities to realize cash to pay redemption proceeds to the purchasing shareholders you claim that similarly the portfolios would avoid significant brokerage costs that would be incurred if the portfolios had to buy portfolio securities with the cash that would be invested in the portfolios by the purchasing shareholders in addition you note that the portfolios would likely buy the same securities as would have been paid out in the inkind redemption you represent that each portfolio will effect the proposed inkind purchases in a manner consistent with the following the proposed procedures  an inkind purchase will not dilute the interests of the shareholders of the portfolio  the inkind consideration accepted by a portfolio will consist of securities that are appropriate in type and amount for investment by the portfolio in light of its investment objectives and policies and current holdings  a purchasing shareholders inkind consideration will consist only of the entire redemption proceeds obtained through the redemption of shares of the corresponding redeeming fund  a redeeming fund and corresponding portfolio will have the same procedures for determining their net asset values and will follow those procedures in determining the amount of redemption proceeds to be paid to the purchasing shareholder upon redemption from the redeeming fund and the amount of portfolio shares to sell to a purchasing shareholder respectively a redeeming fund and corresponding portfolio will ascribe the same value to the inkind consideration  the redemption inkind and the purchase inkind will be effected simultaneously  the portfolio will effect the purchase inkind pursuant to procedures adopted by the board including a majority of those trustees who are not interested persons of the fund within the meaning of section a of the company act independent trustees that are reasonably designed to provide that the purchases inkind are effected in a manner consistent with  through  above  the board including a majority of independent trustees will determine no less frequently than quarterly that all inkind purchases made by purchasing shareholders during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with these procedures did not favor the purchasing shareholders to the detriment of any other shareholder of the portfolio and were in the best interests of the portfolio  the fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which the purchase occurred the first two years in an easily accessible place a copy of its inkind purchase procedures as well as other records for the purchase inkind setting forth the identity of the purchasing shareholder a description of the composition of the relevant portfolios investment portfolio including each assets value immediately prior to the purchase inkind a description of each security delivered in connection with the purchase inkind the terms of the inkind purchase the information or materials upon which the asset valuations were made and a description of the composition of the relevant portfolios investment portfolio including each assets value one month after the inkind purchase  geam will consistent with its fiduciary duties disclose to the independent trustees the existence of and all of the material facts relating to any conflicts of interest between geam and the portfolios in a proposed inkind purchase to allow the independent trustees to approve the inkind purchase you assert that effecting the proposed inkind purchases in accordance with the proposed procedures would be fair to shareholders consistent with the general purposes of the company act consistent with the investment policies of the portfolios and beneficial to the portfolios redeeming funds and their shareholders accordingly you seek guidance concerning the application of section a of the company act to the proposed inkind purchases legal analysis section a of the company act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company firsttier affiliate or any affiliated person of such person secondtier affiliate acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to the investment company section a was designed to prevent selfdealing and other forms of overreaching of a registered investment company by its affiliates in particular the section protects investors by prohibiting a purchase or sale transaction when a party to the transaction has both the ability and the pecuniary incentive to influence the actions of the investment company section a may be interpreted to prohibit the proposed inkind purchases because a purchasing shareholder may be considered to be a secondtier affiliate of a portfolio and the purchase would entail the sale of the inkind consideration ie securities to the portfolio in exchange for investment class shares a purchase inkind transaction may raise certain concerns underlying section a of the company act because an affiliate may use its influence to cause the registered investment company to accept unwanted portfolio securities in addition an affiliate may use its influence to cause the registered investment company to issue its shares to the affiliate in exchange for consideration ie securities that is of lesser value than the shares issued you contend that by conducting the proposed inkind purchases consistent with the proposed procedures the purchases would not raise the concerns underlying the prohibitions of section a of the company act you also contend that the proposed procedures while not identical to are consistent with conditions imposed by the commission in exemptive relief for inkind purchase transactions that are similar to the proposed inkind purchases in particular you assert that no affiliated person of a portfolio would cause the portfolio to accept unwanted portfolio securities you assert that pursuant to the proposed procedures the inkind consideration would be consistent in type and amount with each portfolios investment objectives and policies and current holdings you note that the inkind consideration would consist of the inkind proceeds from the redemption of shares of the corresponding redeeming fund which has the same investment objectives and policies is managed in the same manner and has substantially identical portfolio holdings as the corresponding portfolio you also note that pursuant to the proposed procedures the board will review the inkind purchases on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that among other things no portfolio accepted unwanted portfolio securities you assert further that neither the purchasing shareholders nor any other affiliated person of a portfolio would cause the portfolio to issue its shares in exchange for inkind consideration that was of lesser value than the shares because of the protections provided by the proposed procedures those procedures focus on the proper and consistent valuation of the inkind consideration by the portfolio and redeeming fund and require a determination by the board that the inkind purchases did not favor the purchasing shareholders to the detriment of any other shareholder in addition the proposed procedures require a portfolio to make and keep records relating to the inkind purchases that would facilitate later review as appropriate of the inkind purchases on the basis of the facts and representations set forth in your letter we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission against the purchasing shareholders under section a of the company act if the purchasing shareholders sell securities to one or more portfolios as part of an inkind investment in the portfolios because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter you should note that any different facts or representations may require a different conclusion kenneth c fang senior counsel incoming letter december   by hand douglas j scheidt associate director and chief counsel us securities and exchange commission division of investment management  f street ne washington dc  re ge institutional funds no action letter request dear mr scheidt we are writing on behalf of ge institutional funds the fund an openend management investment company registered under the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act we are seeking the concurrence of the staff of the division of investment management that it will agree not to recommend enforcement action to the securities and exchange commission commission under section a of the investment company act if the fund acting on behalf of one or more of its investment portfolios portfolios were to accept investments inkind from certain affiliated investors in the manner described below without first obtaining an exemptive order pursuant to section b of the investment company act i background the fund a delaware statutory trust is designed primarily for institutional investors such as corporations foundations endowments and trusts that manage various types of employee benefit plans as well as charitable religious and educational institutions the fund currently consists of nine portfolios including the international equity fund us equity fund strategic investment fund smallcap value equity fund premier growth equity fund value equity fund and income fund shares of the portfolios are currently offered in two classes the investment class class i and service class purchasers of class i shares do not pay any sales charges including frontend contingent deferred or assetbased sales charges or shareholder service and distribution fees in connection with their investments in the portfolios ge funds a massachusetts business trust is registered as an openend management investment company under the investment company act it is designed primarily for retail and smaller institutional investors that generally do not meet the requirements for investing in the fund ge funds currently consists of  series including ge international equity fund ge us equity fund ge strategic investment fund ge smallcap value equity fund ge premier growth equity fund ge value equity fund and ge fixed income fund collectively the redeeming funds the redeeming funds generally offer four classes of shares a b c and y class y shares are held by various institutional investors including certain retirement plans and trusts sponsored and maintained by general electric company ge a publicly held holding company and its affiliates the geaffiliated investors the redeeming funds and the corresponding portfolios have the same investment objectives investment strategies portfolio managers and therefore substantially identical portfolio holdings ge asset management incorporated geam an investment adviser registered under the investment advisers act of  as amended serves as investment adviser to both the fund and the ge funds geam provides investment management services to numerous registered investment companies other us and non uscollective investment vehicles including group trusts partnerships and separate managed accounts offered to us and nonus pension and corporate accounts geam is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ge the same persons serve as members of the board of trustees of the fund and ge funds the board a proposed investment inkind transactions the fund recently changed its eligibility requirements for persons that may invest in the various portfolios as a result certain geaffiliated investors that hold class y shares of the redeeming funds are now eligible to invest in the portfolios these investors the redeeming shareholders are expected to choose to invest in the portfolios because of the lower expense ratios of the portfolios the absence of sales charges for purchasing shares of the portfolios and the substantial identity in investment objectives and policies between the redeeming funds and corresponding portfolios to facilitate the expected investments by redeeming shareholders in the portfolios the fund and the ge funds propose to permit inkind redemption and purchase transactions where possible under this proposal the redeeming shareholders would be allowed to redeem their shares of the redeeming funds inkind and use the proceeds to acquire class i shares of corresponding portfolios in transactions occurring simultaneously this approach would benefit redeeming shareholders as well as remaining shareholders of the redeeming funds and the portfolios the affected funds because they would avoid the significant brokerage costs that would be incurred if portfolio securities of the redeeming funds were sold to realize cash to pay redemption proceeds of the redeeming shareholders and the redemption proceeds were then used to acquire similar portfolio securities when invested in corresponding portfolios in addition because investors in class i shares do not pay any frontend contingent deferred or assetbased sales charges nor any service fees in connection with investing in the portfolios the redeeming shareholders would not incur any sales charges or service fees in connection with investing in the portfolios we anticipate that a majority of the inkind purchases would occur during the quarter immediately following the first date that the redeeming shareholders are eligible to invest in the portfolios we expect there will be instances however in which redeeming shareholders will choose to engage in the proposed inkind purchases after this initial period the ge funds would effect the proposed redemption inkind transaction in reliance on the noaction relief granted by the staff in signature financial group inc pub avail dec   the signature letter consequently we are not requesting relief in this letter for the redemption inkind transaction because the redeeming shareholders may be considered affiliated persons of affiliated persons of the portfolios as that term is defined in section a of the investment company act an inkind purchase of the type contemplated would be subject to the prohibitions on affiliated transactions contained in section a of the investment company act the fund is requesting relief in this letter so that the redeeming shareholders may acquire class i shares of the portfolios in an inkind purchase using the inkind redemption proceeds received from the redeeming funds ii applicable law and legal discussion a applicable law section al of the investment company act in pertinent part makes it unlawful for an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person knowingly to sell to such registered investment company any security or other property except securities of which the buyer is the issuer the commission has observed that section a was designed mainly to prohibit a purchase or sale transaction when a party to the transaction has both the ability and the pecuniary incentive to influence the actions of the investment company under section aa of the investment company act an affiliated person of another person is defined to mean any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person section ac of the investment company act defines the term affiliated person of another person to mean any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person under section ae affiliated person is defined to mean the investment adviser of an investment company a redeeming shareholder may be considered an affiliated person of an affiliated person a secondtier affiliate of a portfolio because the redeeming shareholder may be considered an affiliated person of geam within the meaning of section ac by virtue of being under the common control of ge and geam may be considered an affiliated person of the portfolio under section ae by virtue of serving as the portfolios investment adviser alternatively certain redeeming shareholders may be considered secondtier affiliates of a portfolio because they may be considered affiliated persons of a redeeming fund by virtue of owning  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the redeeming fund and the redeeming fund and the portfolio may be considered affiliated persons of each other by virtue of being under the common control of geam their common adviser section a therefore may be interpreted to prohibit a redeeming shareholder from purchasing class i shares of a portfolio using the inkind proceeds of redemption from a redeeming fund because the inkind purchase may be viewed as the sale of securities to the portfolio although section a may be deemed to apply to a particular transaction the commission staff has granted noaction relief in the past when in the staffs view the transaction might be effected fairly without implicating the concerns underlying section a in the signature letter the staff granted relief from section a to permit affiliated redemption inkind transactions provided certain procedures were followed the staff was satisfied that the redemption inkind transactions described in that letter would be effected fairly and not implicate the concerns underlying section a for the reasons and under the circumstances described below we believe the staff can make a similar determination with respect to the proposed inkind purchase and therefore should grant the requested noaction relief b proposed procedures for inkind purchases the fund proposes to accept inkind purchases from a redeeming shareholder only pursuant to certain procedures that will be adopted by the board including a majority of those trustees who are not interested persons of the fund within the meaning of section a of the investment company act independent trustees these procedures will be substantially identical to the procedures the staff established in the signature letter for making inkind redemptions and we believe would adequately address the concerns underlying the prohibitions in section a of the investment company act the procedures are  the inkind purchase will be effected at the current net asset value per share of the relevant portfolio and will not dilute the interests of other shareholders of that portfolio the redemption inkind and the purchase inkind transactions will be effected simultaneously  the securities delivered to the portfolio by redeeming shareholders pursuant to the purchase inkind will be valued in the same manner as they would be valued for purposes of computing the portfolios net asset value per share securities for which quotations are readily available on a national securities exchange will be valued at the last quoted sales price or if there is no reported sale the security will be valued at the last quoted bid price certain fixed income securities will be valued by a dealer or by a pricing service based upon a computerized matrix system which considers market transactions and dealer supplied valuations valuations for municipal bonds will be based on prices obtained from a qualified municipal bond pricing service which prices will be based on the mean of the bid and ask prices of the secondary market  the inkind purchase will be consistent with a portfolios policies and undertakings relating to the sale of the portfolios shares as set forth in the prospectus and statement of additional information for the portfolio accordingly the inkind consideration accepted by a portfolio for the purchase of portfolio shares will consist of securities that are appropriate in type and amount for investment by the portfolio in light of its investment objectives and policies and current holdings  the inkind securities accepted by a portfolio will be limited to securities that are traded on public securities markets or for which quoted bid and asked prices are available and will not include the following types of securities or assets a securities which if accepted will have to be registered under the securities act of  as amended b securities issued by entities in countries which restrict the holdings of securities by nonnationals including investment vehicles such as the fund or otherwise limit the ability to transfer the security other than through a securities exchange transaction and c certain portfolio assets such as forward currency exchange contracts futures and option contracts and repurchase agreements that although they may be liquid and marketable involve the assumption of contractual obligations require special trading facilities or may only be traded with the counterparty to the transactions in order to effect a change in beneficial ownership a redeeming shareholder will receive from a redeeming fund and deposit to a portfolio cash for the portion of the redeeming funds assets represented by cash equivalents such as certificates of deposit commercial paper and repurchase agreements in addition a redeeming shareholder will receive and deposit cash for other securities and assets that are not readily distributable including securities and assets of the types described above in a b and c receivables and prepaid expenses net of a pro rata portion of all liabilities including accounts payable and for those portfolio securities not amounting to round lots eg  shares or which would not amount to round lots if included in the inkind distribution and purchase or fractional shares and accruals on these securities  the purchases inkind will be made only with the redemption proceeds a redeeming shareholder receives from a redeeming fund which has an investment objective and investment policies that are substantially similar to those of the portfolio in which the purchase inkind is to be made and which has the same investment adviser as or an investment adviser under common control with the portfolio  the purchases inkind for any portfolio will be made only with securities and cash that have been distributed pro rata from a redeeming fund to redeeming shareholders so that a redeeming shareholder will receive its proportionate share of every security and asset position in a redeeming funds portfolio subject to the exceptions noted above and will be effected in a manner that is consistent with the procedures set forth above in  to   the board including a majority of the independent trustees will determine no less frequently than quarterly that all purchases inkind made by redeeming shareholders during the preceding quarter a were effected in accordance with the various procedures b did not favor the redeeming shareholders to the detriment of any other shareholder of the portfolio and c were in the best interests of each portfolio  the fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which the purchase occurred the first two years in an easily accessible place a copy of its inkind purchase procedures as well as other records for the purchases inkind setting forth the identity of the purchasing shareholder a description of the composition of the relevant portfolios investment portfolio including each assets value immediately prior to the purchase inkind a description of each security delivered in connection with the purchase inkind the terms of the inkind purchase the information or materials upon which the asset valuations were made and a description of the composition of the relevant portfolios investment portfolio including each assets value one month after the inkind purchase  geam will consistent with its fiduciary duties disclose to the independent trustees the existence of and all of the material facts relating to any conflicts of interest between geam and the portfolios in a proposed inkind purchase to allow the independent trustees to approve the inkind purchase under the foregoing procedures no first or secondtier affiliated person of a portfolio would be in a position to overreach the portfolio by causing it to accept unwanted portfolio securities in connection with a purchase inkind transaction a redeeming shareholder would not be permitted to choose the portfolio securities of the redeeming funds to be distributed for redemption and to be used to purchase class i shares of the corresponding portfolios since each redeeming shareholder would receive a pro rata distribution of securities and cash from each redeeming fund the inkind redemption from the redeeming funds would be made under procedures that comply with those outlined in the signature letter which have been adopted by the board of trustees of the ge funds including a majority of the independent trustees in addition under the proposed procedures an inkind purchase of class i shares of the corresponding portfolios could only be made with the entire redemption proceeds and in portfolios that have substantially identical investment objectives policies and holdings as the redeeming funds under the proposed procedures the inkind securities to be used for redemption and purchase could not be valued in a way that would favor the redeeming shareholders to the detriment of other shareholders of the affected funds the procedures to be used to value the inkind securities in connection with an inkind purchase would be based on objective verifiable valuation measures and these procedures would be the same as those used to compute the net asset value of the affected funds the redeeming funds would value the securities for the inkind redemption on the same day that the portfolios would value the securities to be used for the inkind purchase of class i shares securities for which exchange quotations are readily available would be valued at the last quoted sales price or if there is no reported sale the security would be valued at the last quoted bid price certain fixed income securities would be valued by a dealer or by a pricing service based upon a computerized matrix system which considers market transactions and dealer supplied valuations in light of the protections afforded by the proposed procedures therefore no redeeming shareholder or other first or secondtier affiliate of a portfolio would be in a position to cause the portfolio to issue its share for inkind consideration that was not of equivalent value to the shares being issued c rule a the proposed procedures and the circumstances of the contemplated inkind transaction also satisfy many of the requirements of rule a under the investment company act there is added assurance therefore that the conflicts of interest which section a was intended to prevent are not likely to occur under the contemplated transaction rule a exempts from section a certain purchase and sale transactions between registered funds or between a fund and a person that is an affiliated person of the fund solely by virtue of having a common investment adviser common directors andor common officers to rely on rule a however various conditions must be satisfied including a the transaction must be for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of a security for which market quotations are available b the transaction must be effected at the current market price in accordance with rule ab c the transaction must be consistent with the policies of the funds involved as set forth in their filings made with the commission d no brokerage commissions fees except for customary transfer fees or other remuneration must be paid in connection with the transaction e the boards of the funds must have adopted procedures reasonably designed to provide that conditions a through d have been complied with and the boards must monitor such compliance quarterly f the boards of the funds must satisfy the fund governance standards of rule a under the investment company act and g the funds must maintain and preserve certain records regarding the transactions it is not so clear that the fund could meet all of the conditions for relying on rule a to effect the purchase inkind transaction first the transaction would not strictly be a cashforsecurities transaction as required by rule aa although we recognize that the staff has granted noaction relief in similar circumstances in the past based on arguments in the request letters that the right to receive cash from a redeeming fund is substantially equivalent to the use of cash second the portfolios pricing procedures as well as the procedures to be used to effect redemptions inkind from the redeeming funds will not follow precisely the methodology set forth in rule ab using net asset value valuation procedures would allow the redeeming funds and the portfolios to effect these transactions with a minimum of disruption to current operations in light of the various procedures that will accompany use of these valuation methods as described above including particularly the fact that the redemption inkind and purchase inkind would be effected at the same prices the use of these methods should not in any way result in disadvantages for the redeeming funds or portfolios nevertheless substantially all of the requirements of rule acg would be satisfied under the proposed inkind purchase and redemption transaction the transaction will be consistent with the policies of the fund and ge funds as set forth in their filings made with the commission the fund and the ge funds will not pay any brokerage commissions fees except for customary transfer fees or other remuneration in connection with the proposed redemption inkind and purchase inkind transaction the board will adopt procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the proposed transaction is effected in accordance with the guidelines set forth above and as applicable the requirements of rule aad at its quarterly meetings following an inkind investment the board including a majority of the independent trustees will determine whether a the securities transferred in the inkind investment were valued in accordance with the proposed procedures and b the acquisition of the securities was consistent with the policies of the portfolios as reflected in their registration statements and reports filed under the investment company act the board intends to satisfy the corporate governance standards of rule a under the investment company act by the compliance date the fund and ge funds will maintain and preserve certain records in accordance with rule ag d policy considerations there are no adverse policy considerations that should concern the staff under the proposed inkind transaction the terms of this investment would be reasonable and fair to shareholders of the redeeming funds and portfolios and consistent with the policies of the affected funds and the general purposes of the investment company act  fairness to shareholders the shareholders of the affected funds would benefit significantly by permitting the redeeming shareholders to effect the redemption and purchase inkind in the manner contemplated and such shareholders would not incur any material related costs as indicated by permitting the redeeming shareholders to redeem their shares of the redeeming funds inkind and to use these proceeds to acquire class i shares of corresponding portfolios the affected funds would avoid the significant brokerage costs that they would otherwise incur if the redemption and purchase were effected as cash transactions given the size of the transaction that is expected in the tens of millions of dollars the avoidance of brokerage costs would result in huge savings for shareholders of the affected funds without any offsetting associated costs the fairness and reasonableness of the inkind redemption and purchase transaction to shareholders of the affected funds is evident for another reason the redeeming funds and the portfolios have substantially identical investment objectives policies and holdings and differ materially only with respect to the size of institutions that may invest in one or the other of these funds and with respect to the management fees and other operating expenses that apply if the requested relief is not granted and no other avenue for possible relief may be pursued in a timely fashion shareholders of the affected funds would be significantly disadvantaged in such case the redeeming funds would be forced to sell portfolio securities they hold to realize cash proceeds to distribute to redeeming shareholders and would incur significant brokerage costs in doing so the assets of the redeeming funds would be correspondingly depleted and the net asset value of shares of these funds would be lower than would otherwise be the case with correspondingly lower returns to remaining shareholders of these funds in addition once the redeeming shareholders have invested their cash proceeds to purchase class i shares of the portfolios these portfolios would incur equally significant brokerage costs in purchasing substantially the same securities as those sold by the redeeming funds  consistency with general purposes of the investment company act the proposed inkind investment would be consistent with the general purposes of the investment company act which are to mitigate and so far as feasible eliminate the conditions enumerated in section b of the investment company act which adversely affect the national public interest and the interest of investors in particular under the proposed procedures as discussed above the inkind transaction would not present an opportunity for the affected funds to be operated or their portfolio securities selected in the interest of the redeeming shareholders rather than in the interest of all shareholders of the affected funds the redeeming shareholders would deposit a pro rata distribution of the securities and assets received as a result of an inkind redemption from the redeeming funds and because of the similarity in investment objectives policies and portfolio holdings of the portfolios and the redeeming funds no person would receive any advantage the inkind investment is also consistent with the interest of investors in the affected funds because it is designed to further the funds goal of avoiding the unnecessary brokerage and other investment expenses that would diminish the returns of all shareholders  consistency with investment policies the proposed transactions would be consistent with each portfolios investment policies as set forth in its prospectus the investment policies and limitations of each portfolio as set forth in its prospectus do not restrict the portfolios ability to accept investments inkind in addition the proposed inkind investments would be consistent with each portfolios objective to make longterm investments e exemptive orders the commission previously has granted an exemptive order to geam and the fund to permit inkind investments in substantially similar circumstances in addition the commission has granted other exemptive orders in similar circumstances although the procedures proposed above for effecting the inkind purchase more closely follow the procedures of the signature letter these procedures are not inconsistent with those included under the noted exemptive orders iii conclusion for the foregoing reasons we respectfully request that the staff agree not to recommend enforcement action to the commission for a violation of section a if the fund were to accept the inkind investment from ge affiliated investors we would be willing to respond to any questions the staff may have concerning this request or to supplement in any way the arguments made in this letter please call the undersigned at   or david hearth at   with any question in accordance with the provisions of securities act release no  december   we have enclosed seven additional copies of this noaction request sincerely wendell m faria for paul hastings janofsky  walker llp endnotes  in particular you represent that a redeeming fund invests in substantially identical underlying securities and in substantially the same proportional amounts as the corresponding portfolio  you state that purchasers of the investment class shares do not pay any sales charges including frontend contingent deferred or assetbased sales charges or shareholder service or distribution fees in connection with their investments in the portfolios  an inkind redemption entails a funds payment of redemption proceeds in the funds portfolio securities rather than cash you represent that the redemptions would essentially be effected pro rata in that each purchasing shareholder who redeems would receive a proportionate share of every security position in a redeeming funds portfolio except that the purchasing shareholder will receive cash in lieu of certain securities and other assets that are not readily distributable  you anticipate that the majority of proposed inkind purchases would occur during the quarter immediately following the first date that the purchasing shareholders are eligible to invest
