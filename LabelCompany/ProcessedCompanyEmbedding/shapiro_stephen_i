servicize a product  stephen shapiro   contact innovation insights by stephen shapiro servicize a product i am sunning myself with my family in florida right now hence the shortage of blog entries we have been busy every day so today has been my first day to relax and think and no surprise i have been thinking about innovation the balcony of my timeshare overlooks the water with boats the picture left is our view i always wanted a boat but am often reminded of a joke “what are the two happiest days in a boat owner’s life the day he buys his boat…and the day he sells it” boats are expensive and a pain to maintain in my previous blog entry i discussed ways of making products and services more accessible and affordable one idea was to “productize” a service the question of the day is how can boats be made more affordable and accessible maybe the answer is to “servicize” a product  let’s look at a few options… option  – make product cheaper if you want to make boats more affordable you can make them less expensive and maybe easier to maintain  as an owner this gives you the greatest flexibility and unlimited access to your boat  of course you need to do all of the work option  – timeshare most people only want a boat from time to time so another logical solution is to create a boat timeshare a quick google search shows that there are quite of them out there with this model a corporation owns the boats and sells “slices” yesterday i met a couple that get to go on a yacht for one week each year in a different location  this is nice if you only want a boat infrequently option  – fractional ownership another option is “fractional ownership” instead of a corporation owning the boat the individuals that use the boat own the boat they split all costs  this gives you greater flexibility with potentially more work option  – netflix model the most interesting option is one that uses the netflix model this gives you unlimited access to a number of boats you get two reservation slots as soon as you use one you get another this gives everyone equal access to the boats they want yet does not restrict how often they can be used you are also not limited to one boat or one location but rather have many to choose from  the company that owns the boats maintains and cleans them the only additional cost to the renter is fuel the total cost per year is less than the cost of the boat slip dues one company that offers this is the freedom boat club there are pluses and minus to each model  different options will appeal to different people  the key is to recognize that there are many ways to sell and price your products and services i love the netflix model and believe that it can be applied to many different businesses i am in the process of creating a netflix consulting model that will give clients unlimited access to me for one monthly subscription fee it will be designed in such a way that everyone gets equal access what other creative options are there for offering affordable and accessible products and services  thoughts on “servicize a product” britton manasco says december   at  pm this is a fascinating — and very timely — topic everyone should be asking how to make their offerings more accessible i was particularly impressed with how you flipped around everett rogers’ diffusion of innovations curve in your prior posts — putting the laggards first the last shall be first right britton manasco illuminating the future stephen shapiro says december   at  am thanks britton very observant yes the curve is flipped around rogers was talking specifically about the introduction of new technologies i am using the curve to match customers and capabilities here’s how i look at it the customer base is a bell curve as i drew it in the previous entries this is the level of sophistication of sorts your capabilities the products and services you offer have their own bell curve of sophistication the problem is most companies only study their existing customers – the middle of the bell curve they rarely talk to customers who left because your productsservices are not sophisticated enough for their high end needs and they even less frequently study markets in which potential customers are viewed as laggards therefore new products and services tend to only hit the middle of the bell curve but it is the two “margins” of the bell curve where the real untapped opportunities lie…in my humble opinion thanks steve leave a reply cancel reply return to blog home keep up to date with stephens innovation insights subscribe now to get

your productsservices affordable and accessible  stephen shapiro   contact innovation insights by stephen shapiro making your productsservices affordable and accessible one of my last blog entries discussed the need to create affordable and accessible solutions as a way of staying competitive given  globalization cheap labor and a damanged economy this makes more sense than ever here are three starter questions to ask to help you generate new ideas how can you productize a service one way to make a service more affordable and accessible is to turn it into a physical or digital product something that requires little or no human intervention in my earlier entry i talked about cybersettle automating insurance claims processing my innovation personality poker enables people to recreate one of my most popular speechesworkshops selfassessment tools can reduce reliance on consultants remote diagnostic technologies can speed medical exams and prequalify patients before they come to the doctor legalzoomcom offers affordable legal advice for people who might otherwise not seek counsel turbotax simplifies tax filing experts convert their intellectual property into books mps dvds digitally delivered training including elearning systems or online databases the possibilities are endless how can you offer a lowcost productservice in an earlier blog entry i quoted antoine de saintexupery author of the little prince who once said “perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add but when there is no longer anything to take away” i love that  ask “why are people really using our productsservices and what are the bare minimum ways of delivering the desired outcome”  netbooks are stripped down computers because most people want to do word processing and surf the net tata is offering a  car in india ok maybe that is a bit too scaled down ernst  young consulting now cap gemini once offered a subscription service ernie which provided small businesses with a lowcost alternative to high priced consulting dow corning the maker of siliconebased products created xiameter an internetbased division that sells product only in bulk… with no call centers  which features services or qualities can be reduced in order to tap into a new market how can i make my product addictive drug dealers know that if you get someone hooked on your product they will come back to buy more this strategy can be useful for attracting – and retaining – customers last month i spoke with the ceos of three software companies the one strategy that was pertinent to all three was the development of a stripped down version of the software…and potentially offering it for free the idea is to get the customer hooked and using the software on a regular basis then as the customer’s needs grow they will need to upgrade note this is not the same thing as offering something free today and then charging in the future i worked with a major computer manufacturer many years ago where this concept was applied their flagship computer was let’s call it the “f” series but that was too expensive for most companies so they introduced a much slower and less expensive computer – the “e” series interestingly the two models were  identical except a computer chip was added to the “e” to slow it down the company knew that many customers would eventually want an upgrade and they simply pulled out the chip and charged an exorbitant fee all three of these strategies move your innovation to the lefthand part of the bell curve above rather than the right all three can be used by any company to augment their existing products and services  the point is to make your “core competency” available to a broader market – without negatively diverting energies i will be including more strategies in future blog entries  thoughts on “making your productsservices affordable and accessible” pingback servicize a product  business innovation speaker and
