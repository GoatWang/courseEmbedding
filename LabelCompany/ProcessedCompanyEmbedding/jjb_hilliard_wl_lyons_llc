advisory publications disclosures research reports cost basis reporting disclosure helpful links municipal bond letters prospectus downloads risks of borrowing on margin understanding mutual funds public finance cost basis reporting disclosure provisions of the emergency economic stabilization act of  established cost basis reporting requirements for financial institutions including hilliard lyons according to the relevant irs regulations beginning with the  tax year we must report to the internal revenue service on client tax forms b gross proceeds as we have in the past along with cost basis for covered securities disposed as well as any information related to the amount of gain or loss and whether the gainloss is longterm or shortterm the act spawned many new regulations impacting related activities including identification of information reportable to the irs taxlotrelief methods transfer information protocol accounting for attributes of debt instruments etc additional details are set forth below describing related provisions and how they may affect you coverednoncovered securities  the regulations create a new reference to some of your investments distinguishing between covered and noncovered securities reporting obligations for financial institutions in this context are invoked for covered securities which are generally those purchased or acquired on or after effective dates defined in the regulations as illustrated below equity securities acquired on or after january   mutual fund and dividend reinvestment plan drip shares acquired on or after january   debt securities options and other investments identified by the irs acquired on or after january   the irs extended this date from the previously announced date of january   and has excluded many debt instruments from immediate subjectivity pending systems development ﻿noncovered securities are generally those acquired before the effective dates  transactions involving noncovered assets will continue to be reported as they have been in the past meaning there will be no cost basis information transmitted to the irs for sales of noncovered securities – only the gross proceeds will be transmitted to the irs even though it isn’t shared with the irs you will continue to receive this information in your yearend tax package as long as the data is housed in our systems according to the regulations you will continue to carry the reporting and reconciliation obligation for maintenance of adequate supporting documentation with respect to the basis of your noncovered assets hilliard lyons will continue to support you in this respect taxpayers should prepare for heightened reconciliation efforts between income tax returns and s for covered securities after the enactment of these provisions basis overview  the basis of your investment is used to measure gain or loss on the sale of an investment gain or loss is the difference between your adjusted tax basis and the amount your investment sells for prior to these regulations financial institutions did not transmit information about your basis to the irs basis is normally the original cost of your asset if you did not purchase your investment you received the asset as a gift inheritance or in a taxfree distribution then your basis is determined by something other than your original cost and your asset carries what is known as an adjusted basis occasionally it may be necessary to increase or decrease the basis of investments if the issuer declares a stock split a return of capital or undergoes merger activity you may need to begin carrying an adjusted basis for the investment depending on the terms of the event you may decide to sell part but not all of your position if you purchased shares at different times and prices you may have different tax bases for those separate lots there are different lot selection methods for identifying the basis of what you sold original cost if is carried at original cost it means that the original cost of the asset equals the basis thus if you purchase shares of stock for  your initial cost basis in those shares is  transferred basis if an asset has a transferred basis it means that your initial cost basis will be as it was in the hands of the person who transferred the asset to you gifted shares are the most common example of property with transferred basis the value of a gift is not included in the recipients taxable income nor may the donor deduct the value of gifts unless made to a qualified charity the recipient assumes the donors basis in the property and uses that amount to measure any applicable gain or loss when the property is sold recipients of gifts generally cannot use transferred basis for the purpose of determining a loss but rather would reduce the basis to an amount equal to that realized when sold affected taxpayers should consult a qualified tax advisor fair market value fmv basis generally applicable to property acquired from a decedent which is considered part of the decedent’s gross estate assets acquired from a decedent carry an adjusted basis equal to fair market value on either the dateofdeath or the alternate valuation date as elected on the decedents estate tax return the alternate valuation date is six months after the date of death and is a mechanism that can be used to reduce the estate tax liability only if the values of the assets have declined executors or personal representatives or successor trustees are vested with the authority to manage the assets to make elections as referenced and to provide instruction and direction as to the applicable basis amounts for assets acquired from decedents reinvestment you may have holdings in which you reinvest earnings if your share quantity increases when you reinvest then you have purchased a new tax lot which must be carried separately from the tax lot from which it arose reinvesting for new shares is equivalent to receiving an income distribution then purchasing new shares with the amount distributed to you stock splits stock dividends stock rights etc a stock split involves a division into more units of the same stock generally the aggregate value of the old and new shares should be the same a stock dividend is a proportionate distribution of stock to all the shareholders similar to a stock split it essentially subdivides the stock but tends not to impact the amount known as basis in both cases the result is an allocation of the basis proportionally from before the event to the resulting shares after the event open date content for stock received in a split or a stock dividend is the same as the holding period for the original shares for holdings of multiple lots basis must be allocated to the related lots proportionally tax lot relief methods tax lot relief methods define the sequence of retirement for differing tax lots of securities disposed if you have acquired assets in varying quantities amounts at different times you will have a variety of tax lots the tax lot relief method determines which lots are retired in the event of disposition including the relevant cost basis amount and holding period used in computing the gain or loss and whether or its longterm or shortterm hilliard lyons assumes you observe default tax lot relief as specified in the regulations use of alternate relief methods must be denoted by timely written notification as in the past you may choose a specific tax lot to assign to closed events by providing the instruction to your financial consultant not later than the settlement date once a specific tax lot has been sold federal tax regulations prohibit you or hilliard lyons from modifying that election after the settlement date of the trade consistent with current federal income tax regulations hilliard lyons generally observes a default tax lot relief method of first in first out fifo and applies amortization routines against subject debt instruments in accordance with default federal provsions please consult a tax advisor qualified in this subject matter if you should require additional information  account transfer  in the event of transfer between financial institutions the delivering firm provides cost basis information to the receiving firm for covered securities this information must generally be provided within  business days of the transfer event  if a delivering firm knows the lots that are noncovered they are not required to transmit costbasis data to the receiving firm but will generally do so as a courtesy corporate action  financial institutions are generally required to adjust cost basis for covered securities based on information disclosed by issuers regarding corporate actions  irs regulations establish reporting obligations for issuers to provide shareholders with relevant tax consequences for adjustment of cost basis information for such events hilliard lyons monitors corporate actions and relevant issuer disclosures for delivery to the holder in this connection property acquired in a corporate action event in the absence of adequate disclosure from the issuer will result in no
