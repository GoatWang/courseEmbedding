investment derivatives such as options futures forwards and swaps these instruments involve risks different from and in certain cases greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments for funds that can invest in foreign securities which may include emerging markets securities risks may be magnified due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries portfolios that hold a smaller number of securities may be more volatile than more diversified portfolios funds that invest in fixed income securities are subject to decreasing bond prices as interest rates rise and increasing bond prices as interest rates fall the values of mortgage related securities and assetbacked securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to prepayment risk in addition a bond’s credit rating reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal—the lower the rating the higher the risk of default if the issuer’s financial strength deteriorates the issuer’s rating may be lowered and the bond’s value may decline funds that invest in
