wieland adventist reformer goes to rest july th   email this  digg it leave your comment posted by daniel published in daily rambliniscings from the web wieland obituary … robert j wieland passed away on july   elder wieland was a true seventhday adventist who lived a long life of service and sacrifice to further the gospel to his ministry the seventhday adventist church is deeply indebted the current and strengthening interest in the messages of jones and waggoner and deepening study into the message of christ’s righteousness is to no small extent a result of the courageous work of elder wieland in  elder wieland and elder donald k short served as missionaries in africa at that time they both stood as delegates to the general conference held in san francisco when a call was given for delegates to communicate their concerns or advice to the elected leadership robert wieland had something to say with a deep soul burden of the work of god he wrote a letter of concern about misunderstandings of the gospel that were infiltrating the church his colleague donald short assisted him with advice and much prayer elder short decided that he would also sign the letter so elder wieland changed the pronouns and added the second name the two missionaries were asked to stay in america for further review of their document and of their position in the church in the meantime they prepared a more complete disclosure of their concern in a manuscript for church leadership that would be known as  reexamined ultimately church leadership discerned that elders wieland and short were being faithful to their calling as seventhday adventist pastors and missionaries the men were sent back to africa to continue in service from that point on the names wieland and short became inextricably linked together they were leaders in calling for the seventhday adventist church to gain all the blessings god intended when he sent us the “most precious message” which was presented at the minneapolis general conference in  in the providence of god the  reexamined manuscript passed from one person to another stirring many minds conscientious seventhday adventists began to understand that the reason why christ’s coming had been so long delayed was to be found in our failure to appropriate the blessings that were contained in messages god sent through jones at waggoner at minneapolis many church leaders who felt good about the status quo in the denomination worked to quell and stifle the concerns numerous books and responses to the  reexamined manuscript were written asserting that the “ message” of christ’s righteousness had already been widely accepted in the years since minneapolis these claims rang hollow as the denomination descended into deeper division and controversy concerning the nature of the gospel itself wieland and short for their part worked vigorously to bring to light the hundreds of testimonies ellen white wrote with regard to the  message they also worked to make the message available through publishing jones’ and waggoner’s books and sermons in addition they demonstrated clearly how this message is supported throughout the bible the names “wieland and short” were synonymous with dedicated seventhday adventists trying to reform the church when i was little in the ss i thank god so much for their dedication and zeal in seeing that the  message did not fall to the ground but was carried on to a new generation personally i had a few email exchanges with him around  as he strongly supported jack sequiera’s book “beyond belief” which clearly is teaching universalism in his replies he showed a strong leaning towards that view also which i hope he repented of before his passing may i be as true and faithful to the cause of god as he was and i hope to see him in heaven  the first to comment subscribes to comment rss or trackback url  sky said in october st  thank you brother for bringing this up for discussion i have read their publications for over three decades and i have come to the conclusion that they themselves were not able to decipher the  message this is what they themselves confessed the first time in their first edition of the  message reexamined pp saying “many even in the world today are trying to discover the light which god revealed to his people in  no one has so far been successful religious thinkers are yearning for something no one clearly understands though it would seem that a few are on the verge of discovery”  then in   years later in their revised edition on page  they again confessed that the message was still elusive to them “it would seem that  presents a problem unique in the long history of god’s confrontations with his people there is a message involved therein that seems more elusive than any in the history of past ages” can you imagine that ellen white had declared that the message was just as simple as abc but that we did not understand it “the matter of salvation is just as simple as abc but we don’t understand it” faith  works  may   in january of  after many years of searching the lord opened the eyes of my understanding as to what constituted that message it was then that i saw how simple it was and how we must receive it with the simple faith of a little child here is that message in a nutshell “present your case before god pleading the merits of the blood shed for you upon calvary’s cross” faith  works here is why “the merits of christ’s sacrifice are sufficient to present to the father in our behalf” steps to christ “we shall come in repentance and contrition with a despairing sense of our own finite weakness and learn that we must daily apply to the merits of the blood of christ that we may become vessels fit for the master’s use” faith and works  unless we do this daily we cannot be saved “unless he makes it his life business to behold the uplifted saviour and to accept the merits which it is his privilege to claim the sinner can no more be saved than peter could walk upon the water unless he kept his eyes fixed steadily upon jesus” testimonies to ministers  the message was indeed clear and simple it is our privilge to come to god just as we are sinful helpless dependent claiming the merits of the saviour as we do this we become one with christ and we are clothed with his robe of righteousness which is made manifest in obedience to all the commandments of god see testimonies to ministers p and faith and works p this is the only true faith which leads to the keeping of all the commandments of god this is the message in a nutshell i did not find this message presented in clear and distinct lines in the publications of the  message study committee simply because this message was elusave to them reflecting on the message mrs white wrote “how long will you hate and despise the messengers of god’s righteousness god has given them his message they bear the word of the lord there is salvation pardon and peace and joy in the holy spirit for you but only through the merits of jesus christ the grace of the holy spirit has been offered to you again and again” testimonies to ministers  “looking unto jesus and trusting in his merits we appropriate the blessings of light and joy and peace in the holy spirit” testimonies vol  thus she wrote “the only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces him as a personal saviour which appropriates his merits to ourselves” desire of ages  as we daily appropriate the merits of jesus by claiming them jesus places us close by his side encircling us with his human arm while with his divine arm he grasps the throne of the infinite he places his own merits in the censor in our hands to encourage our petitions to conclude “you cannot explain this faith that lays right hold upon the merits of the blood of a crucified and risen saviour to bring christ’s righteousness into your life clothed with the righteousness of christ and not your own righteousness you will not depend upon what you can do or what you will do” for “christ’s righteousness accomplishes everything” faith  works the lord used wieland and short to make me enquire about the  message so much so that it became my sole passion while taking theology in one or our universities in the early eighties i will always be thankful to him for that god bless laval  rublopz said in november th  brother laval pls review your theology i was worrying when i read your statement “unless we do this daily we cannot be saved” it seems that your you have a galatians’ mind i pray for you peace be with you ruben  esther fleary said in november th  thank you pastor wieland your sermons have been breath of fresh air we need more pastors like wieland to cleanup the tainted message coming

october   six questions with    robert wieland robert j wieland is a retired missionary and an ordained minister living in california he has served the church in varying capacities for over  years born into a lutheran home he discovered the sabbath truth while attending sunday school at a presbyterian church when he was in high school after attending southern junior college for two years he had to withdraw when he could not pay his tuition he later went on to attend washington missionary college and it was there that he discovered the beauty of the gospel by reading the glad tidings by e j waggoner his love for these truths met with opposition and he was told that there was no place “in the work” for him as a result he colporteured for a short time with little success and it was then that the general conference publishing director helped him eventually find a position pastoring a small church from there he went on to become a missionary in africa in the ’s he along with donald k short first started to raise the general conference’s consciousness about the church’s rejection of the message of righteousness by faith as proclaimed by e j waggoner and a t jones at the  general conference in minneapolis minnesota since then wieland and short who is now deceased have continued to proclaim this message ultimately publishing the book  reexamined in  in addition to this book he has also published over  other books including corporate repentance in search of the cross and grace on trial now  he is still as hopeful as ever that the lord will return during his lifetime  for the last  years you and the late donald short have been promoting the  message and calling for a corporate repentance for the churchs rejection of the message what has changed since you first began i must make it plain dks donald k short and i do not call for denominational repentance we have said that the laodicean message describes our denominational history and verse  is the lord jesus himself calling for corporate and denominational repentance over a hundred times ellen white has said that we in a corporate sense brought on our record denominationally the sin of insulting the holy spirit and rejecting christ just like the jews and the guilt in a great degree of withholding the message from our people and from the world the prime issue is this true arthur l white led the general conference personnel to believe that as leadership we accepted the message and we have it as our firm possession and we have been proclaiming the loud cry message intact ever since we are in need of nothing has anything changed in half a century yes thousands of people around the world have a rudimentary knowledge now of the significance of our sda history they can now pray intelligently and are better equipped to meet the issues of the last days anyone who wants to learn about the story of the latter rain and the loud cry beginning among us can find information readily available  in what ways are many adventists guilty of baal worship today only unconsciously but that was the case with the people also in the days of elijah—apostasy had come on them gradually and elijah understood ellen white recognized that the rejection of the message in  would make possible deception into a counterfeit she recognized in jones and waggoners message the fulfillment of the prophecy of the coming of elijah before the great and terrible day of the lord baal worship is the subtle deception of the worship of self disguised as the worship of christ the widespread adulation of people and leaders is evidence  what has been the general attitude toward you in the past few years among the church governing body a sincere effort was made by a former general conference president over a decade ago to investigate the  history and message the primacy of the gospel committee the chairman at first showed a keen interest and seemed to be understanding then when the president had to resign the opponents took over the committee the original agreement was that if the committee should end in disagreement both sides would make a report to be published by the general conference but only one was published  according to your understanding what is the main idea of the  message that the church finds so repulsive the ultimate answer the idea of overcoming sin per se and thus preparing to honor christ at the close of probation the  idea of the cleansing of the sanctuary is misrepresented as the false doctrine of perfectionism  at this late stage in your life do you think that christ will return while youre still alive i am in my nd year i cherish the same faith in the nearness of the lords return as i held when i was baptized at the age of —i thought the lord would come so soon that i would not be able to finish high school this is what the bible speaks of as the blessed hope i cherish it today i understand that the lord jesus himself wants to come the ongoing misery in the world weighs on his heart he longs to put an end to sin and cruelty but he cannot act unilaterally because he has taken upon his sinless nature our sinful nature and has become forever one of the human race the original dictum is still true it is not good that the man should be alone and that applies to jesus as the son of god and now the son of man he must have an help meet a bride who can understand him and sympathize with him it is she not he who has delayed the marriage of the lamb the agenda before the church now is to grow up out of our spiritual infancy unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ prepared to stand at his side as a bride stands at the side of her husband whom she has learned to know and to appreciate for what he is she gives him her heart in order for this development to take place it is necessary that the church learn to comprehend the length breadth depth and height of the love agape of christ the latter rain and the loud cry are not emotional excitement but a message the ultimate one of christ and him crucified the church at present does not comprehend what christ accomplished by his sacrifice on the cross the sundaykeeping evangelical understanding has gradually and unconsciously absorbed our attention the third angels message in verity will be christ and him crucified in its ultra high fidelity reality of truth  why hasnt christ returned yet the most precious message that the lord in his great mercy sent to prepare a people for christs coming has been kept from the church and from the world in a great degree he dares not come until his people are ready otherwise they would perish by the brightness of his coming be of good courage in the lord he will bless your work let us trust him even if he permits you to meet opposition hang on please keep me personally in the background as much as you can the ultimate blessing to come on the church must not be of a personal nature self must forever be out of sight

unpardonable sin in the writings of ellen g white they were written by k m duncan and ed peters and were presented at andrews university a couple of years ago good exploration of why people are lost in spite of the gospels legal justification january   at  pm rusty buckett said great article on the unbreakable man himselfmoregive us more september   at  am bibletruth said righteousness by faith is a wonderful biblical truth unfortunately this message is being used to teach that obediance to the law of god wont affect our salvation lucifers lie in eden was that you can break gods law and not surely die this is the same lie being preached in the pulpits today while we are justified by our faith in jesus christ and his sacrifice we have the ability as free moral agents to turn away from christ and choose evil eternal life will be given to thoes who maintain their relationship with christ by abiding in his love which is walking in his ways and keeping his commandments the  lies being used to destroy the adventist church are sin is a condition and not a choice sin can not be overcome while on this earth due to our sinful nature  christ had a special nature a special advantage over us salvation is by faith onlyobediance to gods commandments are not necessary all future sins are already forgiven no final attonment the law was nailed to the crossthese lies have laid the foundation
