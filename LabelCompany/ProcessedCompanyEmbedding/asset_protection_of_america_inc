protection strategies in plain english asset protection planners has helped protect millions of dollars in liquid assets tens of millions in real estate and hundreds of millions in investments for our clients we’ll address the popular topics and questions about asset protection asset protection from lawsuits when you have accumulated assets over many years of hard work the last thing you want is to lose them due to some litigation issue bankruptcy or court judgment however such incidents can be avoided with a bit of preparation and planning using asset protection strategies can put a stop to losing assets should you ever run into any serious problems regardless it can be difficult to understand the laws passed regarding asset protection and how particular types of assets may be legally shielded however when you look at the statistics  of the lawsuits in the world are filed in the united states therefore if you live in the us understanding how you can protect your assets from lawsuits becomes critical to understand how to protect your accumulated wealth from lawsuits this article covers various aspects of asset protection that can help shield you in case of litigation your assets are at risk many individuals with assets incorrectly assume that since they follow laws correctly they could never be sued others think that asset protection is only necessary for people with careers who are common targets of litigation such as physicians building contractors etc however the notion that “playing nice” or being in a profession with less perceived liability protect assets from litigation in the real world is both a dangerous and incorrect perception uncontrollable risks keep in mind that like a robbery getting into a lawsuit is up to the other guy not you there are several uncontrollable life occurrences that can create legal issues and threaten your assets tomorrow someone could slam their breaks on in front of you and you could get sued for far beyond the limits of your insurance policy the problem with these types of circumstances is that many people believe these things won’t happen to them the fact is that you are not immune they can happen to anybody and very unexpectedly if you have not approached the idea of establishing an asset protection plan yet you might lose your assets and possibly be forced to file for bankruptcy wind up in a divorce battle or must defend yourself in a civil lawsuit the unexpected many more unexpected issues exist that could put your assets at risk for example say you are the parent of an adolescent that winds up on the wrong side of a car accident and the injured party decides to sue you over the incident did you know that most devastating automobile accidents result in lawsuits of far greater than the insurance coverage this litigation could result in you losing all of your vulnerable assets to the other party since many of these issues are difficult to predict it’s best to seek out an asset protection plan before anything that might endanger your wealth occurs retirement plans and state law in the united states both federal and state law dictate how your assets can be shielded from a court decision what follows below is an example of various assets and the how the law works to shield those assets the purpose is to provide you with an overview of how you can legally protect some of your assets to avoid their loss should litigation occur traditional iras and roth iras as far as court proceedings are concerned both can be protected from loss in bankruptcy court the cap for asset protection with both types of iras is one million dollars the bankruptcy court may decide to adjust this to a higher number furthermore certain plans that have been rolled over like b and b plans come with no limit to their protection it is important to note that the cap of protection is only for bankruptcy court proceedings and is not applied in other court decision when court proceedings outside of bankruptcy court occur state law generally dictates the level of protection certain types of retirement plans receive no limits on protection from both bankruptcy and creditors retirement plans received as an employment benefit whether or not the plan receives coverage from the employee retirement income security act erisa fall under this category an unlimited cap also protects erisa retirement plans with two exceptions first if there is a qualified domestic relations order it may allow the courts to remove your assets and hand them over to a previous spouse or payee in these cases that shield can be lifted second if something happens and the irs hits you with tax levies the veil of protection is lifted therefore certain qualified plans do not count as erisa plans if that plan only protects the business owner or owners also called owner only plans owner only plans do not receive the same level of protection and state law cover these types of plans depending on what state where you live you may or may not have protection from having your home confiscated in a lawsuit some states offer significant protection to homeowners and others offer no protection at all so make sure you understand the homestead protection laws in our state annuities and life insurance protection may offer some protection however the rates of return on the money put into these plans are usually poor state law also dictates whether or not annuities or life insurance are protected in some states the cash surrender values of life insurance as well as earnings from an annuity contract are protected in other states protection is offered to the beneficiary and his or her interest to the extent that it provides a meager living however some states offer no protection therefore become aware of your state’s requirements and how they might affect you a few easy steps although some people still seem to approach asset protection with a kneejerk reaction after they are sued there are many sound and solid legal ways to protect your assets but the protective measures almost always work best when put in place before a legal attack optimal asset protection planning means putting up your defenses up before any creditors launch attacks to access your wealth when your assets are already protected and you encounter a lawsuit the creditors know or will quickly find out that they will have difficulty getting through your defenses and may not bother to try instead this creditor will be more likely to seek a settlement rather than attempt to wade through the legal process and costs of attempting to reach protected assets here are a few approaches you can take to protect your assets the following list provides a breakdown of some of some of the most powerful asset protection steps you can legally take to ensure the safety of your wealth  asset protection trust form an asset protection trust to keep your wealth safe asset protection experts agree that forming a trust in places such as the cook islands and nevis offer the strongest defense an onshore trust formed in a state may also be an option for you especially if you live in one of the few states that offer asset protection trusts some of the states that currently offer assetprotection trusts include nevada alaska rhode island delaware and south dakota the problem is that we have seen the penetrated repeatedly because they are with the judge’s reach offshore trusts put the ball beyond the reach of your local courts in most offshore and onshore trust jurisdictions an individual is not required to be a resident of the state or country where he or she is seeking to form the trust because the offshore trust has a trustee that is outside of your local court’s jurisdiction that trustee is not required to abide by your local court orders if your local judge demands the money in the trust be forfeited the foreign trustee can refuse to comply domestic trusts do not have this advantage with an asset protection trust an independent trustee is put in place to oversee the trust assets placed into this type of trust will be difficult for creditors to seek out during litigation some of these trusts offer so much protection that you can even seal them off from exspouses should you decide to do so to ensure you form your trust correctly so that your trust protects your assets your trust must comply with the following requirements you must make sure that when you form the trust you make it irrevocable with an offshore trust you can actually make changes to the trust with the trustee’s assistance you have to appoint an independent trustee this independent trustee must be either an individual with residency in the same jurisdiction as the trust this can be a licensed trustee in some cases a bank the trust must include a rule that allows distributions to occur only when the trustee agrees to them there are also safetyvalve provisions for you to change trustee if your trustee does not cooperate the trust must also include a spendthrift clause a spendthrift clause is wording in a trust document that prevents creditors from attaching the trust assets before they are distributed to the beneficiary with a domestic trust depending on the state either part or all of the assets needs to be found within the same state that you form the trust in with an offshore trust in the cook islands nevis and belize assets can be located anywhere that being said the assets should not be located in a jurisdiction such as the us or a bank with us branches where they can be seized regardless of whether or not they are in the trust the trust’s administration as well as its required documents need to be located in the jurisdiction where the trust is created for those individuals who wish to pursue an asset protection trust remember that you should seek assistance from an asset protection specialist when forming your trust this action will greatly enhance the likelihood that the trust will be established properly there are simply too many variables that could expose your assets to lawsuits after all this is your money  if you do not establish trusts for a living and keep up on the

equipment and transferring them into asset protection tool such as an offshore trust you make your equity much less interesting to creditors equity stripping decreases the value of the assets moves

protection opportunity when forming an flp assets are usually moved into it and traded for an interest in the partnership once the assets are placed into the flp the uniform limited partnership act helps to shield those assets from creditors furthermore the owner of the flp can maintain the flp itself as well as the assets as far as your limited partner shares go there is no significant market value for them therefore your share value for accounting and tax purposes may be worth much less than what the originally transferred asset was worth possibly saving you money in taxes talk with a

helped protect millions of dollars in liquid assets tens of millions in real estate and hundreds of millions in investments for our clients we’ll address the popular topics and questions about asset protection asset protection from lawsuits when you have accumulated assets over many years of hard work the last thing you want is to lose them due to some litigation issue bankruptcy or court judgment however such incidents can be avoided with a bit of preparation and planning using asset protection strategies can put a stop to losing assets should you ever run into any serious problems regardless it can be difficult to understand the laws passed regarding asset protection and how particular types of assets may be legally shielded however when you look at the statistics  of the lawsuits in the world are filed in the united states therefore if you live in the us understanding how you can protect your assets from lawsuits becomes critical to understand how to protect your accumulated wealth from lawsuits this article covers various aspects of asset protection that can help shield you in case of litigation your assets are at risk many individuals with assets incorrectly assume that since they follow laws correctly they could never be sued others think that asset protection is only necessary for people with careers who are common targets of litigation such as physicians building contractors etc however the notion that “playing nice” or being in a profession with less perceived liability protect assets from litigation in the real world is both a dangerous and incorrect perception uncontrollable risks keep in mind that like a robbery getting into a lawsuit is up to the other guy not you there are several uncontrollable life occurrences that can create legal issues and threaten your assets tomorrow someone could slam their breaks on in front of you and you could get sued for far beyond the limits of your insurance policy the problem with these types of circumstances is that many people believe these things won’t happen to them the fact is that you are not immune they can happen to anybody and very unexpectedly if you have not approached the idea of establishing an asset protection plan yet you might lose your assets and possibly be forced to file for bankruptcy wind up in a divorce battle or must defend yourself in a civil lawsuit the unexpected many more unexpected issues exist that could put your assets at risk for example say you are the parent of an adolescent that winds up on the wrong side of a car accident and the injured party decides to sue you over the incident did you know that most devastating automobile accidents result in lawsuits of far greater than the insurance coverage this litigation could result in you losing all of your vulnerable assets to the other party since many of these issues are difficult to predict it’s best to seek out an asset protection plan before anything that might endanger your wealth occurs retirement plans and state law in the united states both federal and state law dictate how your assets can be shielded from a court decision what follows below is an example of various assets and the how the law works to shield those assets the purpose is to provide you with an overview of how you can legally protect some of your assets to avoid their loss should litigation occur traditional iras and roth iras as far as court proceedings are concerned both can be protected from loss in bankruptcy court the cap for asset protection with both types of iras is one million dollars the bankruptcy court may decide to adjust this to a higher number furthermore certain plans that have been rolled over like b and b plans come with no limit to their protection it is important to note that the cap of protection is only for bankruptcy court proceedings and is not applied in other court decision when court proceedings outside of bankruptcy court occur state law generally dictates the level of protection certain types of retirement plans receive no limits on protection from both bankruptcy and creditors retirement plans received as an employment benefit whether or not the plan receives coverage from the employee retirement income security act erisa fall under this category an unlimited cap also protects erisa retirement plans with two exceptions first if there is a qualified domestic relations order it may allow the courts to remove your assets and hand them over to a previous spouse or payee in these cases that shield can be lifted second if something happens and the irs hits you with tax levies the veil of protection is lifted therefore certain qualified plans do not count as erisa plans if that plan only protects the business owner or owners also called owner only plans owner only plans do not receive the same level of protection and state law cover these types of plans depending on what state where you live you may or may not have protection from having your home confiscated in a lawsuit some states offer significant protection to homeowners and others offer no protection at all so make sure you understand the homestead protection laws in our state annuities and life insurance protection may offer some protection however the rates of return on the money put into these plans are usually poor state law also dictates whether or not annuities or life insurance are protected in some states the cash surrender values of life insurance as well as earnings from an annuity contract are protected in other states protection is offered to the beneficiary and his or her interest to the extent that it provides a meager living however some states offer no protection therefore become aware of your state’s requirements and how they might affect you a few easy steps although some people still seem to approach asset protection with a kneejerk reaction after they are sued there are many sound and solid legal ways to protect your assets but the protective measures almost always work best when put in place before a legal attack optimal asset protection planning means putting up your defenses up before any creditors launch attacks to access your wealth when your assets are already protected and you encounter a lawsuit the creditors know or will quickly find out that they will have difficulty getting through your defenses and may not bother to try instead this creditor will be more likely to seek a settlement rather than attempt to wade through the legal process and costs of attempting to reach protected assets here are a few approaches you can take to protect your assets the following list provides a breakdown of some of some of the most powerful asset protection steps you can legally take to ensure the safety of your wealth  asset protection trust form an asset protection trust to keep your wealth safe asset protection experts agree that forming a trust in places such as the cook islands and nevis offer the strongest defense an onshore trust formed in a state may also be an option for you especially if you live in one of the few states that offer asset protection trusts some of the states that currently offer assetprotection trusts include nevada alaska rhode island delaware and south dakota the problem is that we have seen the penetrated repeatedly because they are with the judge’s reach offshore trusts put the ball beyond the reach of your local courts in most offshore and onshore trust jurisdictions an individual is not required to be a resident of the state or country where he or she is seeking to form the trust because the offshore trust has a trustee that is outside of your local court’s jurisdiction that trustee is not required to abide by your local court orders if your local judge demands the money in the trust be forfeited the foreign trustee can refuse to comply domestic trusts do not have this advantage with an asset protection trust an independent trustee is put in place to oversee the trust assets placed into this type of trust will be difficult for creditors to seek out during litigation some of these trusts offer so much protection that you can even seal them off from exspouses should you decide to do so to ensure you form your trust correctly so that your trust protects your assets your trust must comply with the following requirements you must make sure that when you form the trust you make it irrevocable with an offshore trust you can actually make changes to the trust with the trustee’s assistance you have to appoint an independent trustee this independent trustee must be either an individual with residency in the same jurisdiction as the trust this can be a licensed trustee in some cases a bank the trust must include a rule that allows distributions to occur only when the trustee agrees to them there are also safetyvalve provisions for you to change trustee if your trustee does not cooperate the trust must also include a spendthrift clause a spendthrift clause is wording in a trust document that prevents creditors from attaching the trust assets before they are distributed to the beneficiary with a domestic trust depending on the state either part or all of the assets needs to be found within the same state that you form the trust in with an offshore trust in the cook islands nevis and belize assets can be located anywhere that being said the assets should not be located in a jurisdiction such as the us or a bank with us branches where they can be seized regardless of whether or not they are in the trust the trust’s administration as well as its required documents need to be located in the jurisdiction where the trust is created for those individuals who wish to pursue an asset protection trust remember that you should seek assistance from an asset protection specialist when forming your trust this action will greatly enhance the likelihood that the trust will be established properly there are simply too many variables that could expose your assets to lawsuits after all this is your money  if you do not establish trusts for a living and keep up on the daytoday changes you would be putting your assets at great risk don’t rely on an amateur spend what it takes to have it done right there is a number or inquiry form on this page for more information  accountsreceivable financing borrow against your accounts receivable there are financing companies that will so so this may help make your receivables much less tempting for creditors so using your business receivables and borrow against them once you do this you can then move the cash to an offshore asset protection trust to keep it out of harm’s way by moving your wealth from easytoget to hardtoget you help decrease the value of the business assets and make them very unattractive for creditors  equity stripping much like accountsreceivable financing equity stripping requires you to take out a loan against the asset and then transfer the money received from the loan into a legal tool that protects your assets by stripping the equity out of certain assets such as real estate and equipment and transferring them into asset protection tool such as an offshore trust you make your equity much less interesting to creditors equity stripping decreases the value of the assets moves the loan proceeds into a financial fortress making it much more difficult for creditors to take what is yours  family limited partnerships a family limited partnership flp offer an excellent asset protection opportunity when forming an flp assets are usually moved into it and traded for an interest in the partnership once the assets are placed into the flp the uniform limited partnership act helps to shield those assets from creditors furthermore the owner of the flp can maintain the flp itself as well as the assets as far as your limited partner shares go there is no significant market value for them therefore your share value for accounting and tax purposes may be worth much less than what the originally transferred asset was worth possibly saving you money in taxes talk with a knowledgeable licensed tax advisor asset protection tips
