compensation benchmarking understanding and having a comparative analysis of the compensation of senior banking executives in the banking industry is a key element considered by the committee in making compensation decisions similar to the company’s past internal practices pearl meyer assisted the committee with defining a peer group of institutions of similar asset size and regional location the peer group includes the two comparable banks located in the state of maine and other banks located in similar nonmetropolitan areas in the northeast the comparable companies are reviewed annually and may change slightly depending on changes either in the market or in the peer group banks themselves the peer group targets approximately  institutions ranging from twothirds to two times the company’s size in terms of assets the overall objective is to position the company at approximately the median salary levels of the peer group performance factors will also be taken into account should a company in the peer group have performance that varies greatly from that of the group andor the company we may discount a defined peer bank or drop a company from the group should performance

the other key component of compensation for most employees is the stakeholder cash bonus program this program is not available to seos and certain other senior officers the stakeholder program was

undue risk the committee believes that this performancebased program provides a reward for high levels of current performance without sacrificing the achievement of longterm goals each year specific key performance indicators are chosen along with company wide financial performance trigger levels the objective of the program is to align the performance of employees with the company’s short and longterm objectives so neither set of goals is sacrificed for the other shortterm incentive plan  in  the board of directors approved a shortterm incentive plan for the five seos and certain other senior officers of the company this element of the compensation program is specifically designed to ensure clarity of expectations in terms of expected results on a shortterm basis to recognize and reward achievement of annual business goals and to motivate and reward superior performance this program also ensures that incentives are appropriately riskbalanced in that they do not motivate or reward excessive risk taking and ensure that the company is competitive with the market in order to attract and retain talent needed to grow the company the shortterm incentive is intended to be a cash bonus longterm incentive plan  in  the company’s shareholders voted to establish a new equitybased long term incentive plan which grants authority to issue stock options restricted stock and other equitybased grants to retain existing highperforming employees and to attract new members to the management team should the need arise the purpose of this plan is to incentivize executives through equity ownership and align their interests with those of the shareholders while providing longerterm incentives tied to overall company performance it is among the objectives of this plan that by having a portion of the executive’s compensation tied to the performance of the company’s stock the individual will be rewarded for enhancing longterm shareholder value the mid to longterm outlook of this type of compensation serves as a balance to the shortterm rewards of base compensation and the shortterm incentive plan stock options and restricted stock grants are also intended to encourage an executive to remain with the company the amount of options or restricted stock granted reflects the executive’s position in the organization level of responsibility impact on the company’s

volumes or other shortterm measures but is instead focused on a balance of measures which reward enhancing the company’s longterm viability and performance the company has extensive risk monitoring
