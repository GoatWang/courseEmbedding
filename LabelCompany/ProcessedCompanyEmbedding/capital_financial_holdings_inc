filings  reports code of ethics business continuity plan privacy contact us from the president our core business the financial services industry has been along with the rest of the business community an engrossed audience in the unusual and unpredictable political atmosphere which began with the presidential campaign and continued through the new days and months of a new president  the effect of a new administration is still unknown for our business although the stock market and business community has shown strength and resilience so far this year  similarly our company has gone through an unusual and unpredictable period of change in recent months as outlined in the following financial highlights and in our financial reports the company incurred a loss for the  year end obviously this is a major concern to be addressed  as a fact of business life our company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to potentially significant litigation risks issuers of several alternative products sold by capital financial services inc in the  to  date range while the company’s broker dealer operation was under a former management group had financial difficulties and went into receiverships or otherwise failed as a result of the failure of those alternative products the company has been subject to arduous expensive and time consuming legal andor arbitration proceedings stemming from that regrettable period for years on december   the company made a settlement payment in the amount of  and in december   without admission of liability the company recorded a  liability both on matters arising from the  era in september of  the company settled all claims between the company and its former liability insurer in exchange for payment by the company of  again a matter relating back to the  era  the expense of settlements alone for matters relating back to  cost the company  in  and that number does not include the outside legal fees of defending these suits  without these legal settlements and the legal fees that accompanied them the company would have been profitable in   my goal has been to rid the company of this burdensome and incapacitating litigation the good news is that i believe that during the year ended december   the last of these ominous matters were settled or resolved and happily none of our current management team was involved in the decisions that initiated these problems  because we are in a litigious society and a financial service business legal liability will continue but hopefully at more manageable costs  in the coming year we will look for innovative ways to grow control costs and gain revenues   new department of labor rules currently scheduled to be implemented in stages between june  of this year and january of  will create new requirements and procedures for our business  the uncertainty of the pending regulatory requirements has definitely created anxiety in the financial services industry and financial services professionals  a few of our financial service representatives have chosen to retire rather than learn new rules and procedures  we will continue to move forward with the rest of the industry as required in the last quarter of  we purchased an office building about two miles from our current rented offices remodel and upgrades have been in process on the new office facility since the beginning of   the new facility is much more modern and technology friendly than our current facility and allows room for us to expand both people wise and technologically when opportunities present themselves  progress on the remodel and preparation of our new company headquarters has gone well so far with only limited setbacks and issues with the project although the new building is larger than our current needs we are considering options including renting a portion creating an office condominium and selling a portion andor potentially growing into the space over time  we are anticipating moving into our new facility in june of  in time for our annual meeting in july   if you have the opportunity to attend the annual meeting you are welcome to a tour of the facility as our shareholder meeting will be held at the new office facility our goal for  is to grow generate revenues and profits for our company and you its shareholders and build a strong and sustainable dividend
