in terms of going long or short the opinions takes up to  years worth of historical data and runs these prices through thirteen different technical indicators after each calculation the program assigns a buy sell or hold value for each study depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study for example if the price is above the moving average of the stock then this is generally considered an upward trend or a buy note a security needs to have at least  active trading days in order to generate an opinion reading calculations the short medium and long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups the overall indicator is a composite of all  studies listed on the page a buy is assigned  point a sell is assigned  point a hold is assigned  points the indicator value is determined by adding up the totals for the different groups and dividing this sum by the number of studies in the group the indicator is expressed in terms of a percentage if the total is greater than zero then this is a buy if the total is zero then this is a hold if the total is less than zero then this is a sell to keep the results in a more logical format we factor the overall opinion by  to keep the end result in multiples of  percentage points with the exception of a  buy or sell this is why the opinion indicators will be displayed as      and  for example rather the exact percentage value opinions are updated every ten minutes throughout the day using delayed data from the exchangessupport and resistance this section shows a snapshot view of the traders cheat sheet with the last price and four separate pivot points  support levels and  resistance points the last price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed and will not update every  seconds as the last price at the top of the quote page does the last price will update only when the page is refreshed pivot points are used to identify intraday support resistance and target levels the pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows where h l c are the current days high low and close respectively support and resistance points are based on endofday prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open or the next trading session if the market is closed pivot point p  h

of the strength of the signal compared to the strength of the signal historically the strength can be one of the following five readings maximum strong average weak minimum maximum is the strongest this signal has been in the historical period and minimum is the weakest the signal has been in the historical period the stronger a signal strength the less volatile the signal for example a maximum buy signal is less likely to change to a hold or a sell signal than a weak buy signal a hold signal does not have any strength signal direction  buysell signal direction the signal direction is a shortterm day measurement of the current movement of the signal regardless if signal is a buy or sell the direction is an indication of whether the most recent price movement is going along with the signal the buysell direction can be one of the following five readings strongest strengthening average weakening weakest a buy signal with a strongest direction means a buy signal which is becoming stronger similarly a sell signal with a strongest direction is becoming stronger the direction goes with the signal hold signal direction the signal direction of a hold signal is a shortterm day measurement of where the signal is heading be it toward a buy signal or a sell signal the hold direction can be one of the following five readings bullish rising steady falling bearish a bullish hold signal indicates that the signal is heading toward a buy configuration and a bearish hold signal indicates that the signal is heading toward a sell configuration  barchart opinion  trading performance

displayed a technical chart contains six months worth of daily price activity with the open high low and close for each bar presented in a display box above the chart each data point can be viewed by moving your mouse through the chart the vertical bars below the chart represent volume and are colorcoded to indicate market activity for the day an up day where the price is greater than the previous price will show a green bar a down day where the price is less than the previous price will show a red bar when the price is unchanged compared to the previous price volume will show as a blue bar on futures charts the horizontal purple line above the volume bars represents open interest technical charts have the option to create spread charts  with the ability to choose from a number of common spreads such as corn  soybeans crush and wheat butterfly or allowing you to enter your own custom spread calculation supporting all futures equities index and forex symbols chart settings a chart form resides below the chart this is where you can change the symbol style time frame and other chart settings if you are logged in to your my barchart account you will also see a dropdown list for any chart templates youve previously saved simply select one from the list and the settings on the template will be applied to the current chart basic chart bar type  choose from ohlc bars candlesticks hollow candlesticks line or area volume on  displays or hides the volume for the symbol time frame  determines the period frequency and amount of data that will be displayed on the chart time period and startend dates for frequency choose from intraday daily weekly or monthly for commodity contracts you may also select a chart for the contract nearest futures contract or a continuation chart nearest futures and continuation charts commodity charts have three additional frequencies for daily weekly and monthly data contract nearest and continuation dailyweeklymonthly contract will plot prices for that specific contract dailyweeklymonthly nearest futures will use whatever contract was the nearest futures contract on the date of the given bar the price box at the top shows the contract that was used to build the corresponding bar dailyweeklymonthly continuation chart will always use the same month specified in the chart form to build the given bar the price box at the top shows the contract that was used in this case december or z  the information is backdated to the start of the period so on a minute chart information in the period dated  includes all trades between  and  inclusive a trade at  would be included within the next bar dated  a default time period is set based on your frequency setting for example an intraday chart will use a time period of  days while a daily chart uses a time period of  months you may change the time period to increase or decrease the density of the bars displayed on the chart the longer the time frame the closer together the individual bars the shorter the time frame the more distance between the bars you may override or further define the time period or generate a historical chart by entering a start and end date for the data for example you can get a daily chart with  months of data from one year ago by entering an end date from one year back display settings  further define what the chart will look like price box  when checked displays a data view window as you mouseover the chart showing ohlc for the bar and all indicator values for the given bar price scale  when on scale on the right of the chart shows prices  change scale  when on scale on the right of the chart shows the percent change from the open linear scale  when on scaling will calculate the most intelligent scale using the high the low and a series of acceptable divisors for possible scales logarithmic scale  when on uses logarithmic scaling instead of the linear scaling spread chart spread charts allow you to choose from a number of common commodity spread chart calculations you may also create your own custom spread chart by selecting up to three commodity contracts and multipliers or by entering your own custom spread expression the calculated results are displayed as a line chart expression shows the calculation used to create the chart when you select a common spread from the dropdown list or when you create a futures spread using the fields on the form the expression is built automatically for you if you want to create your own custom expression you can enter the calculation directly into the expression field valid syntax for an expression calculation includes the use of addition  subtraction  multiplication  and division  between each leg calculations are performed from left to right unless you change the order of the calculation using parentheses examples ibmdell subtracts the last price of dell from ibm ibmdell multiplies ibm by two then adds the price of dell dellibm multiplies dell by two then divides by three then adds ibm dellibm multiplies dell by two then divides the result by the sum of three plus ibm dxyspx subtracts the sp  index from the dollar index usdcadcadaud adds the canadian dollaraustralian dollar to the us dollarcanadian dollar note for futures contracts barcharts charting application commonly uses the  symbol on futures contracts as a shortcut to specify the month for example zc will return the front month zc returns the second month out zc returns the third month out etc when creating a custom expression using futures contracts you must use parentheses to group the order of the calculation in the expression zczczc will add the front second and third months for corn then divide the result by three zczzchzck will add december  corn march  corn and may  corn together then divide the results by three zczc will multiply the front month for corn by  then add the result to the third month out for corn multiplied by two zc will take the second month out for corn and multiply the price by   common spreads choose from a number of common commodity spreads the expression will be displayed once youve made a selection from the list create a futures spread select up to three different commodities including the month year multiplier and function     between the second and third leg the expression will be built and displayed in the expression field as you enter the different legs of the spread comparison chart  select up to three symbols to compare against this will generate a chart with the price data of the symbols overlayed to produce a chart of percent changes between symbols check the percent change box the colors of the boxes green purple red indicate the color of the line that will be drawn on the chart for the symbol you may also
