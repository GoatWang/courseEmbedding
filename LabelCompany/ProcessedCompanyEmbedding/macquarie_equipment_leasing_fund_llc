leasing is proof that it makes good business sense around  percent of us companies lease some or all of their equipment a leasing arrangement may be more affordable than you think if you have good credit and can show ability to pay a third party lender will purchase whatever you need up front and allow you to make regular payments over time this guide will show you the advantages to equipment leasing it will teach you to compare lenders get quotes and negotiate the best deal before you call an equipment lease supplier let us help you do your homework an informed decision is always the best decision the benefits of equipment leasing there are several benefits to leasing that you may not have thought of more spending power unlike bank loans the upfront costs of equipment leasing are minimal just two payments in advance are typically required with more spending money in your pocket you can focus on other priorities such as marketing increasing manpower or expanding your operation uptodate equipment technology moves at lightning speed and your rival down the street may offer impressive services that you cannot provide with some leases it is possible to arrange equipment upgrades that is why you are always in step with ahead of and the competition in productivity and results tax breaks in some agreements lease payments are fully deductible business expenses that makes more sense than treating your depreciating equipment as a capital expenditure your tax advisor can help you better understand the impact of leasing endless leasing possibilities the kind of equipment for lease is not limited to ordinary business needs such as phone systems and office furniture industry agriculture technology and food services are just a few of the fields with available products before you decide to lease think about what you are willing and able to spend rarely can you lease for an amount less than  lenders also shy away from intangible assets such as software maintenance and warranties it is possible to repossess a computer in the event of default but costs for soft assets cannot be recouped however given the many benefits of leasing it is worth pursuing comparing lenders for financing you will choose from one of the following a leasing broker leasing brokers act as intermediaries when you place your request your broker will shop banks and financial institutions on your behalf since they know who is most likely to give you financing brokers can save you a lot of legwork a captive leasing company most equipment manufacturers have a subsidiary company that handles their lease agreements you probably would not deal with a company like this unless you know exactly what equipment you need and lease it directly from a dealer an independent lessor independent lessors lease directly to businesses they may include banks or financial institutions that diversify but many specialize in equipment leasing entering into an equipment lease should feel like forming a partnership since your agreement may be long term you should completely trust your lessor just as you do your insurance agent or the dealer from whom you purchase all your cars you should not be rushed into a decision the lessor should be knowledgeable about the specific industry you are in he should have answers to all your questions lots of experience and a proven track record get references preferably from businesses similar to your own and follow up ask each contact if he was treated fairly and got a lease that met his needs ask how much help he had with the application and paperwork ask if he would use this lessor again in short research your lessor just as thoroughly as he is researching you getting quotes when you approach prospective lenders for quotes they will need to know the cost of the equipment and desired length of the lease tell them whether or not you intend to eventually purchase the pieces with four to six quotes you will have a good idea of the going rate for your equipment be sure you understand how the quote was calculated for example find out it if figured in a security deposit and how many advance payments were included do not expect quotes to be exactly on the penny your payments may be slightly higher or lower depending on your credit history finally be clear about the circumstances under which your rate can change if the lease allows your lender to hike your rate or charge an exorbitant fee for one late payment find another lender many leasing companies require at least two years of operation and a credit score of  at the very minimum ask what the requirements are before you apply a business loan may be more suitable you should not fill out an application until you have firmly decided equipment leasing applications work a lot like credit applications and excessive inquiries can affect your credit report getting a better deal with the right lessor and a little business savvy you may be able to get a lower rate negotiate the purchase price it never hurts to ask especially if you have a good relationship with your lender or have been in business a long time negotiate the interest rate rates for leases under
