may    nanoviricides files quarterly report for period ending  more   a new era in targeted antiviral therapeutics imagine coursing through the blood stream chasing through the body grabbing and destroying the offending virus particles nanoviricides inc is striving to bring this imagination to fruition a nanoviricide® as defined by the company is a nanomachine that is armed to destroy a particular kind of virus which virus that information is programmed into the nanoviricide akin to the postal address on an envelope biomimetic technology to fool viruses a nanoviricide is an agent designed by the company to fool a virus into attaching to this antiviral nanomachine in the same way that the virus normally attaches to the receptors on a cell surface once attached the flexible nanoviricide glob wraps around the virus and traps it in the process the virus also loses its coat proteins that it needs to bind to a cell the virus is thus neutralized and effectively destroyed a nanoviricide completes the task of dismantling the virus particle without immune system assistance this is the putative or designed mechanism of action of a nanoviricide thus nanoviricides represent the next great advance in immunotherapeutics antibodies and vaccines which are currently well established antiviral strategiesmore nanoviricides in the news shelton company sets sites on fighting

chapter from jain biopharmas market report on antivirals                    advanced technologies  adif™ technologies we believe that our technologies and capabilities for attacking different viruses are fairly well demonstrated in addition we have developed accuratedruginfield™ or adif™ technologies that may show efficacy in treating epidemics like hn sars or ebola by developing a targeted therapeutic in the field to prevent the spread of the disease adif technology does not require any knowledge of the molecular biology of the virus or even its specific identification an accurate drug specifically targeted at the virus can be developed in the field from nanomicelles stockpiled beforehand this enables a rapid response timeframe as short as  weeks for initial drug doses and potentially less than  months for sufficient doses to curb the spread of the virus outside the affected area thus adif technologies are applicable to novel or engineered viruses or emerging infections whether natural or manmade this technology may have significant applications in the biodefense area we believe that this is the only technology that can enable humans to combat novel viruses before they spread disease we have already successfully demonstrated the adif technology capabilities     quick links about us board of directors executive officers other officers scientific advisory board
