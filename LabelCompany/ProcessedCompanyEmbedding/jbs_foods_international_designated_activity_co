financial measures we have disclosed our historical ebitda and adjusted ebitda in this prospectus which are nonifrs financial measures see “summary historical and pro forma financial data” and “selected historical financial data” ebitda and adjusted ebitda are used as measures of performance by our management they should not be considered as measures of financial performance in accordance with ifrs   viii table of contents we calculate ebitda as net income plus income taxes finance expense income net and depreciation and amortization including amortization of biological assets we calculate adjusted ebitda as ebitda minus share of profit of equity—accounted investees net of tax plus bargain purchase gain indemnity reorganization and restructuring expenses and other nonrecurring items net and nonrecurring tax contingencies the use of ebitda and adjusted ebitda instead of net income has limitations as an analytical tool including the following     •   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs     •   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt     •   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay taxes     •   although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements     •   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments and     •   ebitda and adjusted ebitda include adjustments that represented a cash expense or that represented a noncash charge that may relate to a future cash expense and some of these expenses are of a type that we expect to incur in the future although we cannot predict the amount of any such future charge ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as alternatives to net income or operating cash flow nor should they be considered as liquidity measurements since they do not reflect certain costs involved in our operations such as finance expenses taxes depreciation capital expenses and other related costs any of which may have a significant effect on our net income we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful tools for assessing financial performance but are not reliable indicators of our ability to generate cash to service debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income loss to determine ebitda and adjusted ebitda involve outlays of cash as a result actual cash available to service debt obligations will be different from ebitda and adjusted ebitda you should rely primarily on our ifrs results and use ebitda and adjusted ebitda in a supplemental manner there is no standard definition of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and our definitions may not be comparable to ebitda or adjusted ebitda as used by other companies market share and other information we obtained the statistical data and information relating to the markets where we operate from reports prepared by government agencies and other publiclyavailable sources although we believe that these sources are reliable we have not performed any independent verification with respect to such statistical data and information and therefore we cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness nothing in this prospectus should be

international ordinary shares after the distribution date q when is the transaction expected to be completed a jbs foods international expects to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter of  q will the transaction affect the trading price of my jbs sa common shares a we expect the trading price of jbs sa common shares immediately following the distribution to be lower than immediately prior to the distribution because the trading price will no longer reflect the value of jbs sa and its subsidiaries other than the assets related to jbs sa’s brazilian beef business and related activities including its leather business furthermore until the market has fully analyzed the value of jbs sa without all of its historical businesses other than jbs sa’s brazilian beef business and related activities including its leather business the trading price of jbs sa common shares may fluctuate significantly we cannot assure you that following the transaction the combined trading prices of jbs sa common shares and jbs foods international ordinary shares will equal or exceed what the trading price of jbs sa common shares would have been in the absence of the transaction it is possible that

factors as a shareholder of jbs foods international following the completion of the transaction you will be subject to all risks inherent in the business of jbs foods international in addition to the risks relating to jbs sa the market value of your jbs foods international ordinary shares and jbs sa common shares will reflect the performance of each business relative to among other things their competitors and general economic market and industry conditions you should carefully consider the following factors as well as the other information contained in this prospectus risks relating to the distribution and ownership of the jbs foods international ordinary shares following the distribution the jbs sa common shares may become less liquid we expect that the liquidity of the market for the remaining jbs sa common shares after the completion of the distribution will be reduced when there is little or no active trading market for securities it can become more difficult to sell the securities in a timely manner at or near their perceived value in such a market the value of such securities may fall accordingly following the distribution the liquidity of the market for the jbs sa common shares and the price per jbs sa common share could be adversely affected following the distribution jbs foods international will become a us public reporting company subject to us financial reporting rules and regulations and other requirements of the sec our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet these requirements which may strain our resources following the distribution jbs foods international will become a public reporting company in the united states and will be subject to reporting disclosure control and other applicable obligations under the us securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act or sox and the doddfrank act as well as rules adopted and to be adopted by the sec and the nyse as a result we will incur higher legal accounting and other expenses than before and these expenses may increase even more in the future for example section  of sox requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments subject to phasein accommodations for newly listed companies our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives which we are in the process of developing and implementing while at the same time remaining focused on our existing operations if we are unable to implement our compliance initiatives in a timely and effective fashion our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired in addition we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our cash flows results of operations or financial condition if we are unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports the market price of the jbs foods international ordinary shares could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies in the united states could also restrict our future access to capital markets and reduce or eliminate the trading market for our ordinary shares    table of contents the distribution could result in substantial us tax liability for you us holders as defined in “taxation—material us federal income tax consequences” of jbs sa shares are not expected to recognize any gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the distribution except for any gain or loss attributable to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of jbs foods international ordinary shares however there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully assert that the distribution is a taxable transaction and that a court will not sustain such assertion which could result in tax being incurred by us holders of jbs sa shares upon receipt of the jbs foods international ordinary shares pursuant to the distribution see “taxation—material us federal income tax consequences” for more information regarding the potential tax consequences to you of the distribution including the tax consequences if the distribution were to be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes the distribution could result in substantial brazilian tax liability for you you may be required to pay brazilian capital gains or other taxes in connection with the receipt of jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs in the distribution see “taxation—material brazilian tax consequences—material brazilian tax consequences on distribution of jbs foods international bdrs or jbs foods international ordinary shares” for more information regarding the potential brazilian tax consequences to you of the distribution following the completion of the distribution a future transfer of your jbs foods international ordinary shares other than by means of the transfer of bookentry interests in the depository trust company or dtc or by way of transfer of bdrs representing bookentry interests in jbs foods international ordinary shares held through dtc may be subject to irish stamp duty jbs foods international has applied to the irish revenue commissioners for confirmation in respect of the stamp duty treatment of certain aspects of the transaction in particular jbs foods international has sought confirmation that no irish stamp duty will arise on transfers of jbs foods international ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in dtc or by way of the transfer of bdrs representing book entry interests in jbs foods international ordinary shares held through dtc there is no certainty that such confirmation will be obtained from the irish revenue commissioners however irrespective of such confirmation being obtained if you hold your jbs foods international ordinary shares directly rather than either beneficially through dtc or by way of bdrs representing book entry interests in jbs foods international ordinary shares held through dtc any transfer of your jbs foods international ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of  of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your jbs foods international ordinary shares see “taxation—irish tax consequences—stamp duty” the equity values of jbs sa and jbs foods international after the transaction may not accurately reflect the value of the underlying entities and equity values may fluctuate significantly the trading price of jbs sa common shares immediately following the distribution is expected to be lower than immediately prior to the distribution because the trading price will no longer reflect the value of jbs sa and its subsidiaries other than the assets and liabilities related to jbs sa’s brazilian beef business and related activities including its leather business furthermore until the market has fully analyzed the value of jbs sa without all of its historical businesses other than jbs sa’s brazilian beef business and related activities as well as its leather business the trading price of jbs sa common shares may fluctuate significantly we cannot assure you that following the distribution the combined trading prices of jbs sa common shares and jbs foods international ordinary shares will equal or exceed what the trading price of jbs sa common shares    table of contents would have been in the absence of the distribution it is possible that after the distribution the combined equity value of jbs sa and jbs foods international will be less than jbs sa’s equity value before the distribution we may not realize the potential benefits from the transaction we may not realize the potential benefits that we expect from the transaction which we have described elsewhere in this prospectus for more information about our rationale for the transaction see “the transaction—rationale for the transaction” we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop or be sustained for the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs you will receive or that we will be able to maintain our listing on the nyse or the bmfbovespa the trading volume of the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs may be volatile and holders of our ordinary shares or bdrs may not be able to sell their shares or bdrs following the distribution jbs foods international does not have any class of securities publicly traded or listed in the united states the listing of shares on the nyse does not assure that a market for the jbs foods international ordinary shares will develop or be sustained or that we will be able to maintain our listing on the nyse or the bmfbovespa no assurance can be provided as to the demand for or trading price of the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs following the completion of the distribution and the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs may trade at a price less than the current market price of jbs sa common shares the trading price of and demand for the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs following completion of the distribution and the development and continued existence of a market and favorable price for the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs will depend on a number of conditions including     •   the risk factors described in this prospectus     •   general economic conditions internationally and within the markets in which we operate including changes in interest and exchange rates     •   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of our competitors     •   our businesses operations results and prospects     •   future mergers and strategic alliances     •   market conditions in the animal protein industry     •   changes in government regulation taxes legal proceedings or other developments     •   shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts     •   investor sentiment toward the stock of animal protein companies in general     •   announcements concerning us or our competitors     •   maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality and     •   the general state of the securities markets these and other factors may impair the development or sustainability of a liquid market for the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs and the ability of investors to sell their jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs at an attractive price these factors also could cause the market price and demand for the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs to fluctuate substantially which may negatively affect the price and liquidity of the jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs many of these factors and conditions are beyond our or our shareholders’ control    table of contents jbs foods international may issue additional ordinary shares in the future as a result of which your investment may be diluted jbs foods international may also issue securities that have rights and privileges that are more favorable than the rights and privileges accorded to you certain statutory preemption rights apply automatically in favor of jbs foods international’s shareholders where shares in jbs foods international are to be issued for cash however jbs foods international has opted out of these preemption rights in its articles of association as permitted under irish company law us holders of jbs foods international ordinary shares may not be able to exercise such subscription rights for new ordinary shares unless a registration statement under the securities act is effective with respect to such rights and new ordinary shares or an exemption from the registration requirements is available jbs foods international’s decision to file a registration statement will depend on the costs and potential liabilities associated with any such registration statement the perceived benefits to jbs foods international of enabling us holders of jbs foods international to exercise their subscription rights and any other facts which jbs foods international considers appropriate at the time for example immediately following the distribution each of fb bndespar and banco original will be entitled to participate in the jbs foods international capital increase through the affiliate private capital contribution pursuant to which they may contribute all or a portion of their jbs sa common shares in consideration for the option to receive additional jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs the other shareholders of jbs foods international however will not be entitled to participate in the jbs foods international capital increase under the same conditions as fb bndespar and banco original instead jbs foods international will make an offer to the holders of jbs sa common shares including those jbs sa common shares represented by jbs sa adss at the same exchange ratio applicable to the affiliate private capital contribution but subject to proration that would allow jbs sa to maintain a minimum free float of at least  of its issued and outstanding jbs sa common shares as required by the listing rules of the novo mercado segment of the bmfbovespa in order to maintain jbs sa’s listing on the novo mercado for more information about the jbs foods international capital increase see “the transaction—following the distribution—the jbs foods international capital increase” to the extent that you are not able or choose not to exercise subscription rights granted in connection with an issue of jbs foods international ordinary shares your proportional shareholding in jbs foods international would be diluted in addition the articles of association of jbs foods international permit the directors of jbs foods international to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval and to determine the terms of such preferred shares which may be more favorable than the terms of its ordinary shares the grant of registration rights to bndespar may adversely affect the market price of the jbs foods international ordinary shares pursuant to a registration rights agreement that is expected to be entered into with bndespar concurrently with the distribution of the jbs foods international ordinary shares bndespar will be able to demand that we register the jbs foods international ordinary shares including those jbs foods international ordinary shares underlying jbs foods international bdrs that bndespar will receive in the distribution and the jbs foods international capital increase we will bear the cost of registering these ordinary shares the registration and availability of such a significant number of shares for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of the jbs foods international ordinary shares including those jbs foods international ordinary shares underlying jbs foods international bdrs for more information about bndes’ registration rights agreement see “principal shareholders—registration rights agreement with bndes”    table of contents fb and bndespar are expected to have influence over the conduct of our business and their respective interests may differ from each other and may also differ from the interests of other shareholders upon completion of the distribution fb and bndespar will collectively own up to approximately  of the jbs foods international ordinary shares including ordinary shares represented by jbs foods international bdrs the batista family through various intermediate holding companies controls jf which in turn owns  of the common shares of fb see “principal shareholders” members of the batista family may also serve on the board of directors of jbs foods international and are officers of jbs foods international see “management” we expect that the board of directors of jbs foods international will be composed of nine directors two of which will be appointed by fb and one of which may be appointed by bndespar we expect fb and bndespar to exercise influence over the conduct of jbs foods international’s business through their representation on jbs foods international’s board of directors since the board of directors will be composed of nine directors upon completion of the transaction neither fb nor bndespar acting individually will be in a position to control positively or negatively decisions of the board of directors that are subject to simple majority approval the respective interests of fb and bndespar may differ from your interests as a result of their influence on jbs foods international’s business fb and bndespar could prevent jbs foods international from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would protect your interests or which would otherwise benefit jbs foods international if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or our businesses the price and trading volume of the jbs foods international ordinary shares could decline the trading market for the jbs foods international ordinary shares will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our businesses while securities and industry analysts currently cover jbs sa securities and industry analysts do not currently cover jbs foods international and may never publish research on us if no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of jbs foods international the trading price for the jbs foods international ordinary shares would likely be negatively impacted in the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our businesses the price of the jbs foods international ordinary shares would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for the jbs foods international ordinary shares could decrease which might cause the price and trading volume of the jbs foods international ordinary shares to decline there is no guarantee that the jbs foods international ordinary shares will be included in market indices such as the sp  there can be no assurance that the jbs foods international ordinary shares will be listed in market indices such as the sp  for example for jbs foods international ordinary shares to be included in the sp  current sp rules would require greater than  of jbs foods international ordinary shares including the jbs foods international ordinary shares represented by jbs foods international bdrs to be held by certain unaffiliated shareholders fb and bndespar would not be considered to be unaffiliated shareholders for this purpose and after the consummation of the transaction will own up to  and  respectively of the total issued jbs foods international ordinary shares including the jbs foods international ordinary shares represented by jbs foods international bdrs in that situation jbs foods international ordinary shares would not be eligible for inclusion in the sp  unless and until it would effect a further issuance of jbs foods international ordinary shares or fb and bndespar reduce their respective shareholdings    table of contents furthermore the earliest that the sp will consider jbs foods international for inclusion in the sp  is six to twelve months after its initial listing on the nyse the sp exercises an element of discretion in determining whether a company is eligible for inclusion and such discretion relates to matters outside of jbs foods international’s control such as measures of liquidity in its stock and the sector balance within the sp  index there is no certainty that the sp  eligibility criteria will be achieved or that the benefits associated with inclusion in the sp  will be available to jbs foods international even if jbs foods international ordinary shares are ultimately included in the sp  there is no assurance that the sp will not publish new guidance in the future regarding nonus incorporated companies or other discretionary factors which could effectively remove jbs foods international ordinary shares from the sp  any shareholder whose principal currency is not the us dollar will be subject to exchange rate fluctuations the jbs foods international ordinary shares will be traded in and any cash dividends or other distributions to be declared in respect of them if any will be denominated in us dollars shareholders whose principal currency is not the us dollar will be exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk any depreciation of the us dollar in relation to such foreign currency would reduce the value of the jbs foods international ordinary shares held by such shareholders whereas any appreciation of the us dollar would increase their value in foreign currency terms in addition we will not offer our shareholders the option to elect to receive dividends if any in any other currency consequently our shareholders may be required to arrange their own foreign currency exchange either through a brokerage house or otherwise which could incur additional commissions or expenses as a holding company jbs foods international’s operating results financial condition and ability to pay dividends or other distributions are entirely dependent on dividends and other distributions received from its subsidiaries as a holding company jbs foods international’s operating results and financial condition are entirely dependent on the performance of its operating subsidiaries additionally jbs foods international’s ability to pay dividends or other distributions in the future will depend on the level of dividends and other distributions if any received from its operating subsidiaries the ability of jbs foods international’s operating companies to make loans or distributions directly or indirectly to jbs foods international’s may from time to time be restricted as a result of several factors including restrictions in financing agreements capital controls or other foreign exchange limitations the requirements of applicable law and regulatory and fiscal or other restrictions including for example the application of a dividend withholding tax and the ability to use any double tax treaty to mitigate such tax in the jurisdictions in which jbs foods international’s subsidiaries operate or if such operating subsidiaries were unable to make loans or distributions to jbs foods international either directly or indirectly if earnings and cash flow from operating subsidiaries were substantially reduced for a sufficient length of time jbs foods international may not be in a position in the longer term to make distributions to holders of the jbs foods international ordinary shares in line with any future announced proposals or at all our dividend policy is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our debt agreements and limitations under irish law which differs from brazilian law including the required court approval of the jbs foods international reduction of capital although we currently expect to pay a regular annual dividend following the closing of the transaction any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial condition earnings legal requirements including limitations under irish law restrictions in our debt agreements that limit our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and other factors the board of directors deems relevant for example the indentures governing our notes restrict our ability to make certain restricted payments including paying dividends unless there is sufficient restricted payment capacity to pay dividends or we rely on a permitted exception if we comply with the net debt to ebitda ratio set forth in the restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing our notes we will be able    table of contents to make restricted payments as long as the aggregate amount of the payments does not exceed the sum of  of net income for the applicable period net cash proceeds from new equity issuances cash received from investments and dividends received from a subsidiary that is not subject to the covenants our board of directors may in its sole discretion change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely for these reasons you will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on your investment accordingly realization of a gain on the jbs foods international ordinary shares you receive in the distribution may depend on the appreciation of the price of our ordinary shares which appreciation may never occur moreover any determination to pay dividends in the future would be subject to compliance with applicable laws including the irish companies act  or the irish companies act the irish companies act among other requirements requires irish companies to have distributable reserves equal to or greater than the amount of the proposed dividend unless jbs foods international creates sufficient distributable reserves from its business activities the creation of such distributable reserves would involve a reduction of jbs foods international’s share premium account which would require the approval of the irish high court we may seek to create such distributable reserves by undertaking the jbs foods international reduction of capital and should we do so we are not aware of any reason why the irish high court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves in this manner however the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the irish high court in the event that we do not undertake the jbs reduction of capital to create distributable reserves no distributions by way of dividends share repurchases or otherwise will be permitted under irish law until such time as jbs foods international has created sufficient distributable reserves from its business activities your rights as a shareholder of jbs foods international will be governed by irish law and differ from the rights of shareholders under us law as of the date of this prospectus jbs foods international is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of ireland therefore the rights of holders of ordinary shares are governed by irish law and by its memorandum and articles of association these rights differ from the typical rights of shareholders in us and brazilian corporations in certain cases facts that under us law would entitle a shareholder in a us corporation to claim damages may not give rise to a cause of action under irish law entitling a shareholder in an irish company to claim damages for example the rights of shareholders to bring proceedings against jbs foods international or against its directors or officers in relation to public statements are more limited under irish law than under the civil liability provisions of the us securities laws you may have difficulties enforcing in actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states judgments obtained in the us courts under the us securities laws in particular if you sought to bring proceedings in ireland based on us securities laws the irish court might consider that     •   it did not have jurisdiction     •   it was not the appropriate forum for such proceedings     •   applying irish conflict of laws rules us laws including us securities laws did not apply to the relationship between you and us or our directors and officers or     •   the us securities laws were of a penal nature or violated irish public policy and should not be enforced by the irish court you should also be aware that irish law does not allow for any form of legal proceedings directly equivalent to the class action available in the united states for further information with respect to your rights as a holder of our ordinary shares see the section of this prospectus titled “description of share capital”    table of contents antitakeover provisions in jbs foods international’s memorandum and articles of association could deter potential acquirers and make an acquisition of us difficult limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current directors and management team and limit the market price of our ordinary shares our memorandum and articles of association contain provisions that although do not make us immune from takeovers may delay or prevent a change of control discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our ordinary shares and adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares these provisions include     •   dividing our board of directors into three classes with each class serving a staggered threeyear term     •   permitting our board of directors to issue preference shares without shareholder approval with such rights preferences and privileges as they may designate     •   provisions which allow our board of directors to adopt plans to allow our shareholders to subscribe for new shares upon such terms and conditions as our board of directors deems expedient and in our best interests     •   establishing an advance notice procedure for shareholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors     •   the ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board and     •   imposing particular approval and other requirements in relation to certain business combinations acquisitions of shares above certain thresholds and purchases by jbs foods international of its own shares in certain circumstances these provisions may be applied even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders in addition these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management team by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors which is responsible for appointing the members of our management irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states with respect to defending unwanted takeover proposals and once our board of directors has received an offer or believes an offer may be imminent may give our board of directors less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors we are subject to the irish takeover rules under the irish takeover rules once our board of directors has received an approach that may lead to an offer or has reason to believe that such an offer is or may be imminent our board of directors is not permitted to take any action that might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares subject to certain exceptions potentially frustrating actions such as     •   the issuance of shares options restricted share units or convertible securities     •   material acquisitions or disposals     •   entering into contracts other than in the ordinary course of business or     •   any action other than seeking alternative offers which may result in frustration of an offer are prohibited during the course of an offer or at any earlier time during which our board of directors has reason to believe an offer is or may be imminent these provisions may give our board of directors less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors than would be the case for a corporation incorporated in the united states we discuss these differences in the section titled “description of share capital”    table of contents we are a “foreign private issuer” under us securities laws and as a result are subject to disclosure obligations that are different from those applicable to us domestic registrants listed on the nyse we are incorporated under the laws of ireland and as such will be considered a “foreign private issuer” under us securities laws although we will be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act the periodic disclosure required of foreign private issuers under the exchange act is different from the periodic disclosure required of us domestic registrants therefore there may be less publicly available information about us than is regularly published by or about other public companies in the united states we are also exempt from certain other sections of the exchange act that us domestic registrants are otherwise subject to including the requirement to provide our shareholders with information statements or proxy statements that comply with the exchange act moreover we are not required to comply with regulation fd which restricts the selective disclosure of material information these exemptions and leniencies may reduce the frequency and scope of information and protections to which you may otherwise have been eligible in you held ordinary shares or common stock of a domestic us issuer in addition insiders and large shareholders of ours will be exempt from the reporting and shortswing profit recovery provisions contained in section  of the exchange act and will not be obligated to file the reports required by section  of the exchange act we would lose our foreign private issuer status if a majority of our shares became held by us persons and a majority of our directors or executive officers are us citizens or residents and we fail to meet additional requirements necessary to avoid loss of foreign private issuer status the regulatory and compliance costs to us under us securities laws as a us domestic issuer may be significantly higher if we are not a foreign private issuer we will be required to file periodic reports and registration statements on us domestic issuer forms with the sec which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer and to prepare our financial statements under us generally accepted accounting principles to the extent we had not already done so we may also be required to modify certain of our policies to comply with accepted governance practices associated with us domestic issuers and may lose our ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements on the nyse that are available to foreign private issuers as a foreign private issuer we may in the future follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of otherwise applicable nyse corporate governance requirements and this may result in less investor protection than that accorded to investors under rules applicable to domestic noncontrolled us issuers as a foreign private issuer we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of those otherwise required under the nyse’s rules for domestic us issuers provided that we disclose which requirements we are not following and describe the equivalent home country requirement for example foreign private issuers are permitted to follow home country practice with regard to director nomination procedures and the approval of compensation of officers additionally we are not required to maintain a board comprised of a majority of independent directors although we intend to do so availing ourselves of any of these exemptions as opposed to complying with the requirements that are applicable to a us domestic registrant may provide less protection to you than is accorded to investors under the nyse’s corporate governance rules therefore any foreign private issuer exemptions we avail ourselves of in the future may reduce the scope of information and protection to which you are otherwise entitled as an investor    table of contents risks relating to our business and industries our results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in market prices for livestock and animal feed ingredients our operating margins depend on among other factors the purchase price of raw materials primarily livestock and animal feed ingredients and the sales price of our products these prices may vary significantly including during short periods of time due to a number of factors including the beef pork and poultry supply and demand and the market of other protein products raw materials accounted for  and  of the total cost of products sold during the threemonth periods ended march   and  respectively raw materials accounted for  of the total cost of products sold during the years ended december   and  the supply and market for livestock depend on a number of factors that we have little or no control over including outbreaks of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly referred to as mad cow disease or bse and foot and mouth disease or fmd the cost of animal feeding economic and weather conditions livestock prices demonstrate a cyclical nature both seasonally and over longer periods reflecting the supply of and demand for livestock on the market and the market for other protein products such as fish these costs are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which we have little or no control these other factors include     •   import and export restrictions     •   changing livestock and grain inventory levels     •   economic conditions     •   crop and livestock diseases and     •   environmental and conservation regulations we do not generally enter into longterm sales arrangements with our customers with fixed price contracts and as a result the prices at which we sell our products are determined in large part by market conditions a majority of our livestock is purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market a significant decrease in beef pork or chicken prices for a sustained period of time could have a material adverse effect on our net revenue also a portion of our forward purchase and sale contracts are markedtomarket such that the related unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings on a quarterly basis therefore losses on those contracts would adversely affect our earnings and may cause significant volatility in our quarterly earnings profitability in the processing industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of animal feed ingredients such as grain corn and soybeans the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments and weather patterns throughout the world market prices for feed ingredients remain volatile high prices for animal feed ingredients may have a material adverse effect on our operating results accordingly we may be unable to pass on all or part of any increased costs we experience from time to time to consumers of our products directly in a timely manner or at all additionally if we do not attract and maintain contracts or marketing relationships with independent producers and growers our production operations could be disrupted adversely affecting us outbreaks of livestock diseases may affect our ability to conduct our business and harm demand for our products outbreaks of diseases affecting livestock such as bse fmd and various strains of influenza which may be caused by factors beyond our control or concerns that these diseases may occur and spread in the future could lead to cancellation of orders by our customers or governmental restrictions on the import and export of our    table of contents products to or from our suppliers facilities or customers moreover outbreaks of livestock diseases could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to among other things destroy any affected livestock and create negative publicity that may have a material adverse effect on customer demand for our products in addition if the products of our competitors become contaminated the adverse publicity associated with such an event may lower consumer demand for our products any perceived or real health risks related to the food industry could adversely affect our ability to sell our products if our products become contaminated we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally including risks posed by the following     •   food spoilage or food contamination     •   consumer product liability claims     •   product tampering     •   the possible unavailability and expense of product liability insurance and     •   the potential cost and disruption of a product recall our products have in the past been and may in the future be exposed to contamination by organisms that may produce food borne illnesses such as e coli listeria monocytogenes and salmonella these organisms are generally found in the environment and as a result there is a risk that they could be present in our products these pathogens can also be introduced to our products through tampering or as a result of improper handling at the further processing foodservice or consumer level once contaminated products have been shipped for distribution illness or death may result if the products are not properly prepared prior to consumption or if the pathogens are not eliminated in further processing our systems designed to monitor food safety risks throughout all stages of our processes may not eliminate the risks related to food safety as a result we may voluntarily recall or be required to recall our products if they are or may be contaminated spoiled or inappropriately labeled we may be subject to significant liability in the jurisdictions in which our products are sold if the consumption of any of our products causes injury illness or death such liability may result from proceedings filed by the government’s attorney’s office consumer agencies and individual consumers we may have to pay significant damages to consumers or to the government and such liability may be in excess of applicable liability insurance policy limits adverse publicity concerning any perceived or real health risk associated with our products could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products we could also be adversely affected by perceived or real health risks associated with similar products produced by others to the extent such risks cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of such products generally changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our business the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends demands and preferences our products compete with other protein sources such as fish trends within the food industry frequently change and our failure to anticipate identify or react to changes in these trends could lead to reduced demand and prices for our products among other concerns and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations    table of contents we face competition in our business which may adversely affect our market share and profitability the beef pork and chicken industries are highly competitive competition exists both in the purchase of live cattle and hogs and grains and in the sale of beef pork and chicken products in addition our beef pork and chicken products compete with other protein sources such as fish we face competition from a number of beef pork and chicken producers in the countries in which we operate the principal competitive factors in the animal protein processing industries are operating efficiency and the availability quality and cost of raw materials and labor price quality food safety product distribution technological innovations and brand loyalty our ability to be an effective competitor depends on our ability to compete on the basis of these characteristics in addition some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than us we may be unable to compete effectively with these companies and if we are unable to remain competitive with these beef pork and poultry producers in the future our market share may be adversely affected our growth organic and inorganic may require substantial capital and longterm investments our competitiveness and growth depend on our ability to fund our capital expenditures we cannot assure you that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures at reasonable costs due to adverse macroeconomic conditions our performance or other external factors we may pursue additional opportunities to acquire complementary businesses which could further increase leverage and debt service requirements and could adversely affect our financial situation if we fail to successfully integrate the acquired business we intend to continue to pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future inherent in any future acquisitions are certain risks such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results particularly during the period immediately following such acquisitions additional debt or equity capital may be required to complete future acquisitions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the required capital furthermore acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges including     •   diversion of management’s attention     •   potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies     •   an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements     •   failure of the acquired entities to achieve expected results     •   our failure to successfully integrate any acquired entities into our business and     •   our inability to achieve expected synergies andor economies of scale these opportunities may also expose us to successor liability relating to actions involving any acquired entities their respective management or contingent liabilities incurred prior to our involvement and will expose us to liabilities associated with ongoing operations in particular to the extent we are unable to adequately and safely manage such acquired operations these transactions may also be structured in such a manner that would result in our assumption of obligations or liabilities not identified during our preacquisition due diligence any of these and other factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated cash flows at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions which could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on us    table of contents our indebtedness could adversely affect our business as of march   we had total outstanding consolidated debt of r million us million of which r million us million was classified as current loans and financing if we are unable to repay or refinance our short or longterm debt as it matures this would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our consolidated indebtedness may     •   make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations including making interest payments on debt obligations     •   limit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business     •   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to serve our debt reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements     •   limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate     •   place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to some of our competitors that have less debt than us     •   make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates resulting in higher interest costs in respect of our floating rate debt and     •   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including changes in interest rates lower cattle and hog prices or a downturn in our business or the economy in addition any business that we acquire by borrowing additional funds may increase our leverage and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations limit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to some of our competitors that have less debt than us covenant restrictions under debt agreements limit our ability to operate our business our debt agreements contain among other things covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities such debt agreements restrict among other things our ability to     •   incur additional indebtedness     •   create liens on or sell our assets     •   pay dividends on or redeem capital stock     •   make restricted payments     •   create or permit restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions     •   enter into transactions with affiliates and     •   engage in mergers consolidations and certain dispositions of assets in addition certain of our credit facilities require us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios and tests which may require that we or they take action to reduce debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives events beyond our control including changes in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests    table of contents we may not meet those ratios and tests and our creditors may not waive any failure to meet those ratios and tests a breach of any of these covenants or failure to maintain these ratios would result in an event of default under the relevant credit facility and any such event of default or resulting acceleration under such credit facility could result in an event of default under other debt agreements we are subject to interest rate fluctuations which may be harmful to our business as of march    of our loans and financing in the amount of r million us million was subject to interest rate fluctuations including fluctuations in  brazilian financial market rates or inflation rates such as the interbank deposit certificate certificado de depósito interbancário or the brazilian cdi rate and the longterm interest rate taxa de juros de longo prazo or the brazilian tjlp rate brazil’s longterm interest rate published quarterly by the brazilian national monetary council and  nonbrazilian financial market rate such as the london interbank offered rate or libor and the euro interbank offered rate or euribor fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates are caused by a number of factors that are beyond our control if exchange rates or interest rates such as the brazilian cdi brazilian tjlp libor or euribor rates increase significantly our finance expenses will increase and our ability to obtain financings may decrease which may materially adversely affect our results of operations our business may be adversely impacted by risks related to hedging activities we may enter into hedging transactions including exchange rate and commodities transactions that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions we are exposed to potential changes in the value of our derivative instruments primarily caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodities prices these fluctuations may result from changes in economic conditions investor sentiment monetary and fiscal policies the liquidity of global markets international and regional political events and acts of war or terrorism unfavorable decisions in legal administrative or arbitration proceedings may adversely affect us we are defendants in legal administrative and arbitration proceedings arising from the ordinary conduct of our business especially with respect to civil tax labor and environmental claims which may be decided to our detriment adverse rulings that have material economic impacts on our business or impede the execution of our growth plan may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for some of these lawsuits we were not required to and have not established any provision on our statement of financial position or have established provisions only for part of the amounts in dispute based on our judgments or opinions of our legal counsel as to the likelihood of winning these lawsuits for more information regarding our proceedings see “business—legal proceedings” we may not be able to ensure that our raw material suppliers are in compliance with all applicable environmental and labor laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the raising of cattle and other livestock is at times associated with deforestation invasion of indigenous lands and protected areas and other environmental and human rights concerns most of the cattle we process are raised by our suppliers we aim to ensure that cattle are sourced from responsible suppliers and rely on suppliers to comply with applicable laws in brazil we have a system in place to monitor our cattle suppliers using satellite images georeferenced maps of farms deforestation data and data from government agencies regarding embargoed areas the purpose of this system is to identify and block suppliers that are not in compliance with environmental regulations if we are unable to ensure that the suppliers of the cattle we use in our production process are in compliance with all applicable environmental and human rights laws and regulations we may be subject to fines and other penalties that may adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations    table of contents we are subject to various risks relating to worker safety given the nature of our operations we are subject to various risks relating to worker safety we conduct training and educational campaigns to improve awareness of risks and safety in the work environment and strive to improve safety conditions in the workplace but cannot ensure that accidents will not occur if our efforts to improve worker safety and reduce the frequency and number of workplace accidents are not successful our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected we depend on our information technology systems and any failure of these systems could adversely affect our business we depend on information technology systems for significant elements of our operations including the storage of data and retrieval of critical business information our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including network failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security and backup measures some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems failures or significant disruptions to our information technology systems or those used by our thirdparty service providers could prevent us from conducting our general business operations any disruption or loss of information technology systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition further we store highly confidential information on our information technology systems including information related to our products if our servers or the servers of the third party on which our data is stored are attacked by a physical or electronic breakin computer virus or other malicious human action our confidential information could be stolen or destroyed any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information of our suppliers customers or others whether by us or a third party could  subject us to civil and criminal penalties  have a negative impact on our reputation or  expose us to liability to our suppliers customers other third parties or government authorities any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations the loss of members of our senior management or our inability to attract and retain qualified senior management personnel could have an adverse effect on us our ability to maintain our competitive position depends in large part on the performance of our senior management team mainly because of our business model and our acquisition strategy as a result of factors such as improving economic conditions in the ireland the united kingdom the united states brazil and elsewhere we may lose key employees or face problems hiring qualified key employees in order to retain key employees we may have to make significant changes in our compensation policy to remain competitive which would increase our costs there is no assurance that we will succeed in attracting and retaining qualified senior management personnel the loss of the services of any member of our senior management or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us our performance depends on favorable labor relations with our employees and our compliance with labor laws any deterioration of those relations or increase in labor costs could adversely affect our business as of march   we had approximately  employees worldwide a majority of these employees are represented by labor organizations and our relationships with these employees are governed by collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements or other labor agreements we may not reach new agreements without union action and any such new agreements may not be on terms satisfactory to us in addition any new agreements may be for shorter durations than our historical agreements moreover additional groups of currently nonunionized employees may seek union representation in the future if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements we may become subject to unioninitiated work stoppages including strikes any significant increase in labor costs deterioration of    table of contents employee relations slowdowns or work stoppages at any of our locations whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for more information about the labor claims and proceedings to which we are a party see “business—legal proceedings” the consolidation of our customers could adversely affect our business our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products if we fail to respond to these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products any of which would adversely affect our financial results risks relating to the markets in which we operate deterioration of global economic conditions could adversely affect our business our business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions including changes in gdp inflation interest rates availability of capital consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions any such changes could adversely affect the demand for products both in domestic and international markets or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials cooking ingredients and packaging materials thereby adversely affecting our financial results disruptions in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of global economic conditions could among other things     •   adversely affect global demand for protein products which could result in a reduction of sales operating income and cash flows     •   make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future     •   cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any technical or other waivers under our debt agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future     •   impair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers and     •   decrease the value of our investments our exports are subject to a wide range of political and economic risks exports account for a significant portion of our sales representing  and  of our gross revenue for the threemonth period ended march   and the year ended december   respectively we are subject to risk factors that are outside our control in our principal sales markets including     •   changes in foreign currency exchange rates     •   deterioration of economic conditions     •   imposition of tax increases antidumping tariffs and other trade andor health barriers     •   exchange controls and restrictions to exchange operations     •   strikes or other events that may affect ports and transportation and     •   compliance with different foreign legal and regulatory regimes and     •   trade barriers    table of contents our future financial performance will depend significantly on economic political and social conditions in our principal sales markets we are exposed to emerging and developing country risks our operations in emerging and developing countries are subject to the customary risks of operating in these countries which include potential political and economic uncertainty government debt crises application of exchange controls reliance on foreign investment nationalization or expropriation crime and lack of law enforcement political insurrection terrorism religious unrest external interference currency fluctuations and changes in government policy in brazil for example the federal government frequently intervenes in the economy and its actions to control inflation and other regulations and policies have often involved among other measures increases in interest rates changes in tax policies price controls currency devaluations capital controls and limits on imports among others due to our exposure in brazil these factors could affect us more than our competitors with less exposure to such emerging and developing countries and any general decline in emerging and developing countries as a whole could impact us disproportionately compared to our competitors such factors could affect our results by causing interruptions to operations by increasing the costs of operating in those countries or by limiting the ability to repatriate profits from those countries these circumstances could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition our businesses are subject to government policies and extensive regulations affecting the beef pork and poultry industries livestock production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations government policies affecting the livestock industry such as taxes tariffs duties subsidies and import and export restrictions on livestock products can influence industry profitability the use of land resources the location and size of livestock production whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded and the volume and types of imports and exports our plants and products are subject to periodic inspections by federal state and municipal authorities and to comprehensive food regulation including controls over processed food our operations are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state local and foreign authorities regarding the processing packaging storage distribution advertising and labeling of its products including food safety standards our exported products are often inspected by foreign food safety authorities and any violation discovered during these inspections may result in a partial or total return of a shipment partial or total destruction of the shipment and costs due to delays in product deliveries to our customers government policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the supply of demand for and prices of livestock products restrict our ability to do business in existing and target domestic and export markets and could adversely affect our results of operations for example in august  russia banned the importation of chicken and other agricultural products from the us and certain other western countries in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the us and europe on russia over its actions in ukraine in addition if we are required to comply with future material changes in food safety regulations we could be subject to material increases in operating costs and we could be required to implement regulatory changes on schedules that may require us to interrupt our operations the volatility of the real against the us dollar the euro and other currencies may have a material adverse effect on us and the market price of the notes the brazilian currency has during past decades experienced frequent and substantial variations in relation to the us dollar and other foreign currencies in the past the brazilian government has implemented various economic plans and exchange rate policies including sudden devaluations and periodic minidevaluations    table of contents during which the frequency of adjustments has ranged from daily to monthly floating exchange rate systems exchange controls and dual exchange rate markets there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the brazilian currency and the us dollar the euro and other currencies however during  due to the poor economic conditions in brazil including as a result of political instability the real has devalued at a rate that is much higher than in previous years on september   the real fell to the lowest level since the introduction of the currency at r per us overall in  the real depreciated  reaching r per us on december   in early  the real appreciated against the us dollar primarily as a result of brazil’s changing political conditions whereby markets reacted favorably to the impeachment proceedings against president dilma rousseff and the increased likelihood of a change in the current governing regime on march   and august   the exchange rates were r per us and r per us respectively there can be no assurance that the real will not depreciate or appreciate further against the us dollar the euro and other currencies a significant portion of our indebtedness revenues and some of our operating expenses are and we expect them to continue to be denominated or indexed to the us dollar and other foreign currencies as of march   our indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies was r million any exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations a less favorable exchange rate may effectively increase the borrowing cost of our debt denominated in us dollars and other foreign currencies compliance with existing or changing environmental requirements relating to current andor discontinued operations may result in significant costs and failure to comply may result in civil liabilities for damages as well as criminal and administrative sanctions our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment the handling treatment and disposal of wastes and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination failure to comply with these requirements could have serious consequences for us including criminal as well as civil and administrative penalties claims for property damage personal injury and damage to natural resources and negative publicity our activities may also be affected by future international agreements entered into force to protect the environment as a result of possible new environmental international agreements or other unforeseen events especially if environmental rules and regulations become stricter in the markets in which we operate we may have to incur additional expenses in order to comply with such environmental rules and regulations which may adversely affect our available resources for capital expenditures and other purposes compliance with existing or new environmental rules and regulations may increase our costs and expenses and as a result reduce our profit climate change climate change regulations adverse weather conditions and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases or ghg continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate climate change including the impact of global warming creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events climate change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity natural disasters fire bioterrorism pandemics drought changes in rainfall patterns or extreme weather including floods excessive cold or heat hurricanes or other storms could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages fuel shortages damage to our production and processing plants or disruption of transportation channels among other things any of these factors as well as disruptions in our information systems could have an adverse effect on our financial results    table of contents we are subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change and compliance with related rules could be difficult and costly concerned parties in the countries in which we operate such as government agencies legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions we could incur increased energy environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with existing or new ghg limitations we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change efforts to comply with immigration laws andor the introduction of new immigration legislation could make it more difficult or costly for us to hire employees as well as have a material adverse effect on our operations and subject us to civil or possible criminal penalties immigration reform continues to attract significant attention among the public and governments in the markets in which we operate for example if new immigration legislation is enacted such legislation may contain provisions that could make it more difficult or costly for us to hire legal immigrant workers in such a case we may incur additional labor costs and other costs of doing business which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition despite our efforts to hire only persons legally authorized to work in the jurisdictions in which we operate we are unable to ensure that all of our employees are persons legally authorized to work moreover efforts by governmental authorities in enforcing the law may occur including civil or possible criminal penalties and we may face shortages of personnel or interruptions in our operations in one or more plants resulting in an adverse impact on our business we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act we are subject to a number of anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and the uk bribery act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits some of these laws have legal effect outside the jurisdictions in which they are adopted under certain circumstances for example the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries and agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also requires maintenance of adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect transactions under the fcpa companies operating in the united states may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives the uk bribery act is broader in scope than the fcpa in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the fcpa the uk bribery act also has wide jurisdiction it covers any offense committed in the united kingdom but proceedings can also be brought if a person who has a close connection with the united kingdom commits the relevant acts or omissions outside the united kingdom the uk bribery act defines a person with a close connection to include british citizens individuals ordinarily resident in the united kingdom and bodies incorporated in the united kingdom the uk bribery act also provides that any organization that conducts part of its business in the united kingdom even if it is not incorporated in the united kingdom can be prosecuted for the corporate offense of failing to prevent bribery by an associated person even if the bribery took place entirely outside the united kingdom and the associated person had no connection with the united kingdom other jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted similar anticorruption antibribery and antikickback laws to which we are subject civil and criminal penalties may be imposed for violations of these laws although we expect that our code of ethics and standards of conduct will require our employees to comply with the fcpa uk bribery act and similar laws we have not yet put in place a formal anticorruption    table of contents compliance program or policy that covers our employees and consultants we operate in some countries which are viewed as high risk for anticorruption compliance and despite our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with the fcpa uk bribery act and similar laws there can be no assurance that our employees agents thirdparty intermediaries and the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will comply with the fcpa uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws or the policies that we implement to seek to ensure compliance with such laws for which we may be ultimately held responsible if we are not in compliance with anticorruption laws and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects any investigation of any actual or alleged violations of such laws could also harm our reputation or have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the recent vote by the uk electorate in favor of having the uk exit the european union could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition in a referendum held in the united kingdom on june   a majority of those voting voted for the united kingdom to leave the european union referred to as brexit for now the united kingdom remains a member of the european union and there will not be any immediate change in either european union or uk law as a consequence of the vote european union law does not govern contracts and the united kingdom is not part of the european union’s monetary union however brexit vote signals the beginning of a lengthy process under which the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from and future relationship with the european union will be negotiated and legislation to implement the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union will be enacted the ultimate impact of brexit vote will depend on the terms that are negotiated in relation to the united kingdom’s future relationship with the european union although the timetable for uk withdrawal is not at all clear at this stage it is likely that the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will take more than two years to be negotiated and conclude brexit could impair our ability to transact business in the united kingdom and in countries in the european union brexit has already and could continue to adversely affect european andor worldwide economic and market conditions and could continue to contribute to instability in the global financial markets the longterm effects of brexit will depend in part on any agreements the united kingdom makes to retain access to markets in the european union following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union in addition we expect that brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replicate or replace if the united kingdom were to significantly alter its regulations affecting the food industry we could face significant new costs it may also be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our internal operations in order to comply with new regulations additionally our moy park results of operations may be adversely affected if the united kingdom is unable to secure replacement trade agreements and arrangements on terms as favorable as those currently enjoyed by the united kingdom any of the effects of brexit could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows there are

by any person or legal entity regardless of the amount subject to certain regulatory procedures the rules governing the foreign exchange system were made more flexible in  with respect to the registration of flows of direct investments credits royalties transfers of technology and crossborder leases among others since  the central bank of brazil has allowed the realus dollar exchange rate to float freely and since that time the realus dollar exchange rate has fluctuated considerably in the past the brazilian government has implemented various economic plans and utilized a number of exchange rate policies including sudden devaluation periodic minidevaluation during which the frequency of adjustments ranged from a daily to a monthly basis floating exchange rate systems exchange controls and dual exchange rate markets we cannot predict whether the central bank of brazil or the brazilian government will continue to let the real float freely or intervene in the exchange rate

such modifications materially change the terms and conditions of the distribution jbs sa will notify its shareholders in a manner reasonably calculated to inform them of such modifications with a press release or other similar means reason for this prospectus with respect to the distribution this prospectus is being made available to jbs sa shareholders solely to provide information to jbs sa shareholders who will receive jbs foods international ordinary shares or jbs foods international bdrs in the distribution it is not to be construed as an inducement or encouragement to buy or sell any of our securities we believe that the information contained in this prospectus is accurate as of the date set forth on the cover changes may occur after that date and neither we nor jbs sa undertakes any obligation to update the information except to the extent so required by applicable securities laws    table of contents certain legal and regulatory matters general except as otherwise disclosed in this section jbs foods international is not aware of any other material regulatory approvals or other regulatory actions required for the consummation of the distribution should any such approval or other action be required we currently contemplate that such approval or other action will be sought we are unable to predict whether such approval or other action may determine that we are required to delay the distribution pending the outcome of any such matter there can be no assurance that any such approval or other action if needed would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial conditions or that if such approvals were not obtained or such other actions were not taken adverse consequences might not result to jbs sa’s business or the distribution cvm registration before commencement of the distribution jbs foods international must be registered as a foreign issuer with the cvm and the jbs foods international bdr program must be registered with the cvm bmfbovespa listing in order to have the jbs foods international bdrs admitted to trade on the bmfbovespa jbs foods international must be registered as a foreign issuer on the bmfbovespa and the jbs foods international bdrs must be listed with the bmfbovespa jbs foods international expects to obtain the necessary bmfbovespa registration and listing prior to the distribution accounting treatment in connection with the transaction we will transfer control of all of jbs sa’s businesses other than its brazilian beef business and related activities including its leather business with a corresponding increase in the shareholders’ equity of jbs foods international equal to the predecessor historical cost book value of the net assets transferred the transfer will occur as follows     •   we will conduct a capital increase in jbs foods international through the transfer of substantially all of jbs sa’s assets and certain liabilities other than the assets and certain liabilities of jbs sa associated with its brazilian beef business and related activities including its leather business from jbs sa which will be recorded as a capital reduction in jbs sa     •   we expect that affiliates of jbs sa will convert their jbs sa common shares for jbs foods international ordinary shares at which time jbs foods international will become the new controlling shareholder of jbs sa some shareholders of jbs sa will not be able to exchange all of their jbs sa common shares or jbs sa adss and therefore will remain shareholders in jbs sa thus becoming noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statement of financial position of jbs foods international the net assets transferred will be recorded at their predecessor historical cost basis under ifrs as the net assets were under the control of the ultimate controlling shareholder fb before and after the transaction as the transaction will be under common control it is outside the scope of ifrs  “business combinations” and predecessor accounting will be applied instead of purchase accounting the consolidated net assets of jbs foods international will thus be the same as the consolidated net assets currently recorded in the books of jbs sa noncontrolling interests in the jbs foods international consolidated statement of financial position will be greater than jbs sa because certain noncontrolling shareholders of jbs sa will remain shareholders of jbs sa    table of contents us federal income tax consequences of the distribution you may be required to pay us withholding or other taxes in connection with the jbs

world’s largest protein company in terms of revenue our consolidated net revenue for the threemonth period ended march   and the years ended december   and  was r million us million r million us million and r million us million through strategic acquisitions in new geographies primarily in the united states australia brazil and europe we have created a diversified global platform that allows us to prepare package and deliver fresh processed and valueadded beef poultry pork lamb and sheep products and animal byproducts from our facilities located around the world in  we sold our products in approximately  countries on five continents and for the threemonth period ended march   and the years ended december   and  we generated   and  respectively of our consolidated gross revenue from sales outside of brazil our protein products are recognized through our wellknown brands including “swift” “swift premium” “” “pilgrim’s pride” “pierce” “gold kist farms” and “del dia” in north america “friboi” “seara” “maturatta” and “cabaña las lilas” in south america “primo” and “beehive” in australia and new zealand and “moy park” and “o’kane” in europe we believe that as of march   we

customized manner for specific orders and include frozen cooked canned seasoned marinated and consumerready products in addition we produce and sell animal byproducts that are derived from our beef processing operations such as hides to customers in the shoe clothing and automobile industries among others in brazil we also produce and sell personal hygiene and cleaning products collagen biodiesel fuel and metal cans we sell our products primarily to retailers such as supermarkets club stores and other retail distributors and foodservice companies such as restaurants hotels foodservice distributors and additional processors in the countries where we operate our facilities which we classify as domestic sales and elsewhere which we classify as export sales as of march   we had more than  active customers in our database including retailers and wholesalers critical accounting policies the presentation of our financial condition and results of operation in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb requires that certain judgments and estimates be made regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities significant assets and liabilities that are subject to these estimates include the useful life of the property plant and equipment estimated recovery value of longlived assets allowance for doubtful accounts inventories deferred income tax provision for tax civil and labor liabilities determining the fair value of financial instruments assets and liabilities and other similar estimates regarding the selection of interest rates and valuation of derivative financial instruments the settlement of a transaction involving these estimates may result in values that are different from those estimated due to the possible lack of precision inherent to the process certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application actual results may differ from those estimated depending upon the variables assumptions or conditions used by our management significant accounting policies related to property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill inventory revenue recognition and borrowings are described within the notes to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus in order to provide an understanding regarding how our management forms its judgments about future events including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates and the sensitivity of those judgments to different variables and conditions certain of our critical accounting policies are discussed below business combination goodwill intangible assets and impairment we have made acquisitions that generated a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets with both indefinite and finite lives as described in note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus including the seara acquisition primo acquisition cargill acquisition and moy park acquisition among others as described in note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus according to international financial reporting standards ifrs  “business combinations” the excess of the consideration paid the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree when applicable and the fair value at the acquisition date of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net identifiable asset acquired at that date is recorded as goodwill ifrs  does not permit that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be amortized but they should be tested annually for impairment    table of contents management uses judgment to identify tangible and intangible assets and liabilities valuing such assets and liabilities and in determining their remaining useful lives we generally engage third party valuation firms to assist in valuing the acquired assets and liabilities the valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on the assumptions and criteria which include in some cases estimates of future cash flows discounted at the appropriate rates the use of different assumptions used for valuation purposes including estimates of future cash flows or discount rates may result in different estimates of value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets are tested for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions including revenue growth costs and expenses capital expenditures working capital and discount rates as described in note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material allowance for doubtful accounts we are subject to credit risk related to accounts receivable therefore our management use estimates and judgments in determining the amount that will not be recovered allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on estimated probable losses that were considered sufficient to cover any probable losses on the realization of our accounts receivable we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the collectable amounts in our accounts receivable as the diversity in the portfolio contributes significantly to reduce the credit risk see note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus biological assets management use estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of live assets poultry and hogs relate to market prices average lifecycle growth and laying and reproduction profile market prices for poultry and hogs are based on the group’s knowledge of a limited market for poultry transactions at various points of the consumable and bearer assets’ lifecycle biological assets are described in note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus stockbased compensation we have a stock option plan that is settled with shares as described in note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus the fair value of the share options is estimated at grant date using an option pricing model that is most appropriate for the respective option based on the expected number of options that will be exercised the fair value of the options granted is recognized as an expense over the vesting period with a credit to equity stockbased compensation is described in note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus deferred and current income taxes we recognize deferred tax effects of tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities we estimate our income taxes    table of contents based on regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we record on our statement of financial position a portion of the tax benefit corresponding to the tax losses carried forward was not recorded as an asset as management cannot determine whether realization is probable tax losses and negative bases of social contribution in brazil have no expiration date however the annual offset is limited to  of pretax income we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and will only recognize if we believe that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profit based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at each statement of financial position date we reduce the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilized any such reduction is reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available deferred and current income taxes are describe in note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus provisions for contingencies the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions regarding contingencies which affect the valuation of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues and expenses during the reported period in particular given the uncertain nature of brazilian tax legislation the assessment of potential tax liabilities requires significant management judgment we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to employment environmental product taxing authorities and other matters we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses to these matters provisions for contingencies are recorded when losses are considered to be probable and the amount can be reliably measured no provision is recorded if the risk of loss for a contingency is assessed to be reasonably possible but not probable but reasonably possible losses are disclosed in the notes to jbs sa’s financial statements if the risk of loss for a contingency is assessed as remote no provision or disclosure is necessary we discuss our material contingencies in note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus financial instruments financial instruments are recorded only as of the date we become a party to the relevant instrument the financial asset or liability is initially recorded by its fair value plus any costs of the transaction that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial assets or liability the subsequent measuring of financial instruments occurs as of each reporting date in accordance with the rules set forth depending on the nature of the relevant financial assets and liabilities which are classified as follows  fair value through profit or loss  heldtomaturity  loans and receivables  derivative financial instruments and  other liabilities at amortized costs we have not designated any of our derivatives as cash flow hedges and therefore all fair value adjustments have been recorded in profit and loss for all periods presented see note  to jbs sa’s audited consolidated financial statements as of december   and  and for the years ended december    and  included elsewhere in this prospectus    table of contents the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated foreign currency translation functional and presentation currency the functional currency of a company is the local currency within the primary economic environment in which it operates these consolidated financial statements are presented in brazilian reais r which is jbs sa’s presentation and functional currency all financial information is presented in thousands of reais except when otherwise indicated transactions in foreign currencies other than a company’s functional currency are initially measured in the respective functional currencies of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are remeasured at the closing exchange rate on the statement of financial position foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the remeasurement at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of income under the caption “finance expense” group companies with a different functional currency the financial statements of our subsidiaries located outside brazil are prepared using each subsidiary’s respective functional currency the results and financial position of all entities with a functional currency different from our presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows      assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate at the date of each closing period      income and expenses are translated at the monthly average rate and      all resulting exchange differences are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and are presented in the statement of comprehensive income in foreign currency translation adjustments and in the equity consolidated financial statements we consolidate all majorityowned subsidiaries we control an entity when it is exposed or has the right to variable returns resulting from our involvement with the entity and we have the ability to affect those returns through our power to direct the activities of the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us the consolidation is discontinued from the date that control ceases investments in associates and joint venture “joint ventures” are recorded using the equity method an associate is an entity over which we have significant influence but does not exercise control joint ventures are all entities over which we share control with one or more parties accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with policies adopted by us intercompany transactions balances income and expenses transactions between group companies are eliminated in consolidation the noncontrolling interest represents the portion of consolidated subsidiaries not owned by us and is presented in the financial statements as part of shareholder’s equity as well as the net income loss attributable to them in the statement of income when we acquire or dispose of shares of an entity that we already controls any resulting gains from the different between the amount paid or received and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on a per share basis gains or losses are recorded within the capital reserve a component of shareholders’ equity    table of contents recent accounting pronouncements the following new standards have been issued by iasb but are not effective for  the early adoption of standards is allowed ifrs —“financial instruments” addresses the classification measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities ifrs  addresses the classification measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules for hedge accounting the effective date is january   we are assessing the impacts on the adoption of ifrs  and have not determined the transition method that will be used ifrs —“revenue from contracts with customers” replaces ias  “construction contracts” ias  “revenue” and related interpretations and introduces the principles to be applied by an entity to measure and recognize of revenue the iasb has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue this will replace ias  which covers contracts for goods and services and ias  which covers construction contracts the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when control of a good or service transfers to a customer—so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards the standard permits a modified retrospective approach for the adoption under this approach entities will recognize transitional adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application ie january   ie without restating the comparative period they will only need to apply the new rules to contracts that are not completed as of the date of initial application the effective date is january   we are assessing the impacts on the adoption of ifrs  and have not determined the transition method that will be used ifrs —“leases” supersedes the existing standard on leasing ias —“leases” and related interpretations and establishes the principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure on leasing for both parties to a contract in other words clients lessee and suppliers lessor lessees are required to recognize a leasing liability reflecting future payments of the leasing and a “right to use an asset” for almost all leases contracts excepting some shortterm leases and contracts of assets of a small amount for lessors the accounting treatment remains almost unchanged with the classification of leases in operational or financial leases and the accounting of these two kinds of lease contracts in different manners the standard comes into effect on january   we are assessing the impacts on the adoption of ifrs  and have not defined the transition method that will be used there are no other ifrs or ifric interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on our financial statements description of main statement of income line items net revenue our net revenue revenue after the deductions corresponding to cancellations discounts and sales taxes levied on revenue

hygiene and cleaning products metal packaging and casings and carrier waste management and raw materials trading services in brazil cost of sales a significant portion of our cost of sales consists of the cost of purchasing raw materials we generally purchase livestock and grains in spot market transactions in north america our chicken business is influenced by fluctuations in prices of corn and soy meal which are feed ingredients required for our vertically integrated operations our beef and pork businesses are indirectly influenced by fluctuations in the price of feed ingredients since we do not keep or raise our own cattle and we raise only about  of our hogs instead our beef and pork businesses are more directly affected by fluctuations in the spot market for beef cattle and hogs in brazil our beef operations are impacted primarily by grassfed cattle supply and prices our chicken operations in brazil are impacted by fluctuations in feed ingredients and although these costs are denominated in reais the prices of these commodities tend to follow international prices which in turn are denominated in us dollars and are influenced by exchange rate fluctuations in addition to livestock and feed costs our cost of sales also consists of other production costs including packaging and other raw materials and labor operating expenses our operating expenses consists primarily of     •   general and administrative expenses this line item includes primarily expenses relating to payroll utilities and maintenance of our offices and headquarters     •   selling expenses this line item includes expenses relating to advertising payment of commissions and salaries to members of our sales team and allowances for doubtful accounts     •   finance expense net this line item includes expenses relating to interest incurred on our indebtedness revenue from interest on our investments taxes on our financial income taxes on financial transactions expenses and revenue and expenses from fluctuations of the real against the us dollar and revenue and expenses from derivatives transactions primarily related to our exposure to the us dollar deferred and current income taxes we recognize deferred tax effects of tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities we estimate our income taxes

is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilized any such reduction is reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available effects of fluctuations in exchange rates between the brazilian real and foreign currencies our results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by the rate of depreciation or appreciation of the brazilian real against foreign currencies we have a global production and distribution platform political uncertainties and general economic conditions in the countries where we operate may adversely affect our results of operations a substantial portion of our net revenue is linked to foreign currencies because a large part of our exports are denominated in foreign currencies any depreciation or appreciation of the real against foreign currencies may impact our export revenues causing a monetary increase or decrease provided that the other variables remain unchanged in addition a substantial portion of our loans and financing is linked to foreign currencies as of march   and december   our consolidated loans and financing denominated in foreign currencies accounted for  and  respectively of our total loans and financing for this reason any depreciation of the real against foreign currencies may significantly increase our finance expense and our current and noncurrent loans and financing denominated in reais conversely any appreciation of the real against foreign currencies may significantly decrease our finance expense and its current and noncurrent loans and financing denominated in reais results of operations in the following discussion references to increases or decreases in any period are made by comparison with the corresponding prior period except as the context otherwise indicates our consolidated results of operations for the threemonth period ended march   and year ended december   are of limited comparability with our results of operations for the threemonth period ended march   and the year ended december   respectively due to the acquisition of tyson foods assets in brazil and mexico which closed on december   and june   respectively and primo moy park and cargill acquisitions which closed on march   september   and october

by refinancing shortterm debt through longerterm borrowings and issuing longerterm debt securities in order to increase our liquidity levels and improve our strategic financial and operational flexibility and  reduce our financing costs by accessing lowercost sources of finance including through the international capital markets and export finance based on the profile of our indebtedness as

our capacity to meet our financial obligations our shortterm loans and financing including the current portion of our noncurrent loans and financing increased from r million as of december   to r

products and services we generate the majority of our revenue in each segment from product sales we sell our products domestically in the countries where we operate our facilities which we classify as domestic sales and elsewhere which we classify as export sales for example a product sold in the united states would be classified as a domestic sale if produced in one of our plants in the united states or an export sale if produced in another country our range of fresh products includes fresh and frozen beef lamb and sheep products including traditional cuts prime cuts and offal fresh and frozen pork products including pork carcasses bonein cuts boneless cuts pork bellies and offal and refrigerated and frozen chicken products including whole and cutup chickens bonein chicken parts and

management and raw materials trading services in brazil cattle “hotelling” operations involve the custom housing and feeding of cattle that are owned by third parties in return for fees while the feedlot operator generally sells the cattle on behalf of the owner deducting the fees from the sale proceeds the ultimate risk of the cattle going unsold is borne by the cattle’s owner not the feedlot

products in the north american market and two of our subsidiaries in england and belgium market our beef products for sale and distribution in europe asia and africa raw materials the primary raw material for our beef processing operations is live cattle we seek to purchase cattle from ranchers in brazil generally located within  kilometers of one or more of our beef processing plants the close proximity of our cattle suppliers to our beef processing facilities results in reduced transportation costs and reduces the risk of weight loss and bruising of cattle during transportation we employ experienced cattle buyers who purchase cattle in the principal cattle raising areas in brazil our buyers are trained to select high quality diseasefree animals and we constantly monitor their performance we purchase cattle only from select registered producers based on rigorous animal selection guidelines our cattle suppliers are required to document the quality of their operations and verify that their use of antibiotics and agricultural chemicals complies with industry standards all cattle that we purchase in brazil are inspected by officials from the brazilian federal inspection service of the ministry of agriculture serviço de inspeção federal do ministério da agricultura or sif we may also enter into livestock purchase agreements with our cattle suppliers cattle supply and prices are affected by several factors such as climate access to capital by cattle raisers and harvest period the majority of the cattle slaughtered in brazil is grassfed and its seasonality depends on the availability of grass during the intercrop season between june and november the lack of grass consequently reduces the availability of animals to be slaughtered on the other hand during the harvest between december and may the availability of animals increases    table of contents facilities we own and operate  beef processing plants in brazil located in the states of acre bahia goiás

onetime feeding capacity of more than  cattle located in colorado idaho kansas oklahoma arizona and texas and one feedlot in canada in the united states and canada we have entered into “hotelling” agreements with affiliates of jf for more information see “related party transactions—agreements with jf oklahoma—cattle supply and feeding agreement and cattle supply and feeding incentive program agreement” and “—agreements with jf ranch canada—cattle supply and feeding agreement” raw materials the primary raw material for our united states and canadian beef processing facilities is live cattle we do not own cattle on feed and we generally purchase cattle in the spot market or pursuant to marketpriced supply    table of contents arrangements from feedlot operators and typically hold cattle for less than one day before processing after processing we sell the finished beef product at spot prices because we generally buy cattle at market prices and sell the finished beef product at market prices with just a short time between the purchase and sale we are not exposed to changing market prices over as great a span of time as vertically integrated processors as such we are primarily a “spread” operator and our operating profit is largely determined by plant operating efficiency and not by fluctuations in prices of cattle and beef although we have in excess of  cattle suppliers we also purchase a significant portion of our livestock cattle from affiliates of jf for more information see “related party transactions—agreements with jf oklahoma—cattle purchase and sale

primary raw materials of our australian and new zealand processing facilities are live cattle lamb sheep and pork our australian cattle procurement function is focused on efficiently sourcing both grassfed cattle and feeder cattle for our grainfed business grassfed cattle are primarily sourced from third party suppliers with specific weight and grade characteristics this process helps ensure that the cattle we source meet our future order requirements the majority of our grainfed cattle are sourced from our own feedlot operations    table of contents we also purchase cattle from an

fresh pork products to     •   national and regional retailers including grocery store chains independent grocers and our own retail stores wholesale distributors and food processors     •   international retailers and wholesale distributors including in china hong kong the middle east europe and emerging markets and     •   the foodservice industry including foodservice distributors fast food and other restaurants hotel chains and other institutional customers raw materials our pork operations are mostly vertically integrated and we own and raise hogs on feed for use in our own slaughterhouses the growing of hogs is outsourced to contract farmers under strict supervision and control we purchase a small number of hogs from third parties in the spot market the feed ingredients needed to raise hogs are substantially similar to those used to feed chickens we generally purchase feed ingredients in the spot market or under forward purchase arrangements priced at market prices upon delivery or with fixed prices we seek to hedge the feed ingredients we purchase in brazil through financial instruments negotiated on the bmfbovespa in order to attempt to protect ourselves from price variations between the date of their purchase and the date of their delivery    table of contents facilities our fresh pork operations in south america include eight processing facilities

classify as domestic sales and elsewhere which we classify as export sales we sell our united states pork products in more than  countries on five continents most of our united states pork production is sold to asia mexico and canada since the european union prohibits the import of animals treated with certain antibiotics and certain growth hormones commonly used in the united states however our worthington minnesota pork processing plant is eucertified and does sell some of its production to the european union we sell our united states pork products through several channels including     •   national and regional retailers including grocery supermarket chains independent grocers and club stores and wholesale distributors     •   further processors who use our pork products as a food

institutional customers raw materials the primary raw material that we use in our processing plants is live hogs vertically integrated pork processors who own hogs on feed can be subject to significant financial impact in terms of working capital utilization since hogs on feed eat in the yards for approximately  days in addition since hogs on feed consume feed with a replacement price that is subject to market volatility vertically integrated pork processors have direct financial exposure to the volatility in grains and feedstock prices we own approximately  of our finished hogs need and the balance we purchase under longterm supply contracts at prevailing market prices we process the hogs in our production facilities and sell the finished products at spot prices because the finished hogs typically are acquired within  hours of processing they are not exposed to changing market prices over an extended span of time as vertically integrated processors we employ a network of hog buyers at our processing plants and buying stations to secure our hog supply our hog purchases are made through various forms of supply contracts that provide us with a stable supply of highquality hogs these supply contracts are typically four to five years in duration and stipulate minimum and maximum purchase commitments with prices based in part on the market price of hogs upon delivery with adjustments based on quality weight lean composition and meat quality we purchase our remaining hogs on the spot market at a daily market price with the same general quality and yield grade as we require under our contracts    table of contents facilities in the united states we own and operate five pork processing plants with the ability to process approximately  hogs daily

operate sales offices in the united kingdom belgium chile china hong kong italy the netherlands and the united arab emirates these offices’ proximity to our end consumers enables them to provide efficient and customized service in accordance with cultural preferences and consumption patterns in each of these markets competition beef and pork industries the beef and pork sectors are highly competitive in the markets in which we operate we believe that the main competitive factors in the beef and pork industries are operational efficiency product availability quality and cost of raw materials manpower price quality food safety product distribution technological innovation and brand loyalty our ability to compete effectively depends on our capacity to compete in these areas in the beef sector our primary competitors are marfrig and minerva sa in brazil as well as international beef producers such as tyson foods national beef packing company llc and cargill inc in the united states and teys bros pty ltd and nippon meat packers ltd in australia in the pork sector our primary competitors are smithfield foods inc tyson foods seaboard foods and hormel foods corporation in the united states and cooperativa aurora—cooperativa central oeste catarinense ltda in brazil in addition our united states canadian and australian beef operations also compete with our south american beef operations to a limited degree for example our australian operations export to markets in the european union africa and the middle east japan and south korea which are markets to which our south american operations also exports we do not believe our intracompany competition in these markets has a material adverse effect on our current business poultry industry the poultry sector is highly competitive in the markets in which we operate we believe that the main competitive factors in the poultry industry vary in accordance with the market in the retail market we believe that competition is primarily based on product quality brand awareness client service and price in the food services market we believe that competition is primarily based on consistent quality product development customer service and price our ability to compete effectively depends on our capacity to compete in these areas in the poultry sector our primary competitors are tyson foods and sanderson farms inc in north america brf inc in brazil and  sisters food group in europe seasonality demand in the beef sector in the united states seasonal demand for beef products is higher in the summer and autumn months when weather patterns allow for more outdoor activities there is typically an increase in the demand for higher value products such as steaks during such months both the prices for live cattle and packaged beef tend to reach seasonal highs at such times because of the increase in consumption and more favorable conditions for the growth and housing of confined animals in the winter months there are generally more cattle available in the summer and autumn seasonal demand in australia does not fluctuate as much as it does in the united states    table of contents the pork sector in the united states presents similar seasonal cycles but in different months the greatest demand for pork occurs from october to march when the availability of hogs combined with the holidays increase the demand for ham pork loin and other pork products with greater aggregated value we experience no major seasonal fluctuations in demand in our united states mexico and puerto rico chicken business nevertheless our net sales have been historically higher in our second and third fiscal quarters corresponding to the spring and summer in north america and lower in our first fiscal quarter corresponding to the winter generally our sales in brazil are not impacted by seasonality however in regards to our chicken segment we have observed fluctuations in demand whereby our net sales in brazil from this segment are historically higher in the first half of the year coinciding with the summer and fall and sales volume of certain of our special product lines undergo considerable variation during certain holidays including christmas new year and easter nonetheless we believe that such variations do not materially affect our results our chicken and processed food businesses is generally subject to minor seasonal fluctuations in our european division which includes operations in the united kingdom ireland france and the netherlands while product mix changes seasonally with certain prepared foods and barbeque items selling in higher volumes during the summer and certain prepared foods and raw turkeys selling in higher volumes around christmas there is generally a continued demand for poultry throughout the year impact of commodity prices as in the case of beef and pork markets chicken markets are affected by fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities in north america our chicken business is more influenced by fluctuations in the prices of corn and soy meal which are feed ingredients required for our vertically integrated operations however in  we began migrating a majority of our finished goods sales contracts to a costplus type thereby mitigating its exposure to grain price fluctuations our beef and pork businesses on the other hand are only indirectly influenced by fluctuations in the prices of feed ingredients since we do not keep or raise our own cattle and we raise only about  of our hogs instead our beef and pork businesses are more directly affected by fluctuations in the spot market for beef cattle and hogs where we buy a significant part of the beef cattle and hogs required for our operations our brazilian beef operations are impacted by fed cattle supply and prices which are affected by several factors such as climate access to capital by cattle raisers and harvest period the majority of the cattle slaughtered in brazil is grassfed and its seasonality depends on the availability of grass during the intercrop season between june and november the lack of grass consequently reduces the availability of animals to be slaughtered on the other hand during the harvest between december and may the availability of animals increases a substantial portion of animal feed production used for the growing of chicken in brazil comes from soy soy products and corn and although these costs are denominated in reais the prices of these commodities tend to follow international prices which in turn are denominated in us dollars and are influenced by exchange rate fluctuations as a result our businesses are heavily influenced by fluctuations in the prices of corn and soy meal feed ingredients that are necessary for our vertically integrated operations likewise the fluctuation of commodities prices impacts the prices of raw materials primarily wheat and soya used to produce feed for our chicken operations in europe regulatory our operations are subject to local state and federal health and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate the following presents a summary of the regulatory schemes to which we are subjects in our most significant jurisdictions    table of contents brazil our operations in brazil are subject to an environmental permitting process which is required for potentially polluting activities or those that may in any way cause environmental degradation environmental permitting includes “preliminary” “installation” and “operation” permits a “preliminary” permit is granted during the preliminary phase of an enterprise or activity to authorize its location and concept attesting its environmental feasibility an “installation” permit authorizes the installation of an enterprise or activity in accordance with the specifications stated or approved plans programs and projects an “operation” permit authorizes an enterprise to operate after the conditions stated in the “installation” permit are fulfilled and verified with environmental protection measures and certain conditions for operations environmental permits must be renewed at the end of their period of validity which is determined by the competent agency depending on the business activity carrying out a potentially polluting activity without the relevant operating license is an administrative violation and may lead to the immediate suspension of the activity and imposition of a fine ranging from r to r million in addition the lack of license is considered a criminal offense and may subject the violator to imprisonment of one to six months andor a fine there is also a possibility of replacement of custodian sentences with penalties restricting rights and also the possibility of the suspension of the penalty or exoneration from criminal liability in some cases in which the damage is repaired our operations in brazil are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the brazilian ministry of agriculture ministério da agricultura pecuária e abastecimento or mapa the brazilian national health surveillance agency agência nacional de vigilância sanitária or anvisa and

additional costs in addition some of our facilities use hazardous substances such as ammonia in refrigeration systems that may leak and cause accidents that may result in liability some of our properties have been affected by contamination from spills and we and our predecessors have incurred costs to remediate such contamination we also have voluntarily upgraded some of our facilities to address concerns of local governmental officials andor our neighbors increasing efforts to control emissions of ghg are likely to impact our operations in the united states the epa issued a rule establishing a mandatory ghg reporting system for certain activities including manure management systems which exceed specified emission thresholds and some of our facilities are subject to these reporting requirements the epa is regulating ghg emissions through the clean air act our us operations are subject to the psa this statute generally prohibits meat packers in the livestock industry from engaging in certain anticompetitive practices in addition this statute requires us to make payment for our livestock purchases before the close of the next us business day following the purchase and transfer of possession of the livestock we purchase unless otherwise agreed to by our livestock suppliers any delay or attempt to delay payment will be deemed an unfair practice in violation of the statute under the psa we must hold our cash livestock purchases in trust for our livestock suppliers until they have received full payment of the cash purchase price as of march   we maintained bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately us million to secure payment obligations to our livestock suppliers we are also subject to voluntary market withdrawals and recalls of our meat products

equipment and other operations some of our facilities have been operating for many years and were built before current environmental health and safety standards were imposed andor in areas that recently have become subject to residential and commercial development pressures we are upgrading wastewater treatment facilities at a number of our facilities either pursuant to consent agreements with regulatory authorities or on a voluntary basis in anticipation of future permit requirements we do not anticipate that the capital expenditures associated with these upgrades which will be spread over a number of years will be material we have from time to time had incidents at our plants involving worker health and safety these have included ammonia releases due to mechanical failures in chiller systems and worker injuries and fatalities involving processing equipment and vehicle accidents we have taken preventive measures in response some of our properties have been impacted by contamination from spills or other releases and we have incurred costs to remediate such contamination in addition in the past we have acquired businesses with operations such as pesticide and fertilizer production that involved greater use of hazardous materials and generation of more hazardous wastes than our current operations while many of those operations have been sold or closed some environmental laws impose strict and in certain circumstances joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation of contaminated sites or thirdparty disposal sites on current and former owners and operators of the sites and on persons who arranged for disposal of wastes at such sites in addition current owners or operators of such contaminated sites may seek to recover cleanup costs from us based on past operations or contractual indemnifications we anticipate increased regulation by the usda concerning food safety by the fda concerning the use of medications in feed and by the epa and various other state agencies concerning discharges to the environment europe our operations in europe through moy park are subject to a number of local national and regional laws and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public these requirements relate to a broad range of activities including     •   the discharge of pollutants into the air and water     •   the identification generation storage handling transportation disposal recordkeeping labelling reporting of and emergency response in connection with hazardous materials including asbestos associated with our operations    table of contents   •   noise emissions from our facilities and     •   safety and health standards practices and procedures that apply to the workplace and the operation of our facilities in order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts of money and other resources from time to time to  construct or acquire new equipment  acquire or amend permits to authorize facility operations  modify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment and  clean up or decommission waste management facilities our capital and operating budgets for moy park include costs and expenses associated with complying with these laws if we do not comply with environmental requirements that apply to our operations regulatory agencies could seek to impose civil administrative andor criminal liabilities as well as seek to curtail our operations under some circumstances private parties could also seek to impose civil fines or penalties for violations of environmental laws or recover monetary damages including those relating to property damage or personal injury the presence of hazardous materials at our facilities in europe may expose us to potential liabilities associated with the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater and we could be liable for  the costs of responding to and remediating that release and  the restoration of natural resources damaged by any such release among other things we have not incurred nor do we anticipate incurring material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws or regulations we are not aware of any environmental liabilities that we would expect to have a material adverse effect on our business australia our australian operations also are subject to extensive regulation by the australian quarantine inspection service or aqis as well as australian environmental authorities the aqis andor other australian state and local authorities may from time to time adopt revisions to environmental rules and regulations with which we must comply such compliance may require us to incur additional capital and operating expenses which may be significant in order to ensure ongoing compliance with existing environmental laws rules and regulations we must from time to time replace repair or upgrade existing facilities equipment or supplies which may require us to incur additional capital some of our facilities discharge wastewater in municipally operated wastewater treatment plants and if such municipal plants are unable to comply with environmental rules we may be required to make improvements or operational changes that could result in additional costs in addition some of our facilities use hazardous substances such as ammonia in refrigeration systems that may leak and cause accidents that may result in liability some of our properties have been affected by contamination from spills and we and our predecessors have incurred costs to remediate such contamination we also have voluntarily upgraded some of our facilities to address concerns of local governmental officials andor our neighbors increasing efforts to control emissions of ghg are likely to impact our operations in australia the federal government has proposed a ghg cap and trade system that would cover agricultural operations including certain of our feedlots and at least two of our processing plants certain states in australia could also adopt regulations of ghg emissions which are stricter than australian federal regulations while it is not possible to estimate the specific impact final ghg regulations will have on our operations there can be no guarantee that these measures will not result in significant impacts on us we are also subject to voluntary market withdrawals and recalls of our meat products in the event of suspected contamination or adulteration that could constitute food safety hazards we maintain a rigorous program of interventions inspections and testing to reduce the likelihood of food safety hazards as a proactive measure our management team expanded our testing procedures in all of our beef processing plants    table of contents intellectual property although we hold a number of trademarks that are registered or have been filed and are under analysis with the brazilian

significant tac we agreed to provide regular breaks to employees during working hours and pay a total amount of r    table of contents million over  months to certain workerrelated institutions and training programs designated by the brazilian labor authorities if we fail to comply with the terms of this tac we will be subject to a monthly fine of r per worker affected relationship with unions although we are subject to labor proceedings investigations and fines in the ordinary course of business we believe we have good relations with our employees and the unions and other labor organizations that represent them see “—legal proceedings—labor proceedings” a majority of our employees worldwide are represented by labor organizations and our relationships with these employees are governed by collective bargaining agreements legal proceedings we are defendants in several legal and administrative proceedings incident to the ordinary course of our business including labor claims filed by former employees and public authorities relating to overtime payments paid leave working hours labor safety occupational accidents and compensation for exposure to health hazards civil claims involving consumer issues and contract disputes and tax claims accounting practices adopted require us to record provisions for loss contingencies when in the opinion of our management and external counsel we believe that an unfavorable result is probable and losses can be reasonably estimated the following table sets forth a summary of the legal and administrative proceedings in which we were defendants as of march          approximate number ofproceedings      aggregate provisions recorded               in millions of reais   labor                   civil                   tax and social

march   brazil frigorífico araputanga dispute purchase of slaughter facility in september  frigorífico araputanga sa or frigorífico araputanga filed a lawsuit against us in a state court in the city of araputanga in the state of mato grosso in connection with our purchase of a slaughter facility from frigorífico araputanga in  in its lawsuit frigorífico araputanga alleged that the deed transferring the slaughter facility to us was improperly registered with the real estate notary and sought i an injunction to prevent us from finalizing the transfer of the slaughter facility and ii a declaratory judgment that the purchase agreement and the public deed registered with the real estate notary were null and void frigorífico araputanga argued that the consent of the brazilian government which held a lien over the property was not obtained as required under brazilian law to effectively register the transfer deed the case was transferred to a federal court in the city of cáceres in the state of mato grosso which ruled in our favor since then new forensic accounting evidence was presented to the court which heard testimonial evidence relating to this case on march   as we consider the probability of loss to be remote no provision was recorded    table of contents trademark infringement we are party to another lawsuit filed by frigorífico araputanga which alleges that we misused one of their trademarks “frigoara” frigorífico araputanga alleges that it has suffered damages in the amount of r million which is based on a report presented by frigorífico araputanga that appraised the “frigoara” trademark in the amount of r million frigorífico araputanga also seeks punitive damages in the amount of r million this lawsuit was submitted to the federal court of cáceres on january   and was joined with the lawsuit described above under “—purchase of slaughter facility” the brazilian federal government was notified to issue an opinion on the matter but the court has suspended the lawsuit until a final decision is issued with respect to the case described above since we expect the amount of damages relating to this lawsuit if any to be limited to a percentage of our products sold under the trademark “frigoara” as of march   based on the opinion of our legal advisors we had provisioned r million for loss in connection with this lawsuit improper favoring on july   the district attorney’s office of the city of cuiabá in the state of mato grosso filed a claim challenging an icms credit granted to us by the state of mato grosso in the amount of r million according to the complaint we were improperly favored and unduly received the icms credit the district attorney’s office seeks to recover the full amount of the challenged credit as well as a fine of  of the total amount of the credit a lower court ruled in favor of the district attorney’s office ordering our bank account to be blocked in the amount of r million an appellate court subsequently upheld the lower court’s decision we have filed appeals with the brazilian supreme court supremo tribunal federal and the brazilian superior court of justice superior tribunal de justiça on december   we entered into a tac with the federal public prosecutor’s office of the state of mato grosso in respect of the claim and executed a payment of r million icms—value added tax the tax authority of the state of são paulo secretaria da fazenda do estado de são paulo has filed  tax assessments against us in which the tax authority of the state of são paulo challenges the amount of icms credits arising from the purchase of cattle and transfer of meat by us in other brazilian states the tax authority of the state of são paulo claims that the tax credits should be approved by the national council of fiscal policy conselho nacional de política fazendária or confaz and does not recognize our icms tax credits up to the amount of the icms tax paid in such other states we have used a significant portion of these credits to offset other tax obligations the total aggregate amount of these administrative proceedings was approximately r million as of march   in addition to presenting our defense in such administrative proceedings we have filed legal proceedings seeking the payment of and an indemnification for damages from such other states if the tax authority of the state of são paulo prevails in these administrative proceedings the legal proceedings filed by us suspended the requirements of the state of são paulo based on the opinion of our legal counsel and relevant case law we believe our arguments will prevail and therefore no provision has been recorded between  and  seara alimentos requested reimbursements of the contribution for the financing of social security contribuição para o financiamento da seguridade social and the social integration program programa de integração social taxes from the brazilian tax authority receita federal do brasil the brazilian tax authority disallowed approximately  of the value of these reimbursements through the fourth quarter of  resulting in probable losses of r million we have filed an administrative appeal regarding the reimbursements and await a final ruling rural workers’ assistance fund novo funrural in january  we filed a writ of mandamus to challenge the collection of certain social security contributions which we refer to as rural workers’ assistance novo funrural these underlying    table of contents administrative proceedings have been stayed and the brazilian national social security institute instituto nacional da previdência social or inss has been prohibited from collecting these contributions the regional federal court of the third region upheld the inss’s position however we have filed an extraordinary appeal which halted the court’s decision pending a final ruling by the brazilian supreme court in order to preserve its claims under the administrative proceeding and to avoid the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations period relating to these claims the inss issued  tax default notices notificações fiscais de lançamento de débito against us in the aggregate amount of approximately r million we argued that we did not pay the contributions with respect to the period described in such notices in light of the favorable decision issued by the court reviewing the writ of mandamus action which ordered the stay of the administrative proceedings and prohibited the inss from collecting the contributions until a final decision is reached under such action a similar legal proceeding was reviewed by the brazilian supreme court and ruled in favor of taxpayers currently we do not collect or withhold any amounts in connection with these contributions based on the opinion of our legal counsel and relevant case law and doctrine we believe our arguments will prevail and therefore no provision has been recorded united states erisa proceedings on december

consumed protein in the world after pork and poultry according to data from the usda the world cattle herd stood at a total of  million head in  producing  million tons of beef imports and exports according to the usda global beef imports reached a total of  million tons in  representing a  decrease from  in the future imports are expected to rise due to  increased demand from developed and emerging nations  the reduction of the russian cattle herd driven by domestic politicoeconomic instability and consequently its productive capacity and  the expectation that the volume of beef imports in china will increase as the gap between domestic production and demand widens despite being the world’s leading beef producing nation the united states is also a significant importer of beef as domestic production is insufficient to meet the full demand of united states consumers the european union china and russia are examples of other major markets experiencing deficits in beef production making them dependent on importing beef from foreign markets brazil was the world’s largest beef exporter from  to  in  australia surpassed brazil to become the world’s largest beef exporter the united states despite a production deficit is the world’s third largest beef exporting nation exporting premium beef cuts to the global market australia brazil and the us combined for  of total exports in  key geographies where we operate united states excluding india which for religious reasons does not make a significant part of its cattle herd available for commercial purposes the united states has the third largest commercial cattle herd in the world with  million head of cattle and is the world’s top beef producing nation producing  million tons of beef in  the us has more cattle in feedlots than any other country feedlots are the preferred method of raising commercial cattle in the united states due to the high quality of meat procured and the shorter time to prepare cattle for slaughter when compared to the free range method of raising cattle pure us beef processors generally buy cattle raised in feedlots on the spot market or pursuant to marketpriced supply agreements they process the cattle in their own facilities and sell the beef to various customers or further processors cattle are normally purchased at market prices and kept for less than one day before slaughter pure beef processors are primarily “spread” operators and their operating profit is largely determined by the operational efficiency of their facilities as opposed to fluctuations in market prices for cattle and beef in the united states we operate as a pure beef processor brazil brazilian cattle are predominantly raised through grazing where animals consume vegetablebased feed resulting in cattle with a generally lower fat content than cattle raised in other environments grazing and lower fat content are important attributes to the marketing position of brazilian beef especially for a number of developed countries the brazilian beef industry has undergone an intense process of internationalization from  to  beef exports have grown from approximately  of production to  in  this increase in beef exports is directly related to increased productivity in the brazilian beef sector resulting from greater availability of cattle for slaughter reduced production costs and depreciation of the real    table of contents australia grazing is also the most common method for raising and feeding cattle in australia this method has lower feed input costs and requires a longer period of time for cattle to reach maturity however australia also has a grainfed beef cattle segment which supplies beef predominantly processed for export especially to japan and south korea australia has been one of the world’s leading beef exporters for over a decade and is expected to remain the largest beef exporter to the united states which has replaced japan as the largest export market for australia global pork industry pork is the most consumed protein in the world with china the united states and the european union representing the largest markets globally according to data from the usda the world hog herd in  stood at a total of  million head producing  million tons of pork imports and exports the world pork trade is growing faster than world pork production declining trade barriers are allowing pork to move more freely around the globe than ever which is beneficial for pork producers who can produce quality pork at a competitive price according to the industry publication national hog farmer china is among the fastest growing markets for pork imports and the world’s largest pork market a growing gap between consumption and production in china is fueling demand for pork imports the usda’s foreign agricultural service expects china to import  million metric tons of pork in  this is  more than  and more than any other country except japan japan has been the world’s top pork importer for more than  years the united states was the largest pork exporting country from  to  until the european union surpassed it in  exporting  more pork than the us the european union is expected to remain the top exporter globally as it has been successfully expanding pork sales to key markets such as china south korea and japan the weakening euro relative to the us dollar has also supported growth in european pork exports combined the european union and the united states account for  of world pork exports according to the industry publication national hog farmer key geographies where we operate united states the united states has the third largest commercial hog herd in the world with  million head and is also the third largest global producer having produced  million tons of pork in  the united states is also the third largest consumer having consumed  million tons in  according to the usda in the united states pork processors include vertically integrated companies who own and raise hogs for use in their own processing facilities and pure processors who do not own hogs pure processors generally purchase finished hogs under longterm supply contracts at prevailing market prices process the hogs in their own facilities and sell the finished products at spot prices pure processors are typically exposed to oscillations in market prices for less than two weeks and are primarily “spread” operators with their operating profit largely determined by a plant’s operating efficiency and not by fluctuations in the market prices for hogs and pork products our pork operations based in the united states are a mix of pure pork processors and vertically integrated processors global chicken industry chicken is the second most consumed protein in the world after pork and the most commonly consumed protein in the united states and brazil the largest chicken consumers in the world are the united states followed by china the european union and brazil according to data from the usda the world produced  million tons of chicken in     table of contents imports and exports according to the usda world chicken imports reached a total of  million tons in  the largest importers of poultry products are japan saudi arabia mexico and the european union which together account for  of the world’s imports of chicken products in aggregate brazil is the largest exporter with  share of global chicken exports the united states is the world’s second largest chicken exporter with  million tons shipped in  export demand growth will likely be driven by increased market access removal of trade restrictions on us poultry robust chinese demand and a continued weakness in the brazilian real key geographies where we operate united states chicken products are the most commonly consumed source of protein in the united states according to the usda the united states represents the largest production and consumption market globally in  the united states produced  million tons and consumed  million tons of chicken largescale chicken processors in the us are typically vertically integrated processors vertically integrated processors own and raise brood hens to lay eggs for incubation once hatched the chicks are transported to independently contracted growth farms where they develop until they reach the age of seven to nine weeks the processor supplies the hired farmers with the chicks feed and veterinary services additionally since chicks consume feed meal produced from corn and soybean meal with a replacement price that is subject to variations in market price vertically integrated poultry processors have direct financial exposure to volatility in such grain prices the us chicken sector is characterized by daily price alterations based on seasonal consumption patterns and overall supply and demand for chicken and other meats in the united states and abroad the prices for chicken vary over time and are affected by inventory levels production

pertaining to income tax including estate or gift tax laws or under any state local or nonus tax laws or under any applicable income tax treaty us federal income tax consequences of the distribution assuming that the distribution qualifies as a taxfree distribution the distribution of jbs foods international shares to us holders of jbs sa shares will result in the following tax consequences     •   except for any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of jbs foods international shares a us holder will not recognize any income gain or loss as a result of the receipt of jbs foods international shares in the distribution    table of contents   •   the aggregate tax basis in the shares of jbs sa shares and jbs foods international shares in the hands of each us holder of jbs sa shares immediately after the distribution will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the jbs sa shares held by such holder immediately before the distribution allocated between the shares of jbs sa shares and jbs foods international shares including fractional shares in proportion to their relative fair market values immediately following the distribution     •   a us holder’s holding period in the jbs foods international shares received in the distribution will include the holding period of the jbs sa shares with respect to which the jbs foods international shares were received     •   the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of jbs foods international shares generally will be treated as a sale of the fractional shares of jbs foods international shares and a us holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and such holder’s basis in the fractional shares of jbs foods international shares as determined above the gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the holding period for the fractional shares of jbs foods international shares as determined above is more than one year the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations any gain or loss generally will be treated as us source gain or loss us holders of jbs sa shares that have acquired different blocks of jbs sa shares at different times or at different prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of their aggregate tax basis in and their holding period in the jbs foods international shares distributed with respect to blocks of jbs sa shares if the distribution were determined not to qualify for nonrecognition of gain and loss to us holders under section  of the code each us holder of jbs sa shares who receives jbs foods international shares in the distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of the jbs foods international shares determined at the time of the distribution received by such holder in the distribution including fractional shares in such event such distribution will be treated as a taxable dividend to each us holder of jbs sa shares but only to the extent that such distribution is paid out of jbs sa’s current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds jbs sa’s current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles such excess would be treated first as a taxfree return of a us holder’s tax basis in such holder’s jbs sa common shares and then to the extent such excess amount exceeds such holder’s tax basis in such jbs sa common shares as capital gain jbs sa however does not calculate its earnings and profits under us federal income tax principles therefore a us holder should expect that the distribution of jbs foods international shares would be reported as a dividend even if such distribution would otherwise be treated as a taxfree return of capital or as capital gain under the rules described above the distribution of jbs foods international shares would not be eligible for either the dividendsreceived deduction generally available to us corporations under the code or for the lower rates applicable to “qualified dividend income” for noncorporate us holders backup withholding and information reporting payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares of jbs foods international shares to a us holder pursuant to the

consequences of owning and disposing of jbs foods international shares received in the distribution treatment of jbs foods international bdrs for us federal income tax purposes us holders of bdrs generally should be treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented by the bdrs accordingly the us federal income tax consequences below generally should apply equally to us holders of bdrs distributions on jbs foods international shares subject to the discussion below under “—passive foreign investment company” the gross amount of any distribution that jbs foods international makes to a us holder with respect to jbs foods international shares including the amount of any taxes withheld therefrom will generally be includible in such holder’s gross income in the year actually or constructively received as dividend income but only to the extent that such distribution is paid out of jbs foods international’s current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds jbs foods international’s current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles such excess will be treated first as a taxfree return of a us holder’s tax basis in such holder’s jbs foods international shares and then to the extent such excess amount exceeds such holder’s tax basis in such jbs foods international shares as capital gain jbs foods international however may not calculate its earnings and profits under us federal income tax principles in that case a us holder should expect that any distribution jbs foods international makes will be reported as a dividend even if such distribution would otherwise be treated as a taxfree return of capital or as capital gain under the rules described above dividends paid by jbs foods international will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction allowed to corporations in respect of dividends received from other us corporations with respect to certain noncorporate us holders including individual us holders dividends will be taxed at the lower capital gains rate applicable to “qualified dividend income” provided that i the jbs foods international shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states or jbs foods international is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the united states ii jbs foods international is not a passive foreign investment company as discussed below under “—passive foreign investment company” for its taxable year in which the dividend is paid and the preceding taxable year and iii certain holding period requirements are met jbs foods international expects that dividends it pays on its shares generally will be qualified dividend income subject to certain conditions and limitations nonus taxes withheld from dividends on the jbs foods international shares may be treated as foreign taxes eligible for a credit against the us federal income tax liability of a us holder for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit dividends paid on the jbs foods international shares will be treated as income from sources outside the united states and will generally constitute passive category income further in certain circumstances if a us holder holds its jbs foods international shares for less than a specified minimum period the us holder will not be allowed a foreign tax credit for nonus taxes imposed on dividends paid on its shares the rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex us holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances dispositions of jbs foods international shares subject to the discussion below under “—passive foreign investment company” a us holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss on any sale exchange redemption or other taxable disposition of its jbs foods international shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized for the shares and such us holder’s tax basis in the shares as determined above any such capital gain or loss will be longterm    table of contents if the us holder’s holding period in the shares exceeds one year longterm capital gains of noncorporate taxpayers are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations any gain or loss generally will be treated as us source gain or loss passive foreign investment company a nonus corporation will be classified as a passive foreign investment company or pfic for us federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which the corporation satisfies either of the following requirements     •   at least  of its gross income is “passive income” or     •   at least  of the average gross fair market value of its assets is attributable to assets that produce “passive income” or are held for the production of “passive income” passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends interest royalties rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions in addition there is a lookthrough rule for investments in subsidiary corporations under this rule if a nonus corporation owns directly or indirectly at least  of another corporation the nonus corporation is treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation and earning its proportionate share of the income of the other corporation for purposes of determining if the nonus foreign corporation is a pfic based upon the composition of its income its assets and the nature of its business jbs foods international expects that it will not be classified as a pfic for its current taxable year or the foreseeable future there can be no assurance however that jbs foods international will not be considered to be a pfic for any particular year because pfic status is factual in nature depends upon factors not wholly within jbs foods international’s control generally cannot be determined until the close of the taxable year in question and is determined annually if jbs foods international were a pfic for any taxable year during which a us holder owned the shares gains recognized by such us holder on a sale or other disposition of the shares would be allocated ratably over the us holder’s holding period for such shares the amount allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any year before the jbs foods international became a pfic would be taxed as ordinary income the amount allocated to each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations as appropriate and an interest charge would be imposed on the amount allocated to each such taxable year further any distribution on the shares in excess of  of the average of the annual distributions on such units or the underlying shares received by a us holder during the preceding three years or the us holder’s holding period whichever is shorter would be subject to taxation in the same manner as gain as described immediately above if jbs foods international is classified as a pfic in any year that a us holder is a shareholder jbs foods international generally will continue to be treated as a pfic for that us holder in all succeeding years even if jbs foods international ceases to satisfy the requirements of being a pfic if a us holder the shares during any taxable year in which jbs foods international is a pfic that holder generally will be required to file an annual irs form  significant penalties are imposed for failure to file irs form  and the failure to file such form may suspend the running of the statute of limitations us holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the pfic rules to their investment in the shares backup withholding and information reporting payments of dividends to a us holder and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of jbs foods international shares may under certain circumstances be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or in the case of backup withholding furnishes its taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules backup withholding is not an additional tax and generally will be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder’s us federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs    table of contents foreign asset reporting certain us holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the jbs foods international shares subject to certain exceptions including an exception for shares held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions by filing irs form  statement of specified foreign financial assets with their us federal income tax return us holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding their information reporting obligations if any with respect to their ownership and disposition of jbs foods international shares material brazilian tax consequences in general the following summary describes the material brazilian tax consequences relating to the acquisition ownership and disposition of jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares by  a holder that is not domiciled in brazil for tax purposes “nonresident holder” and  a holder that is an individual domiciled in brazil for tax purposes as defined by the applicable brazilian tax legislation “brazilian resident holder” it is not a comprehensive discussion of all the tax consequences that may be relevant to a decision to acquire jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares and it is not applicable to all categories of investors some of which may be subject to special tax rules not specifically addressed herein it is based upon the tax laws of brazil in effect as of the date of this prospectus which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect and to differing interpretations any change in the applicable brazilian laws and regulations may impact the consequences described below the tax consequences described below will also apply to the investors that receive jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares as a consequence of the distribution carried out by jbs sa the tax consequences described below do not take into account tax treaties entered into by brazil and other countries the discussion also does not address any tax consequences under the tax laws of any state or locality of brazil prospective purchasers of jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to an investment in jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares in light of their particular investment circumstances material brazilian tax consequences for holders of jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares nonresident holder income tax dividends and other income dividends or other similar income arising from jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares and paid by jbs foods international should not be subject to taxation in brazil when paid in favor of a nonresident holder gains according to law no  dated december   gains assessed on the sale or other disposition of assets located in brazil are generally subject to income tax in brazil regardless of whether the sale or disposition is made by the nonresident holder to a resident or person domiciled in brazil or to other nonresident    table of contents with respect to jbs foods international bdrs as they are assets registered in brazil they would most likely fall within the definition of assets located in brazil for purposes of law no  notwithstanding the possibility of different interpretations of the matter given the lack of precedent on the matter and in light of the general and unclear scope of regulations dealing with the subject we cannot predict which position will ultimately prevail in the courts of brazil under this scenario a conservative approach would recommend taxation in brazil of jbs foods international bdrs as an asset located in brazil on the other hand jbs foods international ordinary shares should not be treated as an asset located in brazil and therefore their disposal should not generate income tax in brazil taking the above into consideration it is important to clarify that for purposes of brazilian taxation the income tax rules on gains related to disposition of assets in brazil as jbs foods international bdrs vary depending on the domicile of the non resident holder the form by which such nonresident holder holds its investment andor how the disposition is carried out as described below as a general rule capital gains realized on the disposition of assets located in brazil is equal to the difference between the amount in brazilian currency realized on the sale or exchange of the assets and their acquisition cost without any correction for inflation capital gains realized by a nonresident holder on a sale or disposition of jbs foods international bdrs carried out on the brazilian stock exchange which includes the transactions carried out on the organized overthecounter market “otc” are     •   exempt from income tax when realized by a nonresident holder that  holds its investment in brazil under the rules of cmn resolution no  “ holder” of the brazilian monetary council and  is not resident or domiciled in a jurisdiction that imposes income tax at a maximum rate of  “low or nil tax jurisdiction”     •   subject to income tax currently at a rate of  in case of gains realized by a nonresident holder that is not a  holder andor is resident or domiciled in a low or nil tax jurisdiction in this case a withholding income tax “wht” of  of the sale value shall be applicable and withheld by the intermediary institution ie a broker that receives the order directly from the nonresident holder which can be later offset against any income tax due on the capital gain earned by the nonresident holder capital gains assessed on a sale or disposition of jbs foods international bdrs that is not carried out on the brazilian stock exchange or the organized otc are currently subject to  income tax at a rate of  when realized by any nonresident holder that is not resident or domiciled in a low or nil tax jurisdiction and  income tax at a rate of  when realized by a nonresident holder domiciled or resident in a low or nil tax jurisdiction if these gains are related to transactions conducted on the brazilian nonorganized otc market with an intermediary a wht of  on the sale value will also apply and can be used to offset the income tax due on the capital gain in the case of redemption of jbs foods international bdrs or capital reduction by jbs foods international as well as on the withdrawal of jbs foods international bdrs in exchange for jbs foods international ordinary shares the positive difference between the amount received by the nonresident holder and the acquisition cost of the corresponding securities disposed will be treated as a capital gain derived from a transaction of jbs foods international bdrs carried out outside a brazilian stock exchange subject to income tax accordingly at a rate of  or up to  as described above notwithstanding the above as a general rule capital gains arising on disposals of jbs foods international bdrs carried out since january   will be taxed based on progressive rates varying from  up to  or  if the nonresident holder is located in a low or nil tax jurisdiction while such potential increase is not applicable to transactions carried out within the brazilian stock exchange there could be different interpretations on whether or not such rules would be applicable to nonresident holder in nonorganized otc transactions    table of contents any exercise of preemptive rights relating to the jbs foods international ordinary shares should not be subject to brazilian income taxation gains realized by a nonresident holder on the disposition of preemptive rights in brazil should be subject to brazilian income taxation according to the same rules applicable to the sale or disposition of shares tax authorities may attempt to tax such gains even when the sale or assignment of such right takes place outside brazil based on the provisions of law no  tax on foreign exchange transactions “ioffx” the conversion of brazilian currency into foreign currency and the conversion of foreign currency into brazilian currency may be subject to the tax on foreign exchange transactions “ioffx” the rate of ioffx applicable to inflow and outflow transactions for the investmentdivestment in jbs foods international bdrs is currently zero the brazilian government is permitted to increase the rate of the iofexchange at any time up to  of the amount of the foreign exchange transaction however any increase in rates may only apply to transactions carried out after the date of the increase in rate and not retroactively tax on transactions involving bonds and securities “iofbonds” brazilian law imposes a tax on transactions involving bonds and securities or iofbonds including those carried out on a brazilian stock exchange the rate of iofbonds applicable to transactions involving jbs foods international bdrs is currently zero the brazilian government is permitted to increase such rate at any time up to  per day but only in respect of future transactions brazilian resident holder dividends and other income dividends or other similar income arising from jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares and earned by brazilian resident holder are subject to income tax in accordance with applicable rules for investments held outside brazil such earnings are subject to the individual income tax “irpf” on a monthly basis in accordance with progressive rates which vary up to  being also subject to an annual adjustment on the corresponding income tax return gains gains assessed by brazilian resident holder arising from any disposal of jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares are generally subject to income tax at a flat rate of  since january   such gains are taxed based on progressive rates varying from  up to  except for disposals of jbs foods international bdrs carried out within the brazilian stock exchange or the organized otc which will remain with the flat  rate taking into consideration that exemptions and peculiarities concerning the irpf calculation may apply we advise brazilian resident holders to consult their own lawyers and tax advisors whom can provide specific advice regarding their particular situation on any exemption or peculiarity possibly applicable in disposal of jbs foods international bdrs in brazil if brazilian resident holder decides to dispose jbs foods international bdrs in brazil and considering that this disposal is carried out on the stock exchange or on the otc market this transaction might be subject to a wht at a rate of  on its corresponding disposal amount in this case the paid amount of the wht can be offset with the income tax    table of contents

at  in case of conversions involving flows relating to jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares the brazilian government is permitted to increase the rate of the

retroactively iof bonds brazilian law imposes a tax on transactions involving bonds and securities or iofbonds including those carried out on a brazilian stock exchange the rate of iofbonds applicable to transactions involving jbs foods international bdrs is currently zero the brazilian government is permitted to increase such rate at any time up to  per day but only in respect of future transactions offsetting of taxes potentially withheld abroad we advise any brazilian resident holder to consult their own lawyers and tax advisors about the viability of offsetting brazil taxes potentially withheld abroad because of the ownership and transactions involving jbs foods international bdrs and jbs foods international ordinary shares material brazilian tax consequences on distribution of jbs foods international bdrs or jbs foods international ordinary shares upon the distribution in benefit of the shareholders of jbs sa i the nonresident holder of jbs sa common shares and the brazilian resident holder of jbs sa common shares will receive jbs foods international bdrs in return of the capital reduction implemented by jbs sa and ii the nonresident holder of jbs sa adss will receive jbs foods international ordinary shares in return of the capital reduction implemented by jbs sa based on the brazilian legislation there might be arguments to sustain that no income tax should apply to the nonresident holder of jbs sa common shares and to the brazilian resident holder of jbs sa common shares and of jbs sa adss as a consequence of the returned capital received in this context considering the value of the capital returned the non resident holder and the brazilian resident holder would allocate part of their acquisition cost in jbs sa common shares or jbs sa adss to the jbs foods international bdrs received reducing its acquisition cost on jbs sa common shares or jbs sa adss as the case may be despite the above interpretation given the lack of precedent on the matter and in light of the general and unclear scope of regulations dealing with the subject it is not possible to predict which position will ultimately prevail in the courts of brazil in respect to the nonresident holder of jbs sa adss there are arguments to sustain that no capital gain should be imposed in brazil for the non resident holder of jbs sa adss as jbs sa adss could not fall into the concept of assets located in brazil as such the law in brazil on nontaxation of such an asset is not clear in the legislation and a different interpretation might be taken by the authorities and the courts of brazil non resident holder and brazilian resident holder should consult their own tax advisors with respect to all income tax implications on the distribution event including the detailed rules related to its imposition and form of calculation and collection as well as any other tax effect that might apply as a result of any particular circumstance irish tax

the international accounting standards board iasb the presentation of our financial condition and results of operation in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs requires that certain judgments and estimates be made regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities significant assets and liabilities that are subject to these estimates include the useful life of the property plant and equipment estimated recovery value of longlived assets allowance for doubtful accounts inventories deferred income tax provision for tax civil and labor liabilities determining the fair value of financial instruments assets and liabilities and other similar estimates regarding the selection of interest rates and valuation of derivative financial instruments the settlement of a transaction involving these estimates may result in values that are different from those estimated due to the possible lack of precision inherent to the process certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application actual results may differ from those estimated depending upon the variables assumptions or conditions used by management   f table of contents jbs foods international predecessor notes to the interim consolidated financial statements at march   and  in thousands of brazilian reais r except per share data   significant accounting policies related to property plant and equipment inventory revenue recognition reportable segments and borrowings are described within the primary footnotes related thereto in order to provide an understanding regarding how our management forms its judgments about future events including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates and the sensitivity of those judgments to different variables and conditions certain of our critical accounting policies are discussed below   a accounting for business combinations and impairment of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets we have made acquisitions that generated a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets with both indefinite and finite lives as described in note  including the acquisitions of seara alimentos primo cargill and moy park among others as described in note  according to international financial reporting standards ifrs  “business combinations” the excess of the consideration paid the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree when applicable and the fair value at the acquisition date of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net identifiable asset acquired at that date is recorded as goodwill the acquisition price consists of cash paid the fair value of equity issued and the fair value of contingent consideration ifrs  does not permit that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be amortized but they should be tested annually for impairment at december  management uses judgment to identify tangible and intangible assets and liabilities valuing such assets and liabilities and in determining their remaining useful lives we generally engage third party valuation firms to assist in valuing the acquired assets and liabilities the valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on the assumptions and criteria which include in some cases estimates of future cash flows discounted at the appropriate rates the use of different assumptions used for valuation purposes including estimates of future cash flows or discount rates may result in different estimates of value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for impairment testing assets are grouped together into the group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating units cgus goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to cgus or groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination cgus are tested for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those cgus are less than the carrying amount of those items our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions including revenue growth costs and expenses capital expenditures working capital and discount rates as described in note  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material   b biological assets management uses estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of live assets poultry and hogs related to market prices average lifecycle growth and laying and reproduction profile biological assets are generally carried at cost unless an active market exists market prices for cattle and hogs are based on the   f table of contents jbs foods international predecessor notes to the interim consolidated financial statements at march   and  in thousands of brazilian reais r except per share data   group’s knowledge of a limited market for transactions at various points of the consumable and bearer assets’ lifecycle biological assets are described in note    c deferred and current income taxes we recognize deferred tax effects of tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities we estimate our income taxes based on regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we record on our statement of financial position a portion of the tax benefit corresponding to the tax losses carried forward was not recorded as an asset as management cannot determine whether realization is probable tax losses and negative bases of social contribution in brazil have no expiration date however the annual offset is limited to  of pretax income we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and will only recognize if we believe that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profit based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period we reduce the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilized any such reduction is reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available deferred and current income taxes are describe in note    d provisions for contingencies the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions regarding contingencies which affect the valuation of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues and expenses during the reported period in particular given the uncertain nature of brazilian tax legislation the assessment of potential tax liabilities requires significant management judgment we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to employment environmental product taxing authorities and other matters we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses to these matters provisions for contingencies are recorded when losses are considered to be probable and the amount can be reliably measured no provision is recorded if the risk of loss for a contingency is assessed to be reasonably possible but not probable but reasonably possible losses are disclosed in the notes to our financial statements if the risk of loss for a contingency is assessed as remote no provision or disclosure is necessary we discuss our material contingencies in note  to our financial statements   e financial instruments financial instruments are recorded only as of the date we become a party to the relevant instrument the financial asset or liability is initially recorded by its fair value plus any costs of the transaction that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial assets or liability the subsequent measuring   f table of contents jbs foods international predecessor notes to the interim consolidated financial statements at march   and  in thousands of brazilian reais r except per share data   of financial instruments occurs as of each reporting date in accordance with the rules set forth depending on the nature of the relevant financial assets and liabilities which are classified as follows  fair value through profit or loss  loans and receivables  liabilities at amortized cost and  derivative financial instruments we have not designated any of our derivative as cash flow hedges and therefore all fair value adjustments have been recorded in profit and loss for all periods

the statement of financial position foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the remeasurement at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of income under the caption “finance income” or “finance expense” group companies with a different functional currency the financial statements of the subsidiaries located abroad are prepared using each subsidiary’s respective functional currency the results and financial position of all entities with a functional currency different from the group’s presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows i assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate at the date of each

method that will be used ifrs  “revenue from contracts with customers” replaces ias  “construction contracts” ias  “revenue” and related interpretations and introduces the principles to be applied by an entity to measure and recognize of revenue the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when control of a good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards the standard permits a modified retrospective approach for the adoption under this approach entities will recognize transitional adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application january   without restating the comparative period companies will only need to apply the new rules to contracts that are not completed as of the date of initial application the effective date is january   the group is assessing the impacts on the adoption of ifrs  and has not determined the transition method that will be used ifrs  – “leases” this standard supersedes the existing standard on leasing ias  – leases and related interpretations and establishes the principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure on leasing for both parties to a contract in other words clients lessee and suppliers lessor lessees are required to recognize a leasing liability reflecting future payments of the leasing and a “right to use an asset” for almost all leases contracts excepting some shortterm leases and contracts of assets of a small amount for lessors the accounting treatment remains almost unchanged with the classification of leases in operational or financial leases and the accounting of these two kinds of lease contracts in different manners the standard comes into effect on january   a company can choose to apply ifrs  before that date but only if it also applies ifrs  “revenue from contracts with customers” the group is assessing the impacts of the adoption of ifrs  and has not defined the

contents jbs foods international predecessor notes to the interim consolidated financial statements at march   and  in thousands of brazilian reais r except per share data      business combination the company applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations with entities not under common control the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the cash or equity interests issued by the group the consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement generally all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date the group recognizes any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition by acquisition basis either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets acquisition costs are expensed as incurred goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree when applicable and the fair value at the acquisition date of any previous equity interest in the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired when the consideration is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired the gain is recognized directly in the income statement of the period as ‘bargain gain’ the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are adjusted during the measurement period which shall not exceed one year from the date of acquisition or additional assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect new information relating to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date which if known would have

   and  expressed in thousands of brazilian reais except per share data      basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb the presentation of our financial condition and results of operation in accordance with ifrs requires that certain judgments and estimates be made regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities significant assets and liabilities that are subject to these estimates include the useful life of the property plant and equipment estimated recovery value of longlived assets allowance for doubtful accounts inventories deferred income tax provision for tax civil and labor liabilities determining the fair value of financial instruments assets and liabilities and other similar estimates regarding the selection of interest rates and valuation of derivative financial instruments the settlement of a transaction involving these estimates may result in values that are different from those estimated due to the possible lack of precision inherent to the process certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application actual results may differ from those estimated depending upon the variables assumptions or conditions used by management significant accounting policies related to property plant and equipment inventory revenue recognition reportable segments and borrowings are described within the primary footnotes related thereto in order to provide an understanding regarding how our management forms its judgments about future events including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates and the sensitivity of those judgments to different variables and conditions certain of our critical accounting policies are discussed below a  accounting for business combinations and impairment of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets we have made acquisitions that generated a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets with both indefinite and finite lives as described in note  including the acquisitions of seara alimentos primo cargill and moy park among others as described in note  according to international financial reporting standards ifrs  “business combinations” the excess of the consideration paid the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree when applicable and the fair value at the acquisition date of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net identifiable asset acquired at that date is recorded as goodwill the acquisition price consists of cash paid the fair value of equity issued and the fair value of contingent consideration ifrs  does not permit that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be amortized but they should be tested annually for impairment generally at fourth quarter of each year management uses judgment to identify tangible and intangible assets and liabilities valuing such assets and liabilities and in determining their remaining useful lives we generally engage third party valuation firms to assist in valuing the acquired assets and liabilities the valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on the assumptions and criteria which include in some cases estimates of future cash flows discounted at the appropriate rates the use of different assumptions used for valuation purposes including estimates of future cash flows or discount rates may result in different estimates of value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for impairment testing assets are grouped together into the group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating units cgus goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to cgus or groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination   f table of contents jbs foods international predecessor notes to the consolidated financial statements at december    and  expressed in thousands of brazilian reais except per share data     cgus are tested for impairment annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those cgus are less than the carrying amount of those items our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions including revenue growth costs and expenses capital expenditures working capital and discount rates as described in note  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material b  biological assets management uses estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of live assets poultry and hogs related to market prices average lifecycle growth and laying and reproduction profile biological assets are generally carried at cost unless an active market exists market prices for cattle and hogs are based on the group’s knowledge of a limited market for transactions at various points of the consumable and bearer assets’ lifecycle biological assets are described in note  c  deferred and current income taxes we recognize deferred tax effects of tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities we estimate our income taxes based on regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we record on our statement of financial position a portion of the tax benefit corresponding to the tax losses carried forward was not recorded as an asset as management cannot determine whether realization is probable tax losses and negative bases of social contribution in brazil have no expiration date however the annual offset is limited to  of pretax income we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and will only recognize if we believe that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profit based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period we reduce the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilized any such reduction is reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available deferred and current income taxes are describe in note  d  provisions for contingencies the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions regarding contingencies which affect the valuation of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues and expenses during the reported period in particular given the uncertain nature of brazilian tax legislation the assessment of potential tax liabilities requires significant management judgment we are subject to lawsuits investigations and other claims related to employment environmental product taxing authorities and other matters we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses to these matters   f table of contents jbs foods international predecessor notes to the consolidated financial statements at december    and  expressed in thousands of brazilian reais except per share data     provisions for contingencies are recorded when losses are considered to be probable and the amount can be reliably measured no provision is recorded if the risk of loss for a contingency is assessed to be reasonably possible but not probable but reasonably possible losses are disclosed in the notes to our financial statements if the risk of loss for a contingency is assessed as remote no provision or disclosure is necessary we discuss our material contingencies in note  to our financial statements e  financial instruments financial instruments are recorded only as of the date we become a party to the relevant instrument the financial asset or liability is initially recorded by its fair value plus any costs of the transaction that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial assets or liability the subsequent measuring of financial instruments occurs as of each reporting date in accordance with the rules set forth depending on the nature of the relevant financial assets and liabilities which are classified as follows  fair value through profit or loss  loans and receivables  liabilities at amortized cost and  derivative financial instruments we have not designated any of our derivative as cash flow hedges and therefore all fair value adjustments have been recorded in profit and loss for all periods presented see note  f  foreign currency translation functional and presentation currency the functional currency of a company is the local currency within the primary economic environment in which it operates these consolidated financial statements are presented in brazilian reais r which is the company’s presentation and functional currency all financial information is presented in thousands of reais except when otherwise indicated transactions in foreign currencies other than a company’s functional currency are initially measured in the respective functional currencies of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are remeasured at the closing exchange rate on the statement of financial position foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the remeasurement at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of income under the caption “finance income” or “finance expense” group companies with a different functional currency the financial statements of the subsidiaries located abroad are prepared using each subsidiary’s respective functional currency the results and financial position of all entities with a functional currency different from the group’s presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows     i assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate at the date of each closing period     ii income and expenses are translated at the monthly average rate and     iii all resulting exchange differences are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and are presented in the statement of comprehensive income in foreign currency translation adjustments and in the equity   f table of contents jbs foods

the company consolidates all majorityowned subsidiaries the company controls an entity when it is exposed or has the right to variable returns resulting from its involvement with the entity and it has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group the consolidation is discontinued from the date that control ceases investments in associates and joint venture “joint ventures” are recorded using the equity method an associate is an entity over which the company has significant influence but does not exercise control joint ventures are all entities over which the company shares control with one or more parties accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the group intercompany transactions balances income and expenses transactions between group companies are eliminated in consolidation the noncontrolling interest represents the portion of consolidated subsidiaries not owned by the group and is presented in the financial statements as part of shareholder’s equity as well as the net income loss attributable to them in the statement of income when the company acquires or disposes of shares of an entity that it already controls any gains or losses resulting from the difference between the amount paid or received and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on a per share basis are recorded within the capital reserve a component of shareholders’ equity

classification measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules for hedge accounting the effective date is january   the group is assessing the impacts on the adoption of ifrs  and has not determined the transition method that will be used ifrs  “revenue from contracts with customers” replaces ias  “construction contracts” ias  “revenue” and related interpretations and introduces the principles to be applied by an entity to measure and recognize of revenue the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when control of a good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards the standard permits a modified retrospective approach for the adoption under this approach entities will recognize transitional adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application  january   without restating the comparative period companies will only need to apply the new rules to contracts that are not completed as of the date of initial application the effective date is january   the group is assessing the impacts on the adoption of ifrs  and has not determined the transition method that will be used ifrs  – “leases” this standard supersedes the existing standard on leasing ias  – leases and related interpretations and establishes the principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure on leasing for both parties to a contract in other words clients lessee and suppliers lessor lessees are required to recognize a leasing liability reflecting future payments of the leasing and a “right to use an asset” for almost all leases contracts excepting some shortterm leases and contracts of assets of a small amount for lessors the accounting treatment remains almost unchanged with the classification of leases in   f table of contents jbs foods international predecessor notes to the consolidated financial statements at

standard comes into effect on january   a company can choose to apply ifrs  before that date but only if it also applies ifrs  “revenue from contracts with customers” the group is assessing the impacts of the adoption of ifrs  and has not defined the transition method that will be used there are no other ifrss or ifric interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the group’s financial statements    business combination the company applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations with entities not under common control the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the cash or equity interests issued by the group the consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are generally measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date the group recognizes any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition by acquisition basis either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets acquisitions costs are expensed as incurred goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree when applicable and the fair value at the acquisition date of any previous equity interest in the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired when the consideration is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired the gain is recognized directly in the statement of income of the period as ‘bargain gain’ the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are adjusted during the measurement period which shall not exceed one year from the date of acquisition or additional assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect new information relating to facts and

the carrying amount may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets which relate to trademarks are reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate assets may be impaired if impairment exists a loss would be recorded to write down the indefinitelived assets to their recoverable amount management deemed that certain trademarks are indefinite life intangible assets due to verifiable history and expected use of the asset by the company the trademarks acquired have no legal regulatory or contractual
