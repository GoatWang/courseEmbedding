httpthemathergroupllccomwpcontentuploadswikipediamp     ny times bestselling author has wikipedia page deleted even ny times bestselling authors aren’t immune to the occasionally triggerhappy wikipedia community not having a wikipedia page is both detrimental to your seo and google results but more important for this author it is also the way to gain legitimacy and status on the internet if you don’t have a wikipedia page you aren’t even seen this was especially important as he had a new book coming out that was likely to be searched for on the internet for more information prior to someone purchasing the book the mather group carefully rewrote his page and coded it in the special wiki language we republished it and when we did so added citations to it and linked from other articles that mentioned the author back to the main page this made the wiki page stronger as it wasn’t an “orphan” any longer most importantly we continued to defend it from being deleted as we monitored it the author now has a fullyfunctional and stable wikipedia page which has given him more shelf space on google the mather group continues to monitor his page to make sure that it is
