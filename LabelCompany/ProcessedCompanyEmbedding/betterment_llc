significantly up how can one expect it to do it better in the longterm on the contrary charles schwabs intelligent portfolio seem to reflect the market i would advise investors to keep a close watch on their portfoliohelpfulyesnojack of plano tx on oct  satisfaction ratingbetterment seems to perform two functions they are a phishing site to collect personal information which they refuse to delete and a front for vanguard funds it is amazing that the best investments emanate from vanguard and schwab the investments they propose would indicate they get a commission from the seller and a fee from their client my opinion  a bunch of lowlifeshelpfulyesnopaul of sioux falls sd on aug  satisfaction ratingagents were very thorough and efficiently walked me through the process i was very pleased with the results and have lower payments now theres a broad level of customization options available to create a portfolio that works and fits with just about every income i was pleased with this product there were no additional fees that i recall unless they were hidden within the monthly installment overall the cost was a bit high but fair considering what you get out of it it took some time to get used to the interface but once i was acclimated to it i was working it like a professional its very nice to have a product you can use yourself rather than paying an individual to do it for youhelpfulyesnomelissa of cochranton pa on aug  satisfaction ratingthey care and give great quality customer service it was easy and very helpful i had no problems and it gave me great pleasure and they put me at ease for my request the customization options were great and easy to choose from had a great variety of options i will use them again in the future and will continue the fees were not that much and it was convenient and very easy to understand there were no problems and there wasnt any hesitation into my decisions i was at great ease using this because i felt confident in my

the workers were always very friendly and helpful with answering my questions the customization options are great i like that they offer many and that i was able to choose which one was the closest to matching me and what i could afford at the time i dont really like the additional fees i have been fined a few times for things and i just think the fees are expensive and i do not agree with them i would say the ease of use is great i have not had any major issues with visiting the website or speaking to someone by phone overall i am very pleasedhelpfulyesnoveronica of chicago il on aug

options are great they seemed to have thought of everything when it comes to what a custom experience should be like i was able to move things around to fit my personal needs i am not a fan of additional fees but the additional fees that are offered are satisfactory and make sense in a perfect world everything would be free but that isnt so logical the ease of use is very good navigating
