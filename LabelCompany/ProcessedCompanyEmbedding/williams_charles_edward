any one of claims  to  wherein the inflammatory disease is an arthritic condition  the use according to anyone of claims  to  wherein the colostrum is hyperimmune colostrum  a composition containing colostrum and hyperimmune milk substantially as herein described and with reference to the accompanying examples and figures description field of the invention  this invention relates to a colostrumbased composition having clinical application in the management of infectionassociated disease including gastrointestinal and joint diseases background  infection of the gastrointestinal tract is common for example with bacteria viruses yeast or parasitic pathogens which can evoke acute infection eg gastroenteritis involving for example salmonella shigella or acute viral infections or chronic infections such as those involving campylobacter jejuni clostridium difficile and yersinia enterocolitica generally the hosts own immune system can deal with the presence of such pathogens however in some circumstances such pathogens for example yersinia enterocolitica and helicobacter pylori can become established in the stomach and bowel flora and cause serious disease  in healthy animals infection with pathogenic microorganisms is controlled through the immune system immunoglobulins play an integral role in the immune system the most prevalent immunoglobulin in all species of animals is immunoglobulin g igg clinical trials have demonstrated that specific antibodies exist in bovine milk which are effective against both enteropathogenic and enterogenic organisms  in all species of mammals immunoglobulins are passed from the mother to its young to provide passive immunity to a newborn animal in humans and apes igg and its compliment of antibodies pass across the placental barrier to the foetus during the second twothirds of gestation this passage appears to be selective in that other immunoglobulins are not transferred in cattle passive immunity is provided through the secretion of immunoglobulins and in particular igg in colostrum produced by the cow in the first few days after birth of the calf and the absorption of those immunoglobulins through the gastrointestinal tract of the calf this absorption appears to be selective in that there is a preferential passage of igg through the gut wall in comparison with other immunoglobulins  bovine milk antibodies have been shown to be an effective means of providing local protection within the gastrointestinal tract against disease caused by pathogenic microorganisms trials have shown that specific antibodies in bovine milk are effective against enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli cryptosporidium rotavirus and shigella flexneri  hyper immune milk him can be obtained from dairy cows that have been hyperimmunised by proprietary antigens to increase the concentration of specific antibodies ie titres that are active against the chosen antigen such methods create unique milk products containing enhanced quantities of biologically functional antibodies and immune modulators him is known to be beneficial for the prevention of certain diseases by fortifying the bodys natural resistance to diseasecausing antigens  him is also recognised to contain components that appear to have antiinflammatory activity and may have efficacy in the treatment of joint disease  gangliosides particularly gm and gd are a key component of the plasma membrane of all human cells and are particularly abundant in the nervous system they play an important role in cell to cell recognition cell signalling and cell growth gangliosides are polar complex phospholipids and comprise a ceramide backbone coupled to a sugar chain the sugar chain contains an acidic sugar nacetylneuraminate sialic acid  gangliosides are important components of human and bovine milk at different times during lactation the proportion of different gangliosides in human breast milk varies for example gd predominates initially whilst gm increases during lactation to become the main ganglioside after about one month gangioslides appear to have three major physiological functions they block the effect of certain pathogens they promote nerve cell growth and repair and they may have a role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation their ability to prevent the adherence of pathogens such as e coli rotavirus and helicobacter pylori makes them of potential benefit in the prevention of enteric infections in the intestinal tract and as antiulcer agents idota et al in biosci biotech biochem    demonstrated that gangliosides gma and gd reduced the binding of e coli to human intestinal cells  the high concentration of gangliosides in the human brain and their effects on nerve cell growth make them of potential benefit in promoting learning and for recovery from stroke and alzheimers disease lower concentrations of gangliosides in the brain have been associated with irreversibly impaired learning behaviour in rats for example further the exogenous administration of gangliosides has been shown to provide partial protection against experimental allergic neuritis and gangliosides accelerate nervous system repair in vivo in a cat model in terms of cell growthdevelopment ganglioside gm binds to epidermal growth factor egf and inhibits egfdependent receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation and cell growth decreased levels of ganglioside expression were associated with increased egf receptor autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues and increased egfstimulated cellular proliferation  there is also evidence to suggest that oacetylated gm may enhance immunological activity of intact tumour cells gangliosides are potent pharmacological regulators of cell growth and differentiation the direct addition of gangliosides to tissue culture medium causes growth inhibition by extending the length of the g phase of the cell cycle and blocks cellular proliferation in the presence of fibroblast growth factor and plateletderived growth factor  bovine colostrum is also known to be rich in other nutritionally important and biologically active components such as growth factors that have been shown in numerous scientific studies to assist with skin and microscopic tissuemuscle healing and repair antimicrobial substances eg lactoferrin minerals and vitamins some of the major growth factors and other proteins in bovine colostrum are shown in table  below table growth factorsigfngmligfngmltgfbeta nggtgfbeta ngmlimmuneantibacterial enzymesigggligggligmgligagllactoferrinmgmilysozymemglactoperoxidasemgl  hyper immune colostrum can be obtained from cows in a similar manner to that used to produce him as discussed previously  arthritis is a degenerative condition involving degeneration of the joints and connective tissue marked by pain and swelling  synovial membranes connective tissue thicken and the joints swell and are red and tender  there are numerous regulatory and growth factors present in colostrum which offer antiinflammatory protection this protection may be in part due to the elimination andor neutralisation of microbial pathogens which are known to be associated with secondary diseases such as some forms of arthritis  the traditional approach to the management of disorders of the gastrointestinal tract inflammatory disease and bone disease relies on the use of pharmaceutical compositions with their associated potential side effects  it is an object of the present invention to provide a composition which reduces or overcomes at least some of the abovementioned problems or which will at least provide the public with a useful alternative one particular object may be to produce a nutritionalbased

compositions to helicobacter pylori  fig  shows a further comparison of the in vitro binding of various compositions to candida albicans  fig  shows a further comparison of the in vitro binding of various compositions to salmonella typhimurium  figs  show compositions against a theoretical calculationdetailed description of invention  the invention is generally directed to the provision of a composition that has application in the management of a variety of infectionassociated diseases including gastrointestinal and joint diseases the management may be prophylactic or may be in response to existing symptoms  it has been found that by combining colostrum and him or products derived from these an effect on a broad range of infection causing bacteria is observed that exceeds the effect the individual components have when used alone in some bacterial cases the effect is greater than either individual component and in others the effect is the same or similar when using significantly lower amounts of the colostrumhim components in the composition  a particularly preferred additive to the composition is a ganglioside containing component gangliosides are milk lipids and the health benefits of such a component particularly if gm or gd enhanced have been discussed previously herein  other additions include calcium particularly milk derived and other milk lipids phospholipids and milk carbohydrates and derivatives  in a preferred form the composition should not include more than  by weight of him plus other components if any with the balance being made up of colostrum or colostrumderived product it is preferred that the amount of colostrum in the product is between  and  by weight more preferably between  and  and most preferably between  and  by weight the him should be present between  and  more preferably between  and  and most preferably between  and  of course other combinations of ranges could also be used  colostrum was derived from healthy nonimmunised pasturefed cows separated from the cream pasteurised and spray dried to form a protein powder the use of colostrum from hyperimmunised cows ie hyper immune colostrum is also an option in a further preferred form the colostrum powder was coated with milk phospholipids the betalipid coating including in particular phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin  bovine colostrum has been demonstrated to show specific binding against many pathogens including candida albicans e coli  helicobacter pylori propionibacterium acnes klebsiella pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pyogenes streptococcus mutans yersinia entercolitica staphylococcus epidermidis salmonella typhimurium salmonella enteritidis haemophilus influenzae campylobacter jejuni and listeria monocytogenes  in addition bovine colostrum is rich in vitamins minerals growth factors eg igg and immuneantibacterial enzymes use of hyperimmune colostrum will maximise the content of biologically functional antibodies and immune modulators present in the colostrum  colostrum also contains numerous different components which offer antiinflammatory properties including lactoferrin prolinerich polypeptide lysozyme and growth factors leg igg some of which also have antimicrobial activity in addition the bovine colostrum employed in the composition of the present invention has an immunomodulatory effect by blocking proinflammatory cytokines such as tnfalpha and il  immune milk was obtained from dairy cows hyperimmunised by proprietary antigens and methods that create unique milk products that contain enhanced quantities of biologically functional antibodies and immune modulators  the immunoglobulins in him have been shown to specifically bind the following pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa aerobacter aerogenes haemophilus typhimurium streptococcus mitis proteus vulgaris shigella dysenteriae diplococcus pneumoniae actinomyces fungus streptococcus sanguis streptococcus salvarius streptococcus pyogenes types          these pathogens are known to be contributory factors in many disease states or physiological disorders including food poisoning gastrointestinal ulcers skin and lung infection thrush dental caries and gum disease surgical infections respiratory tract disease bowel disease and haemorrhagic disease  the following list correlates

intestinebacteriodes fragilisspecies found in large intestine  gangliosides particular gm and gd as discussed above have been shown to have a range of health benefits relating to gut health brain health and cell growthdevelopment it is possible that their antiadherenceantimicrobial eg with e coli and h pylori and various microbial toxins such as shigra toxin activity may further enhance or supplement the clinical benefits of colostrum combined with him  the elisa graphs see fig  herein show that the particular ganglioside product added to the present composition has no apparent binding effect on the selected microorganisms on its own gangliosides have an antimicrobial effect but do not bind to the microorganism rather the activity is understood to be an antiadherence effect see idota et al above thus the action of the ganglioside component should not affect the microorganism binding action of the him or colostrum this suggests that the compositions effects occur without input from the ganglioside product showing that the synergies in binding effect are created between the colostrum and him  the following graphs figs  illustrate the binding effect that would be expected if the effect of combining the ingredients shown was purely additive however it can be seen in figs  that in fact a greater binding effect has been achieved than would be expected again supporting the synergistic aspect of the him and colostrum combination  it is possible that the observed enhanced binding effect of the him and colostrum composition as seen in the figures could be due to the effect of the ganglioside such an effect would be very unexpected and would in itself constitute a synergistic effect to this extent the combination of him and colostrum or derived products together with a ganglioside constituting another aspect of the present invention  to provide appropriate antimicrobial binding activity and possible synergies a concentration of gangliosides in a composition of the invention to achieve a daily dosage of  to  mg is preferred the gangliosides are preferably present in an amount of between about  to  of the composition the ganglioside containing component may therefore amount up to about  of the composition depending on the amount of ganglioside in the component more preferably the range will be between  to   a ganglioside product was prepared as a nongenetically modified product extracted directly from milk the product or gangliosidecontaining component contains concentrated gangliosides gm and gd  the composition can also contain other lipids and carbohydrates examples of lipids are sphingomyelin phophotidylserine phosphotidylcholine examples of carbohydrates are galacto oligosaccharides sialyl lactose sialated oligosaccharides these examples are not intended to be limiting  calcium employed in the compositions of the invention was also milkderived the preferred content is between about  to  of the composition more preferably between  to   the specific binding activity and complimentary action against gastrointestinal pathogens by colostrum and hyperimmune milk protein concentrates further assisted by the sialic acid binding actions of gangliosides means that compositions of the invention are targeted towards the treatment of acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease in particular for example gastric ulcers duodenal ulcers ulcerative colitis crohns disease chronic diverticulosis irritable bowel disease pseudomembranous colitis antibiotic associated diarrhoea travellers diarrhoea juvenile diarrhoea and cryptosporidiosis associated diarrhoea  by combining colostrum and hyperimmune milk in appropriate proportions a product is produced which has a broadspectrum of activity against pathogenic organisms with both predictable and potentially unexpected clinical benefits the bacterial action of the individual components is expected but the level of the activity of the combination is unexpected and offers therapeutic and cost advantages  typical composition ranges for the major components of the composition will be componentminimum maximum colostrumhyperimmune milkgangliosideother components  the total amount of him plus other components should not exceed  of the composition as will be readily apparent the ranges are indicative only  as will be shown in the examples and trials completed the effects of treatment using a composition according to the present invention are significant while the main individual components of the composition him and colostrum have known beneficial effects it is unexpected that the combination would have the efficacy shown herein to this extent it is hypothesised that there may be a synergistic interaction occurring between the him and colostrum components of the composition either directly or indirectly example   a test composition was prepared including  colostrum milk protein powder  hyperimmune milk powder  gangliosidecontaining component whey powder lactose and  milk calcium further details of the chemical makeup of the resultant composition are shown in table  table composition of trial compositioncompositionmmprotein dbfatlactoseashmoistureimmunoglobulin g determined byhplcprotein ggangliosidescalciumigfmin ± nggsphingomyelinminphosphatidyl cholineminphosphatidyl ethanolamineminphosphatidyl serinemin  in vitro binding studies  binding studies were performed to compare the binding of the test composition colostrum milk powder skim milk powder and him with various bacterial and yeast pathogens including candida albicans salmonella typhimunium helicobacter pylori e coli spp clostridium difficile and klebsiella pneumonia the results are shown in figs  in summary the test composition demonstrated a very high rate of specific binding with these species  in vitro antiinflammatory properties  the tight junction assay measures the degree of leakiness of a monolayer of epithelial cells particularly kidney cells a normal characteristic of epithelium like the intestine or kidney is that the cells form a tight barrier but this barrier function is sometimes compromised making the epithelium leaky such is the situation occurring during inflammation  in the assay cells are incubated with or without a test sample and are then challenged with a compound to make them leaky any increase in leakiness is measured and activity reported as change from the baseline prior to challenge the lower the activity unit the less leaky the cells become and hence the more protective the sample  the activity of him in this assay has been compared with its antiinflammatory properties in various mouse models of inflammation and a good correlation found thus the tight junction assay provides a good screening assay for antiinflammatory activity in milk samples  the test composition was compared in this assay with him bovine colostrum and a control each of the samples were made to  wv with phosphate buffered saline and then centrifuged at  g for one hour to remove caseins the whey fraction was tested in the tight junction assay mdck cells were grown to confluence on transwell and the whey was added at  for  hours control cells had no whey added transepithelial electrical resistance across the cell monolayer was measured before and one hour after challenge with egta all samples were tested in quadruplicate  the results are shown in table  table sampleactivity unitsbovine colostrum−test composition−hyperimmune milk−control  in comparison with the control each of the samples had significant protective activity the activity of him was significantly greater than that of bovine colostrum the test composition was statistically significantly superior to the bovine colostrum and only a little less effective than the him notwithstanding that the test composition included only  hyperimmune milk it seems clear that the test composition has increased the protective activity of the hyperimmune milk on a per unit basis this increase is considered significant  in summary the test composition of the invention includes a combination of ingredients each of which has particular antimicrobial binding andor antiinflammatory activity which may combine to produce particular and unexpected clinical benefits in a broad range of diseases including infectionassociated diseases and particularly gastrointestinal inflammatory and bone related disorders such benefits are an unexpected result of the combination used  furthermore the composition may include sufficient calcium for the average required daily human intake and includes a broad range of vitamins and minerals and has a balanced proteincarbohydrate mix the composition may be of benefit for the prophylaxis or treatment of disease alone or in combination with conventional pharmaceuticals  another typical chemical makeup of the composition according to the invention is as shown in table  table compositiontypical mmprotein dbfatlactoseashmoistureimmunoglobulin g determinedby hplcprotein gigfmin ± nggcalciumgangliosidessphingomyelinphosphatidyl cholinephosphatidyl ethanolamineminphosphotidyl serinemin  the compositions of tables  and  show a composition produced using milk protein concentrate versions of the composition as will be readily apparent to the skilled person skim milk versions can also be used example   with reference to figs  a comparison of the test composition with a control skim milk powder and the two major components of the test composition are shown the figures show the effects of the various samples in in vitro binding of a variety of pathogens  as can be seen the test composition shows significant benefits in comparison to the other samples this is surprising because the test composition contains significantly less colostrum and him than is present in the respective comparative samples  with reference to fig  it can be seen that a ganglioside sample has little or no binding effect on the pathogen candida albicans this has been discussed previously herein example   a pilot study was conducted by a gastroenterology clinic concentrating on coeliac disease and idb chrohns disease and ulcerative colitis it involved  patients who were not responding to current therapies the time period of study was  weeks dosage was  g twice daily more than  were dramatically improved more than  were clinically assessed as achieving therapeutic cure after recurrencerelapse with previous standard therapy  assessment of symptoms

as a beverage depending on whether the product is to be used for prophylaxis or as treatment and depending on the nature of the specific indication it is envisaged that the effective dosage range may be from about  g to  g per day in the management of gastrointestinal disorders a preferred dosage regimen may preferably be in the range  g per day with administration on a twice daily basis on an empty stomach where the composition is used for stomach ulcers it is anticipated that it should preferably be administered in combination with a mucolytic agent use of the composition may enable a

have all heard the charge that jesus left with his disciples before his ascension back to heaven this book is a discipleship primer easy to understand and good for helping to teach others or for your own personal growth charles kayser has a long history as a teacher in secondary education and college as well as teaching and pastoring in christian churches he has witnessed first hand a lack of true biblical maturity in the body of christ that has led so many to a lifetime of shallow living in the elementary principles of the lord a deeper life primer is an antidote to being a milk drinker and helps those who want more to go on to maturity to be able to feast on the meat of the word the foundation of discipleship is knowledge of scripture and trust in its integrity kayser states he discusses the six elementary principles listed in hebrews and then goes on to teach about righteousness and the gifts of the holy spirit product reviews▼▲ be the first to write a review write review
