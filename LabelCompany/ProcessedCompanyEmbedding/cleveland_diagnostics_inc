breast cancersaug    new prostate cancer screening test shows promise for diagnosis cleveland diagnostics nearly every cancer that iscaught early is curablelearn more   cleveland diagnostics is developing technology to detect cancer early when it can be treated and cured   early detection worksgenerally if cancer is found early  percent survive if cancer is found late  percent survive earlier detection leads to earlier more precise treatment that may treat and cure cancerhowever there are few effective early detection methods for cancer were here to change that   survival  correlated with stage of diagnosis   how were differentweve taken an outofthebox approach to detecting cancer today most laboratories rely on the overall expression of biomarkers these biomarkers often proteins are typically overexpressed in the context of cancer however it has become clear that a number of noncancerous conditions can also cause an overexpression of these biomarkers therefore false positives are very common for example psa which is the biomarker used for prostate cancer can also be overexpressed due to inflammation benign prostatic hyperplasia urinary tract infection and even something as common as riding a bikeour approach to detecting cancer at the earliest stage is to determine not just the overall expression of these biomarkers but rather their origin we have developed proprietary technology that separates protein isoforms allowing investigate proteins based on structure not concentration   surveillance epidemiology and end results seer program 9 division of cancer control and population sciences national cancer institute bethesda md  background — cleveland diagnostics  your dna is essentially a set of instructions it is made up of genes which are the molecular unit of heredity therefore genes decide your biological traits such as eye color  genetic switches determine which genes should be expressed for example a heart cell will express very different genes than a brain cell when turned on these genes are transcribed into singlestranded rna   rna is then translated into proteins which play a variety of roles in the body such as catalyzing reactions replicating dna transporting molecules and much more essentially – we all are just manifestation of proteins working together under certain physiological conditions such as stress or disease a specific protein may be overexpressed or underexpressed this is the current basis of a biomarker which is a measurable protein whose altered expression indicates that an individual has a disease however in addition to changing the level of protein diseases also modify the structure of proteins bizapediacom  human validation companiespeopleproductsservicestrademarksaddressesphone book our

cleveland diagnostics the problem with cancer diagnostics cancer diagnostics rely on an overexpression of specific biomarkers to identify a disease but what if other conditions also elevate the concentration of that biomarker in blood despite the individual not having the disease take prostate cancer for example  the standard prostate cancer diagnostic test measures the expression of the biomarker prostatespecific antigen while overexpression of psa indicates the possibility of prostate cancer high levels of psa could also be due to inflammation of the prostate or infection also some individuals with prostate cancer never have elevated psa levelspositive psa test now whatif an individual has a psa level above  ngml their physician may advise them to get a transrectal biopsy this is completed by collecting multiple samples of prostate tissue by inserting needles into the prostate however only  of men who have a psa level between  and  ngml will have prostate cancer theres got to be a better solution rightwere developing technology to provide more information to better diagnose patients and save more lives learn more solvent interaction analysis — cleveland diagnostics changes in protein expression are typically not cancerspecificwere developing technology to evaluate the changes to the structure of the protein biomarker these structural changes directly relate to cancer mutations in contrast to looking at gene mutations our technology provides direct information about the onset or progression of a disease – instead of just your risk of getting it sia simple elegant  robust   the basis of solvent interaction analysis is the separation of proteins with distinct physiochemical properties by a biphasic system two distinct immiscible solvent systems arise when polymers and salts are mixed in water separation based on structural changea sample is first placed in the aqueous twophase system the system is agitated and then centrifuged to thoroughly mix and then separate the solutes all protein isoforms partition unequally between the top and bottom phases based on their structure and interaction with other proteins   k value  our sia technology reports a quantitative ratiometric parameter that is independent of the absolute expression level called k which represents the ratio of the biomarker concentration in a customized biphasic solution the value of k is used as standard cutoff clinical parameters once calibrated against known clinical samples how do we measure the biomarker concentration in each of the two phases with a simple conventional technology such as elisa which can detect the biomarker – but is incapable of detecting changes to its structure that is done by sia news — cleveland diagnostics in the news july

updated november   at  pm comments arnon chait right shown here in a  photo with analizadx senior scientist pamela lechner will become ceo of cleveland diagnostics a new spinoff company of cleveland clinic innovations plain dealer file  cleveland ohio  cleveland clinic innovations has formed a spinoff company cleveland diagnostics inc to develop and commercialize cancer diagnostics and screening testscleveland clinic innovations the commercialization arm of the hospital system formed the new company with biotech company analizadx llc based in cleveland arnon chait president and ceo of analizadx a spinoff of analiza inc which was founded in 99 will serve as ceo of cleveland diagnostics analizadx will cease operations but the companys employees  chait says there are fewer than   will remain“as a small company you can really invent the screw driver” chait said “once you do that you have to be able to bring your product to the market we absolutely cannot do that on our own” the backing of cci will allow the new company to push forward the psasia prostate cancer screening test in development for years closer to the market chait said a few years ago analizadx in partnership with the clinic university hospitals and the veterans affairs hospital in boston conducted clinical trials for the urinebased test that promised greater accuracy than the prostatespecific antigen or psa testsia stands for solvent interaction analysis the proprietary technology created by analizadx inc earlier this year the company announced that it had entered into a licensing agreement with informatics company global health management informatics to offer the psasia tests in africa and the caribbean  cleveland diagnostics is developing technology that focuses on protein biomarker structural changes that correlate with the presence of a disease the company’s portfolio of noninvasive cancer diagnostic tests includes bloodbased tests to screen for prostate breast and ovarian cancer “with ovarian cancer we have data that shows that we can differentiate early stage disease from benign polyps and tumors” chait said “eventually we think that will become a product” early detection of cancer using a blood test could mean surgical removal with laparoscopic surgery and not the more invasive hysterectomy he said “cleveland clinic has a year history of encouraging discovery and enabling physicians and researchers to create technologies that benefit patients” dr thomas j graham md cleveland clinic’s chief innovation officer said in a statement “when fully developed cleveland diagnostics’ unique screenings will provide physicians and patients with the information they need to make decisions on treatments” health  fitness beat brie zeltner plain dealer
