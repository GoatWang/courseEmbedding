king of scots from  until his death in  robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation and eventually led scotland during the first war of scottish independence against england he fought successfully during his reign to regain scotlands place as an independent country and is today revered in scotland as a national hero descended from the anglonorman and gaelic nobilities his paternal fourthgreat grandfather was king david i roberts grandfather robert de brus th lord of annandale was one of the claimants to the scottish throne during the great cause as earl of carrick robert the bruce supported his familys claim to the scottish throne and took part in william wallaces revolt against edward i of england appointed in  as a guardian of scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne john comyn lord of badenoch and william lamberton bishop of st andrews robert later resigned in  due to his quarrels with comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of king john balliol after submitting to edward i in  and returning to the kings peace robert inherited his familys claim to the scottish throne upon his fathers death in february  robert the bruce killed comyn following an argument and was excommunicated by the pope although he received absolution from robert wishart bishop of glasgow bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of scots on  march  edward is forces defeated robert in battle forcing him to flee into hiding in the hebrides and ireland before returning in  to defeat an english army at loudoun hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the english bruce defeated his other scots enemies destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands and in  held his first parliament a series of military victories between  and  won him control of much of scotland and at the battle of bannockburn in  robert defeated a much larger english army under edward ii of england confirming the reestablishment of an independent scottish kingdom the battle marked a significant turning point with roberts armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern england while also extending his war against the english to ireland by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the native irish to rise against edward iis rule despite bannockburn and the capture of the final english stronghold at berwick in  edward ii refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of scotland in  the scottish nobility submitted the declaration of arbroath to pope john xxii declaring robert as their rightful monarch and asserting scotlands status as an independent kingdom in  the pope recognised robert i as king of an independent scotland and in  the francoscottish alliance was renewed in the treaty of corbeil in  the english deposed edward ii in favour of his son edward iii and peace was concluded between scotland and england with the treaty of edinburghnorthampton by which edward iii renounced all

was given the lands of annandale in dumfries and galloway robert i was one of the ten children and the eldest son of robert de brus th lord of annandale and marjorie countess of carrick and claimed the scottish throne as a fourth greatgrandson of david i his mother was by all accounts a formidable woman who legend would have it kept robert bruces father captive until he agreed to marry her from his mother he inherited the earldom of carrick and through his father a royal lineage that would give him a claim to the scottish throne the bruces also held substantial estates in aberdeenshire county antrim county durham essex middlesex and yorkshire early life –edit birthedit the remains of turnberry castle robert the bruces likely birthplace although robert the bruces date of birth is known his place of birth is less certain although it is most likely to have been turnberry castle in ayrshire the head of his mothers earldomnb  childhoodedit very little is known of his youth he was probably brought up in a mixture of the anglonorman culture of northern england and southeastern scotland and the gaelic culture of southwest scotland and most of scotland north of the river forth annandale was thoroughly feudalised and the form of northern middle english that would later develop into the scots language was spoken throughout the region carrick was historically an integral part of galloway and though the earls of carrick had achieved some feudalisation the society of carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically celtic and gaelic speaking robert the bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age he would have been schooled to speak read and possibly write in the anglonorman language of his scotsnorman peers and his fathers family he would also have spoken both the gaelic language of his carrick birthplace and his mothers family and the early scots language as the heir to a considerable estate and a pious layman robert would also have been given working knowledge of latin the language of charter lordship liturgy and prayer this would have afforded robert and his brothers access to basic education in the law politics scripture saints lives vitae philosophy history and chivalric instruction and romance that robert took personal pleasure in such learning and leisure is suggested in a number of ways barbour reported that robert read aloud to his band of supporters in  reciting from memory tales from a twelfthcentury romance of charlemagne fierabras as well as relating examples from history such as hannibals defiance of rome as king robert certainly commissioned verse to commemorate bannockburn and his subjects military deeds contemporary chroniclers jean le bel and thomas grey would both assert that they had read a history of his reign commissioned by king robert himself in his last years robert would pay for dominican friars to tutor his son david for whom he would also purchase books a parliamentary briefing document of c would also assert that robert used continually to read or have read in his presence the histories of ancient kings and princes and how they conducted themselves in their times both in wartime and in peacetime from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule tutors for the young robert and his brothers were most likely drawn from unbeneficed clergy or mendicant friars associated with the churches patronised by their family however as growing noble youths outdoor pursuits and great events would also have held a strong fascination for robert and his brothers they would have had masters drawn from their parents household to school them in the arts of horsemanship swordsmanship the joust hunting and perhaps aspects of courtly behaviour including dress protocol speech table etiquette music and dance some of which may have been learned before the age of ten while serving as pages in their fathers or grandfathers household as many of these personal and leadership skills were bound up within a code of chivalry roberts chief tutor was surely a reputable experienced knight drawn from his grandfathers crusade retinue this grandfather known to contemporaries as robert the noble and to history as bruce the competitor seems to have been an immense influence on the future king roberts later performance in war certainly underlines his skills in tactics and single combat the family would have moved between the castles of their lordships—lochmaben castle the main castle of the lordship of annandale and turnberry and loch doon castle the castles of the earldom of carrick a significant and profound part of the childhood experience of robert edward and possibly the other bruce brothers neil thomas and alexander was also gained through the gaelic tradition of being fostered to allied gaelic kindreds—a traditional practice in carrick southwest and western scotland the hebrides and ireland there were a number of carrick ayrshire hebridean and irish families and kindreds affiliated with the bruces who might have performed such a service roberts fosterbrother is referred to by barbour as sharing roberts precarious existence as an outlaw in carrick in – this gaelic influence has been cited as a possible explanation for robert the bruces apparent affinity for hobelar warfare using smaller sturdy ponies in mounted raids as well as for seapower ranging from oared wargalleys birlinns to boats according to historians such as barrow and penman it is also likely that when robert and edward bruce reached the male age of consent of twelve and began training for full knighthood they were sent to reside for a period with one or more allied english noble families such as the de clares of gloucester or perhaps even in the english royal household sir thomas grey asserted in his scalacronica that in about  robert the bruce then aged eighteen was a young bachelor of king edwards chamber while there remains little firm evidence of roberts presence at edwards court on  april  both robert and his father were pursued through the english chancery for their private household debts of £ by several merchants of winchester this raises the possibility that young robert the bruce was on occasion resident in a royal centre which edward i himself would visit frequently during his reign roberts first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by alexander og macdonald lord of islay his name appears in the company of the bishop of argyll the vicar of arran a kintyre clerk his father and a host of gaelic notaries from carrick robert bruce the king to be was sixteen years of age when margaret maid of norway died in  it is also around this time that robert would have been knighted and he began to appear on the political stage in the bruce dynastic interest the great causeedit roberts mother died early in  in november of the same year edward i of england on behalf of the guardians of scotland and following the great cause awarded the vacant crown of scotland to his grandfathers first cousin once removed john balliol almost immediately robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his lordship of annandale and transferred his claim to the scottish throne to his son antedating this statement to  november in turn that son robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his earldom of carrick to his eldest son robert the future king so as to protect the bruces kingship claim while their middle lord robert the bruces father now held only english lands while the bruces bid for the throne had ended in failure the balliols triumph propelled the eighteenyearold robert the bruce onto the political stage in his own right earl of carrick –edit the bruces regroupedit robert the bruce and isabella of mar as depicted in the  forman armorial even after johns accession edward still continued to assert his authority over scotland and relations between the two kings soon began to deteriorate the bruces sided with king edward against king john and his comyn allies robert the bruce and his father both considered john a usurper against the objections of the scots edward i agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of the guardians that had governed scotland during the interregnum a further provocation came in a case brought by macduff son of malcolm earl of fife in which edward demanded that john appear in person before the english parliament to answer the charges this the scottish king did but the final straw was edwards demand that the scottish magnates provide military service in englands war against france this was unacceptable the scots instead formed an alliance with france the comyndominated council acting in the name of king john summoned the scottish host to meet at caddonlee on  march the bruces and the earls of angus and march refused and the bruce family withdrew temporarily from scotland while the comyns seized their estates in annandale and carrick granting them to john comyn earl of buchan edward i thereupon provided a safe refuge for the bruces having appointed the lord of annandale to the command of carlisle castle in october  at some point in early  robert married his first wife isabella of mar the daughter of domhnall i earl of mar and his wife helen beginning of the wars of independenceedit this section needs

of berwick in a particularly bloody attack upon the flimsy palisades at the battle of dunbar scottish resistance was effectively crushed edward deposed king john placed him in the tower of london and installed englishmen to govern the country the campaign had been very successful but the english triumph would only be temporary although the bruces were by now back in possession of annandale and carrick in august  robert bruce lord of annandale and his son robert bruce earl of carrick and future king were among the more than  scots at berwick who swore an oath of fealty to king edward i of england when the scottish revolt against edward i broke out in july  james stewart th high steward of scotland led into rebellion a group of disaffected scots including robert wishart bishop of glasgow macduff the son of the earl of fife and the young robert bruce the future king was now twentytwo and in joining the rebels he seems to have been acting independently of his father who took no part in the rebellion and appears to have abandoned annandale once more for the safety of carlisle it appears that robert bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfathers friends wishart and stewart who had inspired him to resistance with the outbreak of the revolt robert left carlisle and made his way to annandale where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and according to the english chronicler walter of guisborough addressed them thus no man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and i am no exception i must join my own people and the nation in which i was born i ask that you please come with me and you will be my councillors and close comrades urgent letters were sent ordering bruce to support edwards commander john de warenne th earl of surrey to whom bruce was related in the summer of  but instead of complying bruce continued to support the revolt against edward i that bruce was in the forefront of fomenting rebellion is shown in a letter written to edward by hugh cressingham on  july  which reports the opinion that if you had the earl of carrick the steward of scotland and his brotheryou would think your business done on  july bruce and his friends made terms with edward by a treaty called the capitulation of irvine the scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to king edward the bishop of glasgow james the steward and sir alexander lindsay became sureties for bruce until he delivered his infant daughter marjorie as a hostage which he never did when king edward returned to england after his victory at the battle of falkirk the bruces possessions were excepted from the lordships and lands that edward assigned to his followers the reason for this is uncertain though fordun records robert fighting for edward at falkirk under the command of antony bek bishop of durham annandale and carrick this participation is contested as no bruce appears on the falkirk roll of nobles present in the english army and two th century antiquarians alexander murison and george chalmers have stated bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste annandale and burn ayr castle to prevent it being garrisoned by the english guardianedit william wallace resigned as guardian of scotland after his defeat at the battle of falkirk he was succeeded by robert bruce and john comyn as joint guardians but they could not see past their personal differences as a nephew and supporter of king john and as someone with a serious claim to the scottish throne comyn was bruces enemy in  william lamberton bishop of st andrews was appointed as a third neutral guardian to try to maintain order between bruce and comyn the following year bruce finally resigned as joint guardian and was replaced by sir gilbert de umfraville earl of angus in may  umfraville comyn and lamberton also resigned as joint guardians and were replaced by sir john de soules as sole guardian soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the bruce nor the comyn camps and was a patriot he was an active guardian and made renewed efforts to have king john returned to the scottish throne in july  king edward i launched his sixth campaign into scotland though he captured the castles of bothwell and turnberry he did little to damage the scots fighting ability and in january  he agreed to a ninemonth truce it was around this time that robert the bruce submitted to edward along with other nobles even though he had been on the side of the scots until then there were rumours that john balliol would return to regain the scottish throne soules who had probably been appointed by john supported his return as did most other nobles but it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it in march  bruce sent a letter to the monks at melrose abbey apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national callup bruce pledged that henceforth he would never again require the monks to serve unless it was to the common army of the whole realm for national defence bruce also married his second wife that year elizabeth de burgh the daughter of richard de burgh nd earl of ulster by elizabeth he had four children david ii john died in childhood matilda who married thomas isaac and died at aberdeen  july  and margaret who married william de moravia th earl of sutherland in  in  edward invaded again reaching edinburgh before marching to perth edward stayed in perth until july then proceeded via dundee brechin and montrose to aberdeen where he arrived in august from there he marched through moray to badenoch before retracing his path back south to dunfermline with the country now under submission all the leading scots except for william wallace surrendered to edward in february  john comyn who was by now guardian submitted to edward the laws and liberties of scotland were to be as they had been in the days of alexander iii and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of king edward and the advice of the scots nobles on  june  bruce and william lamberton made a pact that bound them each to the other in friendship and alliance against all men if one should break the secret pact he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds the pact is often interpretedby whom as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the english homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the english parliament to establish rules for the governance of scotland the earl of richmond edwards nephew was to head up the subordinate government of scotland while all this took place william wallace was finally captured near glasgow and he was hanged drawn and quartered in london on  august  in september  edward ordered robert bruce to put his castle at kildrummy in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for suggesting that king edward suspected robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back however an identical phrase appears in an agreement between edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend aymer de valence a further sign of edwards distrust occurred on  october  when edward revoked his gift of sir gilbert de umfravilles lands to bruce that he had made only six months before robert bruce as earl of carrick and now th lord of annandale held huge estates and property in scotland and a barony and some minor properties in england and a strong claim to the scottish throne murder of john comynedit the killing of comyn in the greyfriars church in dumfries as imagined by felix philippoteaux a thcentury illustrator bruce like all his family had a complete belief in his right to the throne however his actions of supporting alternately the english and scottish armies had led to a great deal of distrust towards bruce among the community of the realm of scotland his ambition was further thwarted by john comyn who had been much more resolute in his opposition to the english comyn was the most powerful noble in scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within scotland and england including relatives that held the earldoms of buchan mar ross fife angus dunbar and strathearn the lordships of kilbride kirkintilloch lenzie bedrule and scraesburgh and sheriffdoms in banff dingwall wigtown and aberdeen he also had a powerful claim to the scottish throne through his descent from donald iii on his fathers side and david i on his mothers side comyn was the nephew of john balliol according to barbour and fordoun in the late summer of  in a secret agreement sworn signed and sealed john comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the scottish throne in favour of robert bruce upon receipt of the bruce lands in scotland should an uprising occur led by bruce whether the details of the agreement with comyn are correct or not king edward moved to arrest bruce while bruce was still at the english court fortunately for bruce his friend and edwards soninlaw ralph de monthermer learnt of edwards intention and warned bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs bruce took the hint and he and a squire fled the english court during the night they made their way quickly for scotland according to barbour comyn betrayed his agreement with bruce to king edward i and when bruce arranged a meeting for  february  with comyn in the chapel of greyfriars monastery in dumfries and accused him of treachery they came to blows bruce stabbed comyn before the high altar the scotichronicon says that on being told that comyn had survived the attack and was being treated two of bruces supporters roger de kirkpatrick uttering the words i mak siccar i make sure and john lindsay went back into the church and finished bruces work barbour however tells no such story bruce asserted his claim to the scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of scotland bruce and his party then attacked dumfries castle where the english garrison surrendered bruce hurried from dumfries to glasgow where his friend and supporter bishop robert wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to bruce nonetheless bruce was excommunicated for this crime english records still in existence today tell a completely different story they state that the comyn murder was planned in an attempt to gain the throne of scotland for this reason king edward of england wrote to the pope and asked for his excommunication of robert bruce no records have ever been found in england stating that king edward had any knowledge of treachery by robert bruce before his acts against comyn they state that king edward did not hear of the murder of john comyn until several days after his deathcitation needed early reign –edit war of robert iedit bruce crowned king of scots modern tableau at edinburgh castle six weeks after comyn was killed in dumfries bruce was crowned king of scots by bishop william de lamberton at scone near perth on  march  with all formality and solemnity the royal robes and vestments that robert wishart had hidden from the english were brought out by the bishop and set upon king robert the bishops of moray and glasgow were in attendance as well as the earls of atholl menteith lennox and mar the great banner of the kings of scotland was planted behind his throne isabella macduff countess of buchan and wife of john comyn rd earl of buchan a cousin of the murdered john comyn arrived the next day too late for the coronation she claimed the right of her family the macduff earl of fife to crown the scottish king for her brother donnchadh iv earl of fife who was not yet of age and in english hands so a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of robert bruce earl of carrick lord of annandale king of the scots in june  bruce was defeated at the battle of methven his wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to kildrummy in august  under the protection of bruces brother neil bruce and the earl of atholl and most of his remaining men bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men including sir james douglas and gilbert hay bruces brothers thomas alexander and edward as well as sir neil campbell and the earl of lennox edward i marched north again in the spring on his way he granted the scottish estates of bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating bruce bruces queen elizabeth his daughter marjorie his sisters christina and mary and isabella macduff were captured in a sanctuary at tain and sent to harsh imprisonment which included mary and isabella being hung in cages at roxburgh and berwick castles respectively for about four years while bruces brother neil was executed by being hanged drawn and quartered on  july king edward i died leaving bruce opposed by the kings son edward ii bruce in jungle it is still uncertain where bruce spent the winter of – most likely he spent it in the hebrides possibly sheltered by christina of garmoran who was married to bruces brotherinlaw duncan the brother of bruces first wife isabella of mar ireland is also a serious possibility and orkney under norwegian rule at the time or norway proper where his sister isabel bruce was queen dowager although unlikely are not impossible bruce and his followers returned to the scottish mainland in february in two groups one led by bruce and his brother edward landed at turnberry castle and began a guerrilla war in southwest scotland the other led by his brothers thomas and alexander landed slightly further south in loch ryan but they were soon captured and executed in april bruce won a small victory over the english at the battle of glen trool before defeating aymer de valence nd earl of pembroke at the battle of loudoun hill at the same time james douglas made his first foray for bruce into southwestern scotland attacking and burning his own castle in douglasdale leaving his brother edward in command in galloway bruce travelled north capturing inverlochy and urquhart castles burning inverness castle and nairn to the ground then unsuccessfully threatening elgin transferring operations to aberdeenshire in late  he threatened banff before falling seriously ill probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign recovering leaving john comyn rd earl of buchan unsubdued at his rear bruce returned west to take balvenie and duffus castles then tarradale castle on the black isle looping back via the hinterlands of inverness and a second failed attempt to take elgin bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of comyn at the battle of inverurie in may  he then overran buchan and defeated the english garrison at aberdeen the harrying of buchan in  was ordered by bruce to make sure all comyn family support was extinguished buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern scotland and much of its population was loyal to the comyn family even after the defeat of the earl of buchan most of the comyn castles in moray aberdeen and buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed bruce ordered similar harryings in argyle and kintyre in the territories of clan macdougall with these acts bruce had successfully destroyed the power of the comyns which had controlled much of northern and southwestern scotland for over a hundred and fifty years he then crossed to argyll and defeated the macdougalls allies of the comyns at the battle of pass of brander and took dunstaffnage castle the last major stronghold of the comyns in march  bruce held his first parliament at st andrews and by august he controlled all of scotland north of the river tay the following year the clergy of scotland recognised bruce as king at a general council the support given to him by the church in spite of his excommunication was of great political importance on the  october  bruce wrote to edward ii of england from kildrum in cumbernauld parish trying unsuccessfully to establish peace between scotland and england over the next three years one englishheld castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced linlithgow in  dumbarton in  and perth by bruce himself in january  bruce also made raids into northern england and landing at ramsey in the isle of man then laid siege to castle rushen in castletown capturing it on  june  and denying the islands strategic importance to the english the eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the english on even ground have caused many to consider bruce as one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age this represented a transformation for one raised as a feudal knight battle of bannockburnedit depiction of the battle of bannockburn in  from the holkham bible main article battle of bannockburn by  robert i had recaptured most of the castles in scotland once held by the english and was sending raiding parties into northern england as far as carlisle in response edward ii planned a major military campaign with the support of lancaster and the barons mustering a large army between  and  strong in the spring of  edward bruce laid siege to stirling castle a key fortification in scotland whose governor philip de mowbray agreed to capitulate if not relieved before  june  in march james douglas captured roxburgh and randolph captured edinburgh castle while in may bruce again raided england and subdued the isle of man news of the agreement regarding stirling castle reached the english king in late may and he decided to speed up his march north from berwick to relieve the castle robert with between  and  troops predominantly spearmen prepared to prevent edwards forces from reaching stirling the battle began on  june as the english army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the bannock burn which was surrounded by marshland skirmishing between the two sides broke out resulting in the death of sir henry de bohun whom robert killed in personal combat edward continued his advance the following day and encountered the bulk of the scottish army as they emerged from the woods of new park the english appear not to have expected the scots to give battle here and as a result had kept their forces in marching rather than battle order with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − at the back of the army rather than the front the english cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by roberts spearmen the english army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control edward ii was dragged away from the battlefield hotly pursued by the scottish forces and only just escaped the heavy fighting the historian roy haines describes the defeat as a calamity of stunning proportions for the english whose losses in the battle were huge in the aftermath of the defeat edward retreated to dunbar then travelled by ship to berwick and then back to york in his absence stirling castle quickly fell midreign –edit bruce reviewing troops before the battle of bannockburn further confrontation with england then the irish conflictedit main article bruce campaign in ireland freed from english threats scotlands armies could now invade northern england bruce also drove back a subsequent english expedition north of the border and launched raids into yorkshire and lancashire buoyed by his military successes bruces forces also invaded ireland in  purportedly to free the country from english rule having received a reply to offers of assistance from donal oneil king of tyrone and to open a second front in the continuing wars with england the irish even crowned edward bruce as high king of ireland in  robert later went there with another army to assist his brother in conjunction with the invasion bruce popularised an ideological vision of a pangaelic greater scotia with his lineage ruling over both ireland and scotland this propaganda campaign was aided by two factors the first was his marriage alliance from  with the de burgh family of the earldom of ulster in ireland second bruce himself on his mothers side of carrick was descended from gaelic royalty in scotland as well as ireland bruces irish ancestors included eva of leinster d whose ancestors included brian boru of munster and the kings of leinster thus lineally and geopolitically bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pangaelic alliance between scottishirish gaelic populations under his kingship this is revealed by a letter he sent to the irish chiefs where he calls the scots and irish collectively nostra nacio our nation stressing the common language customs and heritage of the two peoples whereas we and you and our people and your people free since ancient times share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom we have sent you our beloved kinsman the bearers of this letter to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you so that with gods will our nation nostra nacio may be able to recover her ancient liberty the diplomacy worked to a certain extent at least in ulster where the scots had some support the irish chief donal oneil for instance later justified his support for the scots to pope john xxii by saying the kings of lesser scotia all trace their blood to our greater scotia and retain to some degree our language and customs the bruce campaign in ireland was characterised by some initial military success however the scots failed to win over the nonulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island where people couldnt see the difference between english and scottish occupation eventually it was defeated when edward bruce was killed at the battle of faughart the irish annals of the period described the defeat of the bruces by the english as one of the greatest things ever done for the irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the irish by both the scots and the english later reign –edit the tyninghame copy of the declaration of arbroath the reign of robert bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements the declaration of arbroath of  strengthened his position particularly visàvis the papacy and pope john xxii eventually lifted bruces excommunication in may  king edward iii of england signed the treaty of edinburghnorthampton which recognised scotland as an independent kingdom and bruce as its king in  robert i exchanged lands at cardross for those of old montrose in angus with sir david graham it was to be here that robert would build the manor house that would serve as his favoured residence during the final years of his reign the extant chamberlains accounts for  detail a manor house at cardross with kings and queens chambers and glazed windows a chapel kitchens bake and brewhouses falcon aviary medicinal garden gatehouse protective moat and a hunting park there was also a jetty and beaching area for the kings coble for fishing alongside the kings great shipnb  as most of mainland scotlands major royal castles had remained in their razed state since around – cardross manor was perhaps built as a modest residence sympathetic to roberts subjects privations through a long war repeated famines and livestock pandemics before cardross became habitable in  robert is main residence had been scone abbey robert i had been suffering from a serious illness from at least  the lanercost chronicle and scalacronica state that the king was said to have contracted and died of leprosy jean le bel also stated that in  the king was a victim of la grosse maladie which is usually taken to mean leprosy however the ignorant use of the term leprosy by fourteenthcentury writers meant that almost any major skin disease might be called leprosy the earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eyewitness in ulster at the time the king made a truce with sir henry mandeville on  july  the writer of this letter reported that robert i was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue barbour writes of the kings illness that it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying during the months of wandering from  to  it has been proposed that alternatively he may have suffered from eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or a series of strokes there does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be nor is there any evidence of an attempt in his last years to segregate the king in any way from the company of friends family courtiers or foreign diplomats in october  the pope finally lifted the interdict from scotland and the excommunication of robert i the kings last journey appears to have been a pilgrimage to the shrine of saint ninian at whithorn this was possibly in search of a miraculous cure or to make his peace with god with moray by his side robert set off from his manor at cardross for tarbert on his great ship thence to the isle of arran where he celebrated christmas of  at the hall of glenkill near lamlash thence he sailed to the mainland to visit his son and his bride both mere children now installed at turnberry castle the head of the earldom of carrick and once his own main residence he journeyed overland being carried on a litter to inch in wigtownshire houses were built there and supplies brought to that place as though the kings condition had deteriorated at the end of march  he was staying at glenluce abbey and at monreith from where st ninians cave was visited early in april he arrived at the shrine of st ninian at whithorn he fasted four or five days and prayed to the saint before returning by sea to cardross barbour and other sources relate that robert summoned his prelates and barons to his bedside for a final council at which he made copious gifts to religious houses dispensed silver to religious foundations of various orders so that they might pray for his soul and repented of his failure to fulfil a vow to undertake a crusade to fight the saracens in the holy land roberts final wish reflected conventional piety and was perhaps intended to perpetuate his memory after his death his heart was to be removed from his body and accompanied by a company of knights led by sir james douglas taken on pilgrimage to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem before being interred in melrose abbey upon its return from the holy land i will that as soone as i am trespassed out of this worlde that ye take my harte owte of my body and embawme it

abbey death edit death and aftermathedit king robert i is buried in dunfermline abbey robert died on  june  at the manor of cardross near dumbarton apart from failing to fulfill a vow to undertake a crusade he died utterly fulfilled in that the goal of his lifetimes struggle—untrammelled recognition of the bruce right to the crown—had been realised and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant moray until his infant son reached adulthood six days after his death to complete his triumph still further papal bulls were issued granting the privilege of unction at the coronation of future kings of scots it remains unclear just what caused the death of robert i a month before his fiftyfifth birthday contemporary accusations that robert suffered from leprosy the unclean sickness—the presentday treatable hansens disease—derived from english and hainault chroniclers none of the scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy penman states that it is very difficult to accept the notion of robert as a functioning king serving in war performing facetoface acts of lordship holding parliament and court travelling widely and fathering several children all while displaying the infectious symptoms of a leper along with suggestions of eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or stroke a diet of rich court food has also been suggested as a possible contributory factor in roberts death his milanese physician maino de maineri did criticise the kings eating of eels as dangerous to his health in advancing years a team of researchers headed by professor andrew nelson from university of western ontario have determined that robert the bruce did not have leprosy during his lifetime they examined the original casting of the skull belonging to robert the bruces descendant lord andrew douglas alexander thomas bruce and a foot bone that had not been reinterned they determined that skull and foot bone showed no signs of leprosy such as an eroded nasal spine and a pencilling of the foot bone burialedit the kings body was embalmed at cardross and his sternum was sawn open to allow extraction of the

cardross the ruins of which are located in the presentday levengrove park in dumbarton the kings body was carried east from cardross by a carriage decked in black lawn cloth with stops recorded at dunipace and cambuskenneth abbey the funeral was a grand affair with  stone  kg of wax having been purchased for the making of funerary candles a file of mourners on foot including robert stewart and a number of knights dressed in black gowns accompanied the funeral party into dunfermline abbey a canopy chapel or hearse of imported baltic wood was erected over the grave robert is body in a wooden coffin was then interred within a stone vault beneath the floor underneath a box tomb of white italian marble purchased in paris by thomas of chartres after june  a plinth of black fossiliferous limestone from frosterley topped this structure and atop this plinth was a white alabaster effigy of robert i painted and gilded the following latin epitaph was inscribed around the top of the tomb hic jacet invictus robertus rex benedictus qui sua gesta legit repetit quot bella peregit ad libertatem perduxit per probitatem regnum scottorum nunc vivat in arce polorum here lies the invincible blessed king robert  whoever reads about his feats will repeat the many battles he fought  by his integrity he guided to liberty the kingdom of the scots may he now live in heaven ten alabaster fragments from the tomb are on display in the national museum of scotland and traces of gilding still remain on some of them robert had bequeathed sufficient funds to pay for thousands of obituary masses in dunfermline abbey and elsewhere and his tomb would thus be the site of daily votive prayers when a projected international crusade failed to materialise sir james douglas and his company escorting the casket containing bruces heart sailed to spain where alfonso xi of castile was mounting a campaign against the moorish kingdom of granada according to john barbour douglas and his companions including sir william de keith sir simon locard sir william de st clair of rosslyn and the brothers sir robert logan of restalrig and sir walter logan were welcomed cordially by king alfonso in august  the scots contingent formed part of the castilian army besieging the frontier castle of teba under circumstances which are still disputed sir james and most of his companions were killed the sources all agree that outnumbered and separated from the main christian army a group of scots knights led by douglas was overwhelmed and wiped out the surviving members including sir simon locard of the company recovered douglas body together with the casket containing bruces heart the heart together with douglas bones were brought back to scotland in accordance with bruces written request the heart was buried at melrose abbey in roxburghshire in  the heart was discovered by archaeologists and was reburied but the location was not marked in  a casket was unearthed during

parish church to be built on the site of the eastern choir of dunfermline abbey uncovered a vault before the site of the former abbey high altar the vault was covered by two large flat stones—one forming a headstone and a larger stone six feet  cm in length with six iron rings or handles set in it when these stones were removed the vault was found to be seven feet  cm in length  cm wide and  cm deep within the vault inside the remnants of a decayed oak coffin there was a body entirely enclosed in lead with a decayed shroud of cloth of gold over it over the head of the body the lead was formed into the shape of a crown fragments of marble and alabaster had been found in the debris around the site of the vault several years earlier which were linked to robert the bruces recorded purchase of a marble and alabaster tomb made in paris the barons of exchequer ordered that the vault was to be secured from all further inspection with new stones and iron bars and guarded by the town constables and that once the walls of the new church were built up around the site an investigation of the vault and the remains could take place accordingly on  november  the investigation took place the cloth of gold shroud and the lead covering were found to be in a rapid state of decay since the vault had first been opened  months earlier the body was raised up and placed on a wooden coffin board on the edge of the vault it was found to be covered in two thin layers of lead each around  mm thick the lead was removed and the skeleton was inspected by james gregory and alexander monro professor of anatomy at the university of edinburgh the sternum was found to have been sawn open from top to bottom permitting removal of the kings heart after death a plaster cast was taken of the detached skull by artist william scoular the bones were measured and drawn and the kings skeleton was measured to be  feet  inches  cm it has been estimated that bruce may have stood at around  feet  inch  cm tall as a young man which by medieval standards was impressive at this height he would have stood almost as tall as edward i  feet  inches  cm the skeleton lying on the wooden coffin board was then placed upon the top of a lead coffin and the large crowd of curious people who had assembled outside the church were allowed to file past the vault to view the kings remains it was at this point in the proceedings that some small relics—teeth and finger bones—were allegedly removed from the skeleton the published accounts of eyewitnesses such as henry jardine and james gregory confirm the removal of small objects at this time robert the bruces remains were ceremonially reinterred in the vault in dunfermline abbey on  november  they were placed in a new lead coffin into which was

north coast of ireland where he observed a spider spinning a web trying to make a connection from one area of the caves roof to another it tried and failed twice but began again and succeeded on the third attempt inspired by this bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the english thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory the story serves to illustrate the maxim if at first you dont succeed try try try again other versions have bruce in a small house watching the spider try to make its connection between two roof beams this legend first appears in a much later account tales of a grandfather by sir walter scottcitation needed and may have originally been told about his companioninarms sir james douglas the black douglas who had spent time hiding out in caves within his manor of lintalee which was then occupied by the english the entire account may in fact be a version of a literary trope used in royal biographical writing a similar story is told for example in jewish sources about king david and in persian folklore about the mongolian warlord tamerlane and an ant it is said that before the battle of bannockburn bruce was attacked by the english knight sir henry de bohun riding with the heavy cavalry de bohun caught sight of bruce who was armed only with his battleaxe de bohun lowered his lance and charged and bruce stood his ground at the last moment bruce swiftly dodged the lance raised in his saddle and with one mighty swing of his axe struck bohun so hard that he split his iron helmet and his head in two so powerful that it shattered the very weapon into pieces afterwards the king merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe to this day the story stands in folklore as a testament of the scottish people and

during the first war of scottish independence against england he fought successfully during his reign to regain scotlands place as an independent country and is today revered in scotland as a national hero descended from the anglonorman and gaelic nobilities his paternal fourthgreat grandfather was king david i roberts grandfather robert de brus th lord of annandale was one of the claimants to the scottish throne during the great cause as earl of carrick robert the bruce supported his familys claim to the scottish throne and took part in william wallaces revolt against edward i of england appointed in  as a guardian of scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne john comyn lord of badenoch and william lamberton bishop of st andrews robert later resigned in  due to his quarrels with comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of king john balliol after submitting to edward i in  and returning to the kings peace robert inherited his familys claim to the scottish throne upon his fathers death in february  robert the bruce killed comyn following an argument and was excommunicated by the pope although he received absolution from robert wishart bishop of glasgow bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of scots on  march  edward is forces defeated robert in battle forcing him to flee into hiding in the hebrides and ireland before returning in  to defeat an english army at loudoun hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the english bruce defeated his other scots enemies destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands and in  held his first parliament a series of military victories between  and  won him control of much of scotland and at the battle of bannockburn in  robert defeated a much larger english army under edward ii of england confirming the reestablishment of an independent scottish kingdom the battle marked a significant turning point with roberts armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern england while also extending his war against the english to ireland by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the native irish to rise against edward iis rule despite bannockburn and the capture of the final english stronghold at berwick in  edward ii refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of scotland in  the scottish nobility submitted the declaration of arbroath to pope john xxii declaring robert as their rightful monarch and asserting scotlands status as an independent kingdom in  the pope recognised robert i as king of an independent scotland and in  the francoscottish alliance was renewed in the treaty of corbeil in  the english deposed edward ii in favour of his son edward iii and peace was concluded between scotland and england with the treaty of

line arrived in scotland with david i in  and was given the lands of annandale in dumfries and galloway robert i was one of the ten children and the eldest son of robert de brus th lord of annandale and marjorie countess of carrick and claimed the scottish throne as a fourth greatgrandson of david i his mother was by all accounts a formidable woman who legend would have it kept robert bruces father captive until he agreed to marry her from his mother he inherited the earldom of carrick and through his father a royal lineage that would give him a claim to the scottish throne the bruces also held substantial estates in aberdeenshire county antrim county durham essex middlesex and yorkshire early life –edit birthedit the remains of turnberry castle robert the bruces likely birthplace although robert the bruces date of birth is known his place of birth is less certain although it is most likely to have been turnberry castle in ayrshire the head of his mothers earldomnb  childhoodedit very little is known of his youth he was probably brought up in a mixture of the anglonorman culture of northern england and southeastern scotland and the gaelic culture of southwest scotland and most of scotland north of the river forth annandale was thoroughly feudalised and the form of northern middle english that would later develop into the scots language was spoken throughout the region carrick was historically an integral part of galloway and though the earls of carrick had achieved some feudalisation the society of carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically celtic and gaelic speaking robert the bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age he would have been schooled to speak read and possibly write in the anglonorman language of his scotsnorman peers and his fathers family he would also have spoken both the gaelic language of his carrick birthplace and his mothers family and the early scots language as the heir to a considerable estate and a pious layman robert would also have been given working knowledge of latin the language of charter lordship liturgy and prayer this would have afforded robert and his brothers access to basic education in the law politics scripture saints lives vitae philosophy history and chivalric instruction and romance that robert took personal pleasure in such learning and leisure is suggested in a number of ways barbour reported that robert read aloud to his band of supporters in  reciting from memory tales from a twelfthcentury romance of charlemagne fierabras as well as relating examples from history such as hannibals defiance of rome as king robert certainly commissioned verse to commemorate bannockburn and his subjects military deeds contemporary chroniclers jean le bel and thomas grey would both assert that they had read a history of his reign commissioned by king robert himself in his last years robert would pay for dominican friars to tutor his son david for whom he would also purchase books a parliamentary briefing document of c would also assert that robert used continually to read or have read in his presence the histories of ancient kings and princes and how they conducted themselves in their times both in wartime and in peacetime from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule tutors for the young robert and his brothers were most likely drawn from unbeneficed clergy or mendicant friars associated with the churches patronised by their family however as growing noble youths outdoor pursuits and great events would also have held a strong fascination for robert and his brothers they would have had masters drawn from their parents household to school them in the arts of horsemanship swordsmanship the joust hunting and perhaps aspects of courtly behaviour including dress protocol speech table etiquette music and dance some of which may have been learned before the age of ten while serving as pages in their fathers or grandfathers household as many of these personal and leadership skills were bound up within a code of chivalry roberts chief tutor was surely a reputable experienced knight drawn from his grandfathers crusade retinue this grandfather known to contemporaries as robert the noble and to history as bruce the competitor seems to have been an immense influence on the future king roberts later performance in war certainly underlines his skills in tactics and single combat the family would have moved between the castles of their lordships—lochmaben castle the main castle of the lordship of annandale and turnberry and loch doon castle the castles of the earldom of carrick a significant and profound part of the childhood experience of robert edward and possibly the other bruce brothers neil thomas and alexander was also gained through the gaelic tradition of being fostered to allied gaelic kindreds—a traditional practice in carrick southwest and western scotland the hebrides and ireland there were a number of carrick ayrshire hebridean and irish families and kindreds affiliated with the bruces who might have performed such a service roberts fosterbrother is referred to by barbour as sharing roberts precarious existence as an outlaw in carrick in – this gaelic influence has been cited as a possible explanation for robert the bruces apparent affinity for hobelar warfare using smaller sturdy ponies in mounted raids as well as for seapower ranging from oared wargalleys birlinns to boats according to historians such as barrow and penman it is also likely that when robert and edward bruce reached the male age of consent of twelve and began training for full knighthood they were sent to reside for a period with one or more allied english noble families such as the de clares of gloucester or perhaps even in the english royal household sir thomas grey asserted in his scalacronica that in about  robert the bruce then aged eighteen was a young bachelor of king edwards chamber while there remains little firm evidence of roberts presence at edwards court on  april  both robert and his father were pursued through the english chancery for their private household debts of £ by several merchants of winchester this raises the possibility that young robert the bruce was on occasion resident in a royal centre which edward i himself would visit frequently during his reign roberts first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by alexander og macdonald lord of islay his name appears in the company of the bishop of argyll the vicar of arran a kintyre clerk his father and a host of gaelic notaries from carrick robert bruce the king to be was sixteen years of age when margaret maid of norway died in  it is also around this time that robert would have been knighted and he began to appear on the political stage in the bruce dynastic interest the great causeedit roberts mother died early in  in november of the same year edward i of england on behalf of the guardians of scotland and following the great cause awarded the vacant crown of scotland to his grandfathers first cousin once removed john balliol almost immediately robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his lordship of annandale and transferred his claim to the scottish throne to his son antedating this statement to  november in turn that son robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his earldom of carrick to his eldest son robert the future king so as to protect the bruces kingship claim while their middle lord robert the bruces father now held only english lands while the bruces bid for the throne had ended in failure the balliols triumph propelled the eighteenyearold robert the bruce onto the political stage in his own right earl of carrick –edit the bruces regroupedit robert the bruce and isabella of mar as depicted in the  forman armorial even after johns accession edward still continued to assert his authority over scotland and relations between the two kings soon began to deteriorate the bruces sided with king edward against king john and his comyn allies robert the bruce and his father both considered john a usurper against the objections of the scots edward i agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of the guardians that had governed scotland during the interregnum a further provocation came in a case brought by macduff son of malcolm earl of fife in which edward demanded that john appear in person before the english parliament to answer the charges this the scottish king did but the final straw was edwards demand that the scottish magnates provide military service in englands war against france this was unacceptable the scots instead formed an alliance with france the comyndominated council acting in the name of king john summoned the scottish host to meet at caddonlee on  march the bruces and the earls of angus and march refused and the bruce family withdrew temporarily from scotland while the comyns seized their estates in annandale and carrick granting them to john comyn earl of buchan edward i thereupon provided a safe refuge for the bruces having appointed the lord of annandale to the command of carlisle castle in october  at some point in early  robert married his first wife isabella of mar the daughter of domhnall i earl of mar and his wife helen beginning of the wars of independenceedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message almost the first blow in the war between scotland and england was a direct attack on the bruces on  march  easter monday seven scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of carlisle which was not so much an attack against england as the comyn earl of buchan and their faction attacking their bruce enemies both his father and grandfather were at one time governors of the castle and following the loss of annandale to comyn in  it was their principal residence robert bruce would have gained firsthand knowledge of the citys defences the next time carlisle was besieged in  robert the bruce would be leading the attack edward i responded to king johns alliance with france and the attack on carlisle by invading scotland at the end of march  and taking the town of berwick in a particularly bloody attack upon the flimsy palisades at the battle of dunbar scottish resistance was effectively crushed edward deposed king john placed him in the tower of london and installed englishmen to govern the country the campaign had been very successful but the english triumph would only be temporary although the bruces were by now back in possession of annandale and carrick in august  robert bruce lord of annandale and his son robert bruce earl of carrick and future king were among the more than  scots at berwick who swore an oath of fealty to king edward i of england when the scottish revolt against edward i broke out in july  james stewart th high steward of scotland led into rebellion a group of disaffected scots including robert wishart bishop of glasgow macduff the son of the earl of fife and the young robert bruce the future king was now twentytwo and in joining the rebels he seems to have been acting independently of his father who took no part in the rebellion and appears to have abandoned annandale once more for the safety of carlisle it appears that robert bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfathers friends wishart and stewart who had inspired him to resistance with the outbreak of the revolt robert left carlisle and made his way to annandale where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and according to the english chronicler walter of guisborough addressed them thus no man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and i am no exception i must join my own people and the nation in which i was born i ask that you please come with me and you will be my councillors and close comrades urgent letters were sent ordering bruce to support edwards commander john de warenne th earl of surrey to whom bruce was related in the summer of  but instead of complying bruce continued to support the revolt against edward i that bruce was in the forefront of fomenting rebellion is shown in a letter written to edward by hugh cressingham on  july  which reports the opinion that if you had the earl of carrick the steward of scotland and his brotheryou would think your business done on  july bruce and his friends made terms with edward by a treaty called the capitulation of irvine the scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to king edward the bishop of glasgow james the steward and sir alexander lindsay became sureties for bruce until he delivered his infant daughter marjorie as a hostage which he never did when king edward returned to england after his victory at the battle of falkirk the bruces possessions were excepted from the lordships and lands that edward assigned to his followers the reason for this is uncertain though fordun records robert fighting for edward at falkirk under the command of antony bek bishop of durham annandale and carrick this participation is contested as no bruce appears on the falkirk roll of nobles present in the english army and two th century antiquarians alexander murison and george chalmers have stated bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste annandale and burn ayr castle to prevent it being garrisoned by the english guardianedit william wallace resigned as guardian of scotland after his defeat at the battle of falkirk he was succeeded by robert bruce and john comyn as joint guardians but they could not see past their personal differences as a nephew and supporter of king john and as someone with a serious claim to the scottish throne comyn was bruces enemy in  william lamberton bishop of st andrews was appointed as a third neutral guardian to try to maintain order between bruce and comyn the following year bruce finally resigned as joint guardian and was replaced by sir gilbert de umfraville earl of angus in may  umfraville comyn and lamberton also resigned as joint guardians and were replaced by sir john de soules as sole guardian soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the bruce nor the comyn camps and was a patriot he was an active guardian and made renewed efforts to have king john returned to the scottish throne in july  king edward i launched his sixth campaign into scotland though he captured the castles of bothwell and turnberry he did little to damage the scots fighting ability and in january  he agreed to a ninemonth truce it was around this time that robert the bruce submitted to edward along with other nobles even though he had been on the side of the scots until then there were rumours that john balliol would return to regain the scottish throne soules who had probably been appointed by john supported his return as did most other nobles but it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it in march  bruce sent a letter to the monks at melrose abbey apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national callup bruce pledged that henceforth he would never again require the monks to serve unless it was to the common army of the whole realm for national defence bruce also married his second wife that year elizabeth de burgh the daughter of richard de burgh nd earl of ulster by elizabeth he had four children david ii john died in childhood matilda who married thomas isaac and died at aberdeen  july  and margaret who married william de moravia th earl of sutherland in  in  edward invaded again reaching edinburgh before marching to perth edward stayed in perth until july then proceeded via dundee brechin and montrose to aberdeen where he arrived in august from there he marched through moray to badenoch before retracing his path back south to dunfermline with the country now under submission all the leading scots except for william wallace surrendered to edward in february  john comyn who was by now guardian submitted to edward the laws and liberties of scotland were to be as they had been in the days of alexander iii and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of king edward and the advice of the scots nobles on  june  bruce and william lamberton made a pact that bound them each to the other in friendship and alliance against all men if one should break the secret pact he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds the pact is often interpretedby whom as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the english homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the english parliament to establish rules for the governance of scotland the earl of richmond edwards nephew was to head up the subordinate government of scotland while all this took place william wallace was finally captured near glasgow and he was hanged drawn and quartered in london on  august  in september  edward ordered robert bruce to put his castle at kildrummy in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for suggesting that king edward suspected robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back however an identical phrase appears in an agreement between edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend aymer de valence a further sign of edwards distrust occurred on  october  when edward revoked his gift of sir gilbert de umfravilles lands to bruce that he had made only six months before robert bruce as earl of carrick and now th lord of annandale held huge estates and property in scotland and a barony and some minor properties in england and a strong claim to the scottish throne murder of john comynedit the killing of comyn in the greyfriars church in dumfries as imagined by felix philippoteaux a thcentury illustrator bruce like all his family had a complete belief in his right to the throne however his actions of supporting alternately the english and scottish armies had led to a great deal of distrust towards bruce among the community of the realm of scotland his ambition was further thwarted by john comyn who had been much more resolute in his opposition to the english comyn was the most powerful noble in scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within scotland and england including relatives that held the earldoms of buchan mar ross fife angus dunbar and strathearn the lordships of kilbride kirkintilloch lenzie bedrule and scraesburgh and sheriffdoms in banff dingwall wigtown and aberdeen he also had a powerful claim to the scottish throne through his descent from donald iii on his fathers side and david i on his mothers side comyn was the nephew of john balliol according to barbour and fordoun in the late summer of  in a secret agreement sworn signed and sealed john comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the scottish throne in favour of robert bruce upon receipt of the bruce lands in scotland should an uprising occur led by bruce whether the details of the agreement with comyn are correct or not king edward moved to arrest bruce while bruce was still at the english court fortunately for bruce his friend and edwards soninlaw ralph de monthermer learnt of edwards intention and warned bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs bruce took the hint and he and a squire fled the english court during the night they made their way quickly for scotland according to barbour comyn betrayed his agreement with bruce to king edward i and when bruce arranged a meeting for  february  with comyn in the chapel of greyfriars monastery in dumfries and accused him of treachery they came to blows bruce stabbed comyn before the high altar the scotichronicon says that on being told that comyn had survived the attack and was being treated two of bruces supporters roger de kirkpatrick uttering the words i mak siccar i make sure and john lindsay went back into the church and finished bruces work barbour however tells no such story bruce asserted his claim to the scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of scotland bruce and his party then attacked dumfries castle where the english garrison surrendered bruce hurried from dumfries to glasgow where his friend and supporter bishop robert wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to bruce nonetheless bruce was excommunicated for this crime english records still in existence today tell a completely different story they state that the comyn murder was planned in an attempt to gain the throne of scotland for this reason king edward of england wrote to the pope and asked for his excommunication of robert bruce no records have ever been found in england stating that king edward had any knowledge of treachery by robert bruce before his acts against comyn they state that king edward did not hear of the murder of john comyn until several days after his deathcitation needed early reign –edit war of robert iedit bruce crowned king of scots modern tableau at edinburgh castle six weeks after comyn was killed in dumfries bruce was crowned king of scots by bishop william de lamberton at scone near perth on  march  with all formality and solemnity the royal robes and vestments that robert wishart had hidden from the english were brought out by the bishop and set upon king robert the bishops of moray and glasgow were in attendance as well as the earls of atholl menteith lennox and mar the great banner of the kings of scotland was planted behind his throne isabella macduff countess of buchan and wife of john comyn rd earl of buchan a cousin of the murdered john comyn arrived the next day too late for the coronation she claimed the right of her family the macduff earl of fife to crown the scottish king for her brother donnchadh iv earl of fife who was not yet of age and in english hands so a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of robert bruce earl of carrick lord of annandale king of the scots in june  bruce was defeated at the battle of methven his wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to kildrummy in august  under the protection of bruces brother neil bruce and the earl of atholl and most of his remaining men bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men including sir james douglas and gilbert hay bruces brothers thomas alexander and edward as well as sir neil campbell and the earl of lennox edward i marched north again in the spring on his way he granted the scottish estates of bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating bruce bruces queen elizabeth his daughter marjorie his sisters christina and mary and isabella macduff were captured in a sanctuary at tain and sent to harsh imprisonment which included mary and isabella being hung in cages at roxburgh and berwick castles respectively for about four years while bruces brother neil was executed by being hanged drawn and quartered on  july king edward i died leaving bruce opposed by the kings son edward ii bruce in jungle it is still uncertain where bruce spent the winter of – most likely he spent it in the hebrides possibly sheltered by christina of garmoran who was married to bruces brotherinlaw duncan the brother of bruces first wife isabella of mar ireland is also a serious possibility and orkney under norwegian rule at the time or norway proper where his sister isabel bruce was queen dowager although unlikely are not impossible bruce and his followers returned to the scottish mainland in february in two groups one led by bruce and his brother edward landed at turnberry castle and began a guerrilla war in southwest scotland the other led by his brothers thomas and alexander landed slightly further south in loch ryan but they were soon captured and executed in april bruce won a small victory over the english at the battle of glen trool before defeating aymer de valence nd earl of pembroke at the battle of loudoun hill at the same time james douglas made his first foray for bruce into southwestern scotland attacking and burning his own castle in douglasdale leaving his brother edward in command in galloway bruce travelled north capturing inverlochy and urquhart castles burning inverness castle and nairn to the ground then unsuccessfully threatening elgin transferring operations to aberdeenshire in late  he threatened banff before falling seriously ill probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign recovering leaving john comyn rd earl of buchan unsubdued at his rear bruce returned west to take balvenie and duffus castles then tarradale castle on the black isle looping back via the hinterlands of inverness and a second failed attempt to take elgin bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of comyn at the battle of inverurie in may  he then overran buchan and defeated the english garrison at aberdeen the harrying of buchan in  was ordered by bruce to make sure all comyn family support was extinguished buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern scotland and much of its population was loyal to the comyn family even after the defeat of the earl of buchan most of the comyn castles in moray aberdeen and buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed bruce ordered similar harryings in argyle and kintyre in the territories of clan macdougall with these acts bruce had successfully destroyed the power of the comyns which had controlled much of northern and southwestern scotland for over a hundred and fifty years he then crossed to argyll and defeated the macdougalls allies of the comyns at the battle of pass of brander and took dunstaffnage castle the last major stronghold of the comyns in march  bruce held his first parliament at st andrews and by august he controlled all of scotland north of the river tay the following year the clergy of scotland recognised bruce as king at a general council the support given to him by the church in spite of his excommunication was of great political importance on the  october  bruce wrote to edward ii of england from kildrum in cumbernauld parish trying unsuccessfully to establish peace between scotland and england over the next three years one englishheld castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced linlithgow in  dumbarton in  and perth by bruce himself in january  bruce also made raids into northern england and landing at ramsey in the isle of man then laid siege to castle rushen in castletown capturing it on  june  and denying the islands strategic importance to the english the eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the english on even ground have caused many to consider bruce as one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age this represented a transformation for one raised as a feudal knight battle of bannockburnedit depiction of the battle of bannockburn in  from the holkham bible main article battle of bannockburn by  robert i had recaptured most of the castles in scotland once held by the english and was sending raiding parties into northern england as far as carlisle in response edward ii planned a major military campaign with the support of lancaster and the barons mustering a large army between  and  strong in the spring of  edward bruce laid siege to stirling castle a key fortification in scotland whose governor philip de mowbray agreed to capitulate if not relieved before  june  in march james douglas captured roxburgh and randolph captured edinburgh castle while in may bruce again raided england and subdued the isle of man news of the agreement regarding stirling castle reached the english king in late may and he decided to speed up his march north from berwick to relieve the castle robert with between  and  troops predominantly spearmen prepared to prevent edwards forces from reaching stirling the battle began on  june as the english army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the bannock burn which was surrounded by marshland skirmishing between the two sides broke out resulting in the death of sir henry de bohun whom robert killed in personal combat edward continued his advance the following day and encountered the bulk of the scottish army as they emerged from the woods of new park the english appear not to have expected the scots to give battle here and as a result had kept their forces in marching rather than battle order with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − at the back of the army rather than the front the english cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by roberts spearmen the english army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control edward ii was dragged away from the battlefield hotly pursued by the scottish forces and only just escaped the heavy fighting the historian roy haines describes the defeat as a calamity of stunning proportions for the english whose losses in the battle were huge in the aftermath of the defeat edward retreated to dunbar then travelled by ship to berwick and then back to york in his absence stirling castle quickly fell midreign –edit bruce reviewing troops before the battle of bannockburn further confrontation with england then the irish conflictedit main article bruce campaign in ireland freed from english threats scotlands armies could now invade northern england bruce also drove back a subsequent english expedition north of the border and launched raids into yorkshire and lancashire buoyed by his military successes bruces forces also invaded ireland in  purportedly to free the country from english rule having received a reply to offers of assistance from donal oneil king of tyrone and to open a second front in the continuing wars with england the irish even crowned edward bruce as high king of ireland in  robert later went there with another army to assist his brother in conjunction with the invasion bruce popularised an ideological vision of a pangaelic greater scotia with his lineage ruling over both ireland and scotland this propaganda campaign was aided by two factors the first was his marriage alliance from  with the de burgh family of the earldom of ulster in ireland second bruce himself on his mothers side of carrick was descended from gaelic royalty in scotland as well as ireland bruces irish ancestors included eva of leinster d whose ancestors included brian boru of munster and the kings of leinster thus lineally and geopolitically bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pangaelic alliance between scottishirish gaelic populations under his kingship this is revealed by a letter he sent to the irish chiefs where he calls the scots and irish collectively nostra nacio our nation stressing the common language customs and heritage of the two peoples whereas we and you and our people and your people free since ancient times share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom we have sent you our beloved kinsman the bearers of this letter to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you so that with gods will our nation nostra nacio may be able to recover her ancient liberty the diplomacy worked to a certain extent at least in ulster where the scots had some support the irish chief donal oneil for instance later justified his support for the scots to pope john xxii by saying the kings of lesser scotia all trace their blood to our greater scotia and retain to some degree our language and customs the bruce campaign in ireland was characterised by some initial military success however the scots failed to win over the nonulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island where people couldnt see the difference between english and scottish occupation eventually it was defeated when edward bruce was killed at the battle of faughart the irish annals of the period described the defeat of the bruces by the english as one of the greatest things ever done for the irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the irish by both the scots and the english later reign –edit the tyninghame copy of the declaration of arbroath the reign of robert bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements the declaration of arbroath of  strengthened his position particularly visàvis the papacy and pope john xxii eventually lifted bruces excommunication in may  king edward iii of england signed the treaty of edinburghnorthampton which recognised scotland as an independent kingdom and bruce as its king in  robert i exchanged lands at cardross for those of old montrose in angus with sir david graham it was to be here that robert would build the manor house that would serve as his favoured residence during the final years of his reign the extant chamberlains accounts for  detail a manor house at cardross with kings and queens chambers and glazed windows a chapel kitchens bake and brewhouses falcon aviary medicinal garden gatehouse protective moat and a hunting park there was also a jetty and beaching area for the kings coble for fishing alongside the kings great shipnb  as most of mainland scotlands major royal castles had remained in their razed state since around – cardross manor was perhaps built as a modest residence sympathetic to roberts subjects privations through a long war repeated famines and livestock pandemics before cardross became habitable in  robert is main residence had been scone abbey robert i had been suffering from a serious illness from at least  the lanercost chronicle and scalacronica state that the king was said to have contracted and died of leprosy jean le bel also stated that in  the king was a victim of la grosse maladie which is usually taken to mean leprosy however the ignorant use of the term leprosy by fourteenthcentury writers meant that almost any major skin disease might be called leprosy the earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eyewitness in ulster at the time the king made a truce with sir henry mandeville on  july  the writer of this letter reported that robert i was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue barbour writes of the kings illness that it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying during the months of wandering from  to  it has been proposed that alternatively he may have suffered from eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or a series of strokes there does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be nor is there any evidence of an attempt in his last years to segregate the king in any way from the company of friends family courtiers or foreign diplomats in october  the pope finally lifted the interdict from scotland and the excommunication of robert i the kings last journey appears to have been a pilgrimage to the shrine of saint ninian at whithorn this was possibly in search of a miraculous cure or to make his peace with god with moray by his side robert set off from his manor at cardross for tarbert on his great ship thence to the isle of arran where he celebrated christmas of  at the hall of glenkill near lamlash thence he sailed to the mainland to visit his son and his bride both mere children now installed at turnberry castle the head of the earldom of carrick and once his own main residence he journeyed overland being carried on a litter to inch in wigtownshire houses were built there and supplies brought to that place as though the kings condition had deteriorated at the end of march  he was staying at glenluce abbey and at monreith from where st ninians cave was visited early in april he arrived at the shrine of st ninian at whithorn he fasted four or five days and prayed to the saint before returning by sea to cardross barbour and other sources relate that robert summoned his prelates and barons to his bedside for a final council at which he made copious gifts to religious houses dispensed silver to religious foundations of various orders so that they might pray for his soul and repented of his failure to fulfil a vow to undertake a crusade to fight the saracens in the holy land roberts final wish reflected conventional piety and was perhaps intended to perpetuate his memory after his death his heart was to be removed from his body and accompanied by a company of knights led by sir james douglas taken on pilgrimage to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem before being interred in melrose abbey upon its return from the holy land i will that as soone as i am trespassed out of this worlde that ye take my harte owte of my body and embawme it

abbey death edit death and aftermathedit king robert i is buried in dunfermline abbey robert died on  june  at the manor of cardross near dumbarton apart from failing to fulfill a vow to undertake a crusade he died utterly fulfilled in that the goal of his lifetimes struggle—untrammelled recognition of the bruce right to the crown—had been realised and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant moray until his infant son reached adulthood six days after his death to complete his triumph still further papal bulls were issued granting the privilege of unction at the coronation of future kings of scots it remains unclear just what caused the death of robert i a month before his fiftyfifth birthday contemporary accusations that robert suffered from leprosy the unclean sickness—the presentday treatable hansens disease—derived from english and hainault chroniclers none of the scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy penman states that it is very difficult to accept the notion of robert as a functioning king serving in war performing facetoface acts of lordship holding parliament and court travelling widely and fathering several children all while displaying the infectious symptoms of a leper along with suggestions of eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or stroke a diet of rich court food has also been suggested as a possible contributory factor in roberts death his milanese physician maino de maineri did criticise the kings eating of eels as dangerous to his health in advancing years a team of researchers headed by professor andrew nelson from university of western ontario have determined that robert the bruce did not have leprosy during his lifetime they examined the original casting of the skull belonging to robert the bruces descendant lord andrew douglas alexander thomas bruce and a foot bone that had not been reinterned they determined that skull and foot bone showed no signs of leprosy such as an eroded nasal spine and a pencilling of the foot bone burialedit the kings body was embalmed at cardross and his sternum was sawn open to allow extraction of the

a number of knights dressed in black gowns accompanied the funeral party into dunfermline abbey a canopy chapel or hearse of imported baltic wood was erected over the grave robert is body in a wooden coffin was then interred within a stone vault beneath the floor underneath a box tomb of white italian marble purchased in paris by thomas of chartres after june  a plinth of black fossiliferous limestone from frosterley topped this structure and atop this plinth was a white alabaster effigy of robert i painted and gilded the following latin epitaph was inscribed around the top of the tomb hic jacet invictus robertus rex benedictus qui sua gesta legit repetit quot bella peregit ad libertatem perduxit per probitatem regnum scottorum nunc vivat in arce polorum here lies the invincible

fragments from the tomb are on display in the national museum of scotland and traces of gilding still remain on some of them robert had bequeathed sufficient funds to pay for thousands of obituary masses in dunfermline abbey and elsewhere and his tomb would thus be the site of daily votive prayers when a projected international crusade failed to materialise sir james douglas and his company

alfonso in august  the scots contingent formed part of the castilian army besieging the frontier castle of teba under circumstances which are still disputed sir james and most of his companions were

forming a headstone and a larger stone six feet  cm in length with six iron rings or handles set in it when these stones were removed the vault was found to be seven feet  cm in length  cm wide and  cm deep within the vault inside the remnants of a decayed oak coffin there was a body entirely enclosed in lead with a decayed shroud of cloth of gold over it over the head of the body the lead was formed into the shape of a crown fragments of marble and alabaster had been found in the debris around the site of the vault several years earlier which were linked to robert the bruces recorded purchase of a marble and alabaster tomb made in paris the barons of exchequer ordered that the vault was to be secured from all further inspection with new stones and iron bars and guarded by the town constables and that once the walls of the new church were built up around the site an investigation of the vault and the remains could take place accordingly on  november  the investigation took place the cloth of gold shroud and the lead covering were found to be in a rapid state of decay since the vault had first been opened  months earlier the body was raised up and placed on a wooden coffin board on the edge of the vault it was found to be covered in two thin layers of lead each around  mm thick the lead was removed and the skeleton was inspected by james gregory and alexander monro professor of anatomy at the university of edinburgh the sternum was found to have been sawn open from top to bottom permitting removal of the kings heart after death a plaster cast was taken of the detached skull by artist william scoular the bones were measured and drawn and the kings skeleton was measured to be  feet  inches  cm it has been estimated that bruce may have stood at around  feet  inch  cm tall as a young man which by medieval standards was impressive at this height he would have stood almost as tall as edward i  feet  inches  cm the skeleton lying on the wooden coffin board was then placed upon the top of a lead coffin and the large crowd of curious people who had assembled outside the church were allowed to file past the vault to view the kings remains it was at this point in the proceedings that some small relics—teeth and finger bones—were allegedly removed from the skeleton the published accounts of eyewitnesses such as henry jardine and james gregory confirm the removal of small objects at this time robert the bruces remains were ceremonially reinterred in the vault in dunfermline abbey on  november  they were placed in a new lead coffin into which was

third attempt inspired by this bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the english thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory the story serves to illustrate the maxim if at first

jewish sources about king david and in persian folklore about the mongolian warlord tamerlane and an ant it is said that before the battle of bannockburn bruce was attacked by the english knight sir henry de bohun riding with the heavy cavalry de bohun caught sight of bruce who was armed only with his battleaxe de bohun lowered his lance and charged and bruce stood his ground at the last moment bruce swiftly dodged the lance raised in his saddle and with one mighty swing of his axe struck bohun so hard that he split his iron helmet and his head in two so powerful that it shattered the very

during the first war of scottish independence against england he fought successfully during his reign to regain scotlands place as an independent country and is today revered in scotland as a national hero descended from the anglonorman and gaelic nobilities his paternal fourthgreat grandfather was king david i roberts grandfather robert de brus th lord of annandale was one of the claimants to the scottish throne during the great cause as earl of carrick robert the bruce supported his familys claim to the scottish throne and took part in william wallaces revolt against edward i of england appointed in  as a guardian of scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne john comyn lord of badenoch and william lamberton bishop of st andrews robert later resigned in  due to his quarrels with comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of king john balliol after submitting to edward i in  and returning to the kings peace robert inherited his familys claim to the scottish throne upon his fathers death in february  robert the bruce killed comyn following an argument and was excommunicated by the pope although he received absolution from robert wishart bishop of glasgow bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of scots on  march  edward is forces defeated robert in battle forcing him to flee into hiding in the hebrides and ireland before returning in  to defeat an english army at loudoun hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the english bruce defeated his other scots enemies destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands and in  held his first parliament a series of military victories between  and  won him control of much of scotland and at the battle of bannockburn in  robert defeated a much larger english army under edward ii of england confirming the reestablishment of an independent scottish kingdom the battle marked a significant turning point with roberts armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern england while also extending his war against the english to ireland by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the native irish to rise against edward iis rule despite bannockburn and the capture of the final english stronghold at berwick in  edward ii refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of scotland in  the scottish nobility submitted the declaration of arbroath to pope john xxii declaring robert as their rightful monarch and asserting scotlands status as an independent kingdom in  the pope recognised robert i as king of an independent scotland and in  the francoscottish alliance was renewed in the treaty of corbeil in  the english deposed edward ii in favour of his son edward iii and peace was concluded between scotland and england with the treaty of

line arrived in scotland with david i in  and was given the lands of annandale in dumfries and galloway robert i was one of the ten children and the eldest son of robert de brus th lord of annandale and marjorie countess of carrick and claimed the scottish throne as a fourth greatgrandson of david i his mother was by all accounts a formidable woman who legend would have it kept robert bruces father captive until he agreed to marry her from his mother he inherited the earldom of carrick and through his father a royal lineage that would give him a claim to the scottish throne the bruces also held substantial estates in aberdeenshire county antrim county durham essex middlesex and yorkshire early life –edit birthedit the remains of turnberry castle robert the bruces likely birthplace although robert the bruces date of birth is known his place of birth is less certain although it is most likely to have been turnberry castle in ayrshire the head of his mothers earldomnb  childhoodedit very little is known of his youth he was probably brought up in a mixture of the anglonorman culture of northern england and southeastern scotland and the gaelic culture of southwest scotland and most of scotland north of the river forth annandale was thoroughly feudalised and the form of northern middle english that would later develop into the scots language was spoken throughout the region carrick was historically an integral part of galloway and though the earls of carrick had achieved some feudalisation the society of carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically celtic and gaelic speaking robert the bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age he would have been schooled to speak read and possibly write in the anglonorman language of his scotsnorman peers and his fathers family he would also have spoken both the gaelic language of his carrick birthplace and his mothers family and the early scots language as the heir to a considerable estate and a pious layman robert would also have been given working knowledge of latin the language of charter lordship liturgy and prayer this would have afforded robert and his brothers access to basic education in the law politics scripture saints lives vitae philosophy history and chivalric instruction and romance that robert took personal pleasure in such learning and leisure is suggested in a number of ways barbour reported that robert read aloud to his band of supporters in  reciting from memory tales from a twelfthcentury romance of charlemagne fierabras as well as relating examples from history such as hannibals defiance of rome as king robert certainly commissioned verse to commemorate bannockburn and his subjects military deeds contemporary chroniclers jean le bel and thomas grey would both assert that they had read a history of his reign commissioned by king robert himself in his last years robert would pay for dominican friars to tutor his son david for whom he would also purchase books a parliamentary briefing document of c would also assert that robert used continually to read or have read in his presence the histories of ancient kings and princes and how they conducted themselves in their times both in wartime and in peacetime from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule tutors for the young robert and his brothers were most likely drawn from unbeneficed clergy or mendicant friars associated with the churches patronised by their family however as growing noble youths outdoor pursuits and great events would also have held a strong fascination for robert and his brothers they would have had masters drawn from their parents household to school them in the arts of horsemanship swordsmanship the joust hunting and perhaps aspects of courtly behaviour including dress protocol speech table etiquette music and dance some of which may have been learned before the age of ten while serving as pages in their fathers or grandfathers household as many of these personal and leadership skills were bound up within a code of chivalry roberts chief tutor was surely a reputable experienced knight drawn from his grandfathers crusade retinue this grandfather known to contemporaries as robert the noble and to history as bruce the competitor seems to have been an immense influence on the future king roberts later performance in war certainly underlines his skills in tactics and single combat the family would have moved between the castles of their lordships—lochmaben castle the main castle of the lordship of annandale and turnberry and loch doon castle the castles of the earldom of carrick a significant and profound part of the childhood experience of robert edward and possibly the other bruce brothers neil thomas and alexander was also gained through the gaelic tradition of being fostered to allied gaelic kindreds—a traditional practice in carrick southwest and western scotland the hebrides and ireland there were a number of carrick ayrshire hebridean and irish families and kindreds affiliated with the bruces who might have performed such a service roberts fosterbrother is referred to by barbour as sharing roberts precarious existence as an outlaw in carrick in – this gaelic influence has been cited as a possible explanation for robert the bruces apparent affinity for hobelar warfare using smaller sturdy ponies in mounted raids as well as for seapower ranging from oared wargalleys birlinns to boats according to historians such as barrow and penman it is also likely that when robert and edward bruce reached the male age of consent of twelve and began training for full knighthood they were sent to reside for a period with one or more allied english noble families such as the de clares of gloucester or perhaps even in the english royal household sir thomas grey asserted in his scalacronica that in about  robert the bruce then aged eighteen was a young bachelor of king edwards chamber while there remains little firm evidence of roberts presence at edwards court on  april  both robert and his father were pursued through the english chancery for their private household debts of £ by several merchants of winchester this raises the possibility that young robert the bruce was on occasion resident in a royal centre which edward i himself would visit frequently during his reign roberts first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by alexander og macdonald lord of islay his name appears in the company of the bishop of argyll the vicar of arran a kintyre clerk his father and a host of gaelic notaries from carrick robert bruce the king to be was sixteen years of age when margaret maid of norway died in  it is also around this time that robert would have been knighted and he began to appear on the political stage in the bruce dynastic interest the great causeedit roberts mother died early in  in november of the same year edward i of england on behalf of the guardians of scotland and following the great cause awarded the vacant crown of scotland to his grandfathers first cousin once removed john balliol almost immediately robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his lordship of annandale and transferred his claim to the scottish throne to his son antedating this statement to  november in turn that son robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his earldom of carrick to his eldest son robert the future king so as to protect the bruces kingship claim while their middle lord robert the bruces father now held only english lands while the bruces bid for the throne had ended in failure the balliols triumph propelled the eighteenyearold robert the bruce onto the political stage in his own right earl of carrick –edit the bruces regroupedit robert the bruce and isabella of mar as depicted in the  forman armorial even after johns accession edward still continued to assert his authority over scotland and relations between the two kings soon began to deteriorate the bruces sided with king edward against king john and his comyn allies robert the bruce and his father both considered john a usurper against the objections of the scots edward i agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of the guardians that had governed scotland during the interregnum a further provocation came in a case brought by macduff son of malcolm earl of fife in which edward demanded that john appear in person before the english parliament to answer the charges this the scottish king did but the final straw was edwards demand that the scottish magnates provide military service in englands war against france this was unacceptable the scots instead formed an alliance with france the comyndominated council acting in the name of king john summoned the scottish host to meet at caddonlee on  march the bruces and the earls of angus and march refused and the bruce family withdrew temporarily from scotland while the comyns seized their estates in annandale and carrick granting them to john comyn earl of buchan edward i thereupon provided a safe refuge for the bruces having appointed the lord of annandale to the command of carlisle castle in october  at some point in early  robert married his first wife isabella of mar the daughter of domhnall i earl of mar and his wife helen beginning of the wars of independenceedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message almost the first blow in the war between scotland and england was a direct attack on the bruces on  march  easter monday seven scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of carlisle which was not so much an attack against england as the comyn earl of buchan and their faction attacking their bruce enemies both his father and grandfather were at one time governors of the castle and following the loss of annandale to comyn in  it was their principal residence robert bruce would have gained firsthand knowledge of the citys defences the next time carlisle was besieged in  robert the bruce would be leading the attack edward i responded to king johns alliance with france and the attack on carlisle by invading scotland at the end of march  and taking the town of berwick in a particularly bloody attack upon the flimsy palisades at the battle of dunbar scottish resistance was effectively crushed edward deposed king john placed him in the tower of london and installed englishmen to govern the country the campaign had been very successful but the english triumph would only be temporary although the bruces were by now back in possession of annandale and carrick in august  robert bruce lord of annandale and his son robert bruce earl of carrick and future king were among the more than  scots at berwick who swore an oath of fealty to king edward i of england when the scottish revolt against edward i broke out in july  james stewart th high steward of scotland led into rebellion a group of disaffected scots including robert wishart bishop of glasgow macduff the son of the earl of fife and the young robert bruce the future king was now twentytwo and in joining the rebels he seems to have been acting independently of his father who took no part in the rebellion and appears to have abandoned annandale once more for the safety of carlisle it appears that robert bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfathers friends wishart and stewart who had inspired him to resistance with the outbreak of the revolt robert left carlisle and made his way to annandale where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and according to the english chronicler walter of guisborough addressed them thus no man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and i am no exception i must join my own people and the nation in which i was born i ask that you please come with me and you will be my councillors and close comrades urgent letters were sent ordering bruce to support edwards commander john de warenne th earl of surrey to whom bruce was related in the summer of  but instead of complying bruce continued to support the revolt against edward i that bruce was in the forefront of fomenting rebellion is shown in a letter written to edward by hugh cressingham on  july  which reports the opinion that if you had the earl of carrick the steward of scotland and his brotheryou would think your business done on  july bruce and his friends made terms with edward by a treaty called the capitulation of irvine the scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to king edward the bishop of glasgow james the steward and sir alexander lindsay became sureties for bruce until he delivered his infant daughter marjorie as a hostage which he never did when king edward returned to england after his victory at the battle of falkirk the bruces possessions were excepted from the lordships and lands that edward assigned to his followers the reason for this is uncertain though fordun records robert fighting for edward at falkirk under the command of antony bek bishop of durham annandale and carrick this participation is contested as no bruce appears on the falkirk roll of nobles present in the english army and two th century antiquarians alexander murison and george chalmers have stated bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste annandale and burn ayr castle to prevent it being garrisoned by the english guardianedit william wallace resigned as guardian of scotland after his defeat at the battle of falkirk he was succeeded by robert bruce and john comyn as joint guardians but they could not see past their personal differences as a nephew and supporter of king john and as someone with a serious claim to the scottish throne comyn was bruces enemy in  william lamberton bishop of st andrews was appointed as a third neutral guardian to try to maintain order between bruce and comyn the following year bruce finally resigned as joint guardian and was replaced by sir gilbert de umfraville earl of angus in may  umfraville comyn and lamberton also resigned as joint guardians and were replaced by sir john de soules as sole guardian soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the bruce nor the comyn camps and was a patriot he was an active guardian and made renewed efforts to have king john returned to the scottish throne in july  king edward i launched his sixth campaign into scotland though he captured the castles of bothwell and turnberry he did little to damage the scots fighting ability and in january  he agreed to a ninemonth truce it was around this time that robert the bruce submitted to edward along with other nobles even though he had been on the side of the scots until then there were rumours that john balliol would return to regain the scottish throne soules who had probably been appointed by john supported his return as did most other nobles but it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it in march  bruce sent a letter to the monks at melrose abbey apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national callup bruce pledged that henceforth he would never again require the monks to serve unless it was to the common army of the whole realm for national defence bruce also married his second wife that year elizabeth de burgh the daughter of richard de burgh nd earl of ulster by elizabeth he had four children david ii john died in childhood matilda who married thomas isaac and died at aberdeen  july  and margaret who married william de moravia th earl of sutherland in  in  edward invaded again reaching edinburgh before marching to perth edward stayed in perth until july then proceeded via dundee brechin and montrose to aberdeen where he arrived in august from there he marched through moray to badenoch before retracing his path back south to dunfermline with the country now under submission all the leading scots except for william wallace surrendered to edward in february  john comyn who was by now guardian submitted to edward the laws and liberties of scotland were to be as they had been in the days of alexander iii and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of king edward and the advice of the scots nobles on  june  bruce and william lamberton made a pact that bound them each to the other in friendship and alliance against all men if one should break the secret pact he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds the pact is often interpretedby whom as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the english homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the english parliament to establish rules for the governance of scotland the earl of richmond edwards nephew was to head up the subordinate government of scotland while all this took place william wallace was finally captured near glasgow and he was hanged drawn and quartered in london on  august  in september  edward ordered robert bruce to put his castle at kildrummy in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for suggesting that king edward suspected robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back however an identical phrase appears in an agreement between edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend aymer de valence a further sign of edwards distrust occurred on  october  when edward revoked his gift of sir gilbert de umfravilles lands to bruce that he had made only six months before robert bruce as earl of carrick and now th lord of annandale held huge estates and property in scotland and a barony and some minor properties in england and a strong claim to the scottish throne murder of john comynedit the killing of comyn in the greyfriars church in dumfries as imagined by felix philippoteaux a thcentury illustrator bruce like all his family had a complete belief in his right to the throne however his actions of supporting alternately the english and scottish armies had led to a great deal of distrust towards bruce among the community of the realm of scotland his ambition was further thwarted by john comyn who had been much more resolute in his opposition to the english comyn was the most powerful noble in scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within scotland and england including relatives that held the earldoms of buchan mar ross fife angus dunbar and strathearn the lordships of kilbride kirkintilloch lenzie bedrule and scraesburgh and sheriffdoms in banff dingwall wigtown and aberdeen he also had a powerful claim to the scottish throne through his descent from donald iii on his fathers side and david i on his mothers side comyn was the nephew of john balliol according to barbour and fordoun in the late summer of  in a secret agreement sworn signed and sealed john comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the scottish throne in favour of robert bruce upon receipt of the bruce lands in scotland should an uprising occur led by bruce whether the details of the agreement with comyn are correct or not king edward moved to arrest bruce while bruce was still at the english court fortunately for bruce his friend and edwards soninlaw ralph de monthermer learnt of edwards intention and warned bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs bruce took the hint and he and a squire fled the english court during the night they made their way quickly for scotland according to barbour comyn betrayed his agreement with bruce to king edward i and when bruce arranged a meeting for  february  with comyn in the chapel of greyfriars monastery in dumfries and accused him of treachery they came to blows bruce stabbed comyn before the high altar the scotichronicon says that on being told that comyn had survived the attack and was being treated two of bruces supporters roger de kirkpatrick uttering the words i mak siccar i make sure and john lindsay went back into the church and finished bruces work barbour however tells no such story bruce asserted his claim to the scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of scotland bruce and his party then attacked dumfries castle where the english garrison surrendered bruce hurried from dumfries to glasgow where his friend and supporter bishop robert wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to bruce nonetheless bruce was excommunicated for this crime english records still in existence today tell a completely different story they state that the comyn murder was planned in an attempt to gain the throne of scotland for this reason king edward of england wrote to the pope and asked for his excommunication of robert bruce no records have ever been found in england stating that king edward had any knowledge of treachery by robert bruce before his acts against comyn they state that king edward did not hear of the murder of john comyn until several days after his deathcitation needed early reign –edit war of robert iedit bruce crowned king of scots modern tableau at edinburgh castle six weeks after comyn was killed in dumfries bruce was crowned king of scots by bishop william de lamberton at scone near perth on  march  with all formality and solemnity the royal robes and vestments that robert wishart had hidden from the english were brought out by the bishop and set upon king robert the bishops of moray and glasgow were in attendance as well as the earls of atholl menteith lennox and mar the great banner of the kings of scotland was planted behind his throne isabella macduff countess of buchan and wife of john comyn rd earl of buchan a cousin of the murdered john comyn arrived the next day too late for the coronation she claimed the right of her family the macduff earl of fife to crown the scottish king for her brother donnchadh iv earl of fife who was not yet of age and in english hands so a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of robert bruce earl of carrick lord of annandale king of the scots in june  bruce was defeated at the battle of methven his wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to kildrummy in august  under the protection of bruces brother neil bruce and the earl of atholl and most of his remaining men bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men including sir james douglas and gilbert hay bruces brothers thomas alexander and edward as well as sir neil campbell and the earl of lennox edward i marched north again in the spring on his way he granted the scottish estates of bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating bruce bruces queen elizabeth his daughter marjorie his sisters christina and mary and isabella macduff were captured in a sanctuary at tain and sent to harsh imprisonment which included mary and isabella being hung in cages at roxburgh and berwick castles respectively for about four years while bruces brother neil was executed by being hanged drawn and quartered on  july king edward i died leaving bruce opposed by the kings son edward ii bruce in jungle it is still uncertain where bruce spent the winter of – most likely he spent it in the hebrides possibly sheltered by christina of garmoran who was married to bruces brotherinlaw duncan the brother of bruces first wife isabella of mar ireland is also a serious possibility and orkney under norwegian rule at the time or norway proper where his sister isabel bruce was queen dowager although unlikely are not impossible bruce and his followers returned to the scottish mainland in february in two groups one led by bruce and his brother edward landed at turnberry castle and began a guerrilla war in southwest scotland the other led by his brothers thomas and alexander landed slightly further south in loch ryan but they were soon captured and executed in april bruce won a small victory over the english at the battle of glen trool before defeating aymer de valence nd earl of pembroke at the battle of loudoun hill at the same time james douglas made his first foray for bruce into southwestern scotland attacking and burning his own castle in douglasdale leaving his brother edward in command in galloway bruce travelled north capturing inverlochy and urquhart castles burning inverness castle and nairn to the ground then unsuccessfully threatening elgin transferring operations to aberdeenshire in late  he threatened banff before falling seriously ill probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign recovering leaving john comyn rd earl of buchan unsubdued at his rear bruce returned west to take balvenie and duffus castles then tarradale castle on the black isle looping back via the hinterlands of inverness and a second failed attempt to take elgin bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of comyn at the battle of inverurie in may  he then overran buchan and defeated the english garrison at aberdeen the harrying of buchan in  was ordered by bruce to make sure all comyn family support was extinguished buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern scotland and much of its population was loyal to the comyn family even after the defeat of the earl of buchan most of the comyn castles in moray aberdeen and buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed bruce ordered similar harryings in argyle and kintyre in the territories of clan macdougall with these acts bruce had successfully destroyed the power of the comyns which had controlled much of northern and southwestern scotland for over a hundred and fifty years he then crossed to argyll and defeated the macdougalls allies of the comyns at the battle of pass of brander and took dunstaffnage castle the last major stronghold of the comyns in march  bruce held his first parliament at st andrews and by august he controlled all of scotland north of the river tay the following year the clergy of scotland recognised bruce as king at a general council the support given to him by the church in spite of his excommunication was of great political importance on the  october  bruce wrote to edward ii of england from kildrum in cumbernauld parish trying unsuccessfully to establish peace between scotland and england over the next three years one englishheld castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced linlithgow in  dumbarton in  and perth by bruce himself in january  bruce also made raids into northern england and landing at ramsey in the isle of man then laid siege to castle rushen in castletown capturing it on  june  and denying the islands strategic importance to the english the eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the english on even ground have caused many to consider bruce as one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age this represented a transformation for one raised as a feudal knight battle of bannockburnedit depiction of the battle of bannockburn in  from the holkham bible main article battle of bannockburn by  robert i had recaptured most of the castles in scotland once held by the english and was sending raiding parties into northern england as far as carlisle in response edward ii planned a major military campaign with the support of lancaster and the barons mustering a large army between  and  strong in the spring of  edward bruce laid siege to stirling castle a key fortification in scotland whose governor philip de mowbray agreed to capitulate if not relieved before  june  in march james douglas captured roxburgh and randolph captured edinburgh castle while in may bruce again raided england and subdued the isle of man news of the agreement regarding stirling castle reached the english king in late may and he decided to speed up his march north from berwick to relieve the castle robert with between  and  troops predominantly spearmen prepared to prevent edwards forces from reaching stirling the battle began on  june as the english army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the bannock burn which was surrounded by marshland skirmishing between the two sides broke out resulting in the death of sir henry de bohun whom robert killed in personal combat edward continued his advance the following day and encountered the bulk of the scottish army as they emerged from the woods of new park the english appear not to have expected the scots to give battle here and as a result had kept their forces in marching rather than battle order with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − at the back of the army rather than the front the english cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by roberts spearmen the english army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control edward ii was dragged away from the battlefield hotly pursued by the scottish forces and only just escaped the heavy fighting the historian roy haines describes the defeat as a calamity of stunning proportions for the english whose losses in the battle were huge in the aftermath of the defeat edward retreated to dunbar then travelled by ship to berwick and then back to york in his absence stirling castle quickly fell midreign –edit bruce reviewing troops before the battle of bannockburn further confrontation with england then the irish conflictedit main article bruce campaign in ireland freed from english threats scotlands armies could now invade northern england bruce also drove back a subsequent english expedition north of the border and launched raids into yorkshire and lancashire buoyed by his military successes bruces forces also invaded ireland in  purportedly to free the country from english rule having received a reply to offers of assistance from donal oneil king of tyrone and to open a second front in the continuing wars with england the irish even crowned edward bruce as high king of ireland in  robert later went there with another army to assist his brother in conjunction with the invasion bruce popularised an ideological vision of a pangaelic greater scotia with his lineage ruling over both ireland and scotland this propaganda campaign was aided by two factors the first was his marriage alliance from  with the de burgh family of the earldom of ulster in ireland second bruce himself on his mothers side of carrick was descended from gaelic royalty in scotland as well as ireland bruces irish ancestors included eva of leinster d whose ancestors included brian boru of munster and the kings of leinster thus lineally and geopolitically bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pangaelic alliance between scottishirish gaelic populations under his kingship this is revealed by a letter he sent to the irish chiefs where he calls the scots and irish collectively nostra nacio our nation stressing the common language customs and heritage of the two peoples whereas we and you and our people and your people free since ancient times share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom we have sent you our beloved kinsman the bearers of this letter to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you so that with gods will our nation nostra nacio may be able to recover her ancient liberty the diplomacy worked to a certain extent at least in ulster where the scots had some support the irish chief donal oneil for instance later justified his support for the scots to pope john xxii by saying the kings of lesser scotia all trace their blood to our greater scotia and retain to some degree our language and customs the bruce campaign in ireland was characterised by some initial military success however the scots failed to win over the nonulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island where people couldnt see the difference between english and scottish occupation eventually it was defeated when edward bruce was killed at the battle of faughart the irish annals of the period described the defeat of the bruces by the english as one of the greatest things ever done for the irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the irish by both the scots and the english later reign –edit the tyninghame copy of the declaration of arbroath the reign of robert bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements the declaration of arbroath of  strengthened his position particularly visàvis the papacy and pope john xxii eventually lifted bruces excommunication in may  king edward iii of england signed the treaty of edinburghnorthampton which recognised scotland as an independent kingdom and bruce as its king in  robert i exchanged lands at cardross for those of old montrose in angus with sir david graham it was to be here that robert would build the manor house that would serve as his favoured residence during the final years of his reign the extant chamberlains accounts for  detail a manor house at cardross with kings and queens chambers and glazed windows a chapel kitchens bake and brewhouses falcon aviary medicinal garden gatehouse protective moat and a hunting park there was also a jetty and beaching area for the kings coble for fishing alongside the kings great shipnb  as most of mainland scotlands major royal castles had remained in their razed state since around – cardross manor was perhaps built as a modest residence sympathetic to roberts subjects privations through a long war repeated famines and livestock pandemics before cardross became habitable in  robert is main residence had been scone abbey robert i had been suffering from a serious illness from at least  the lanercost chronicle and scalacronica state that the king was said to have contracted and died of leprosy jean le bel also stated that in  the king was a victim of la grosse maladie which is usually taken to mean leprosy however the ignorant use of the term leprosy by fourteenthcentury writers meant that almost any major skin disease might be called leprosy the earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eyewitness in ulster at the time the king made a truce with sir henry mandeville on  july  the writer of this letter reported that robert i was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue barbour writes of the kings illness that it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying during the months of wandering from  to  it has been proposed that alternatively he may have suffered from eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or a series of strokes there does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be nor is there any evidence of an attempt in his last years to segregate the king in any way from the company of friends family courtiers or foreign diplomats in october  the pope finally lifted the interdict from scotland and the excommunication of robert i the kings last journey appears to have been a pilgrimage to the shrine of saint ninian at whithorn this was possibly in search of a miraculous cure or to make his peace with god with moray by his side robert set off from his manor at cardross for tarbert on his great ship thence to the isle of arran where he celebrated christmas of  at the hall of glenkill near lamlash thence he sailed to the mainland to visit his son and his bride both mere children now installed at turnberry castle the head of the earldom of carrick and once his own main residence he journeyed overland being carried on a litter to inch in wigtownshire houses were built there and supplies brought to that place as though the kings condition had deteriorated at the end of march  he was staying at glenluce abbey and at monreith from where st ninians cave was visited early in april he arrived at the shrine of st ninian at whithorn he fasted four or five days and prayed to the saint before returning by sea to cardross barbour and other sources relate that robert summoned his prelates and barons to his bedside for a final council at which he made copious gifts to religious houses dispensed silver to religious foundations of various orders so that they might pray for his soul and repented of his failure to fulfil a vow to undertake a crusade to fight the saracens in the holy land roberts final wish reflected conventional piety and was perhaps intended to perpetuate his memory after his death his heart was to be removed from his body and accompanied by a company of knights led by sir james douglas taken on pilgrimage to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem before being interred in melrose abbey upon its return from the holy land i will that as soone as i am trespassed out of this worlde that ye take my harte owte of my body and embawme it and take of my treasoure as ye shall thynke sufficient for that enterprise both for your selfe and suche company as ye wyll take with you and present my hart to the holy sepulchre where as our lorde laye seyng my body can nat come there robert also arranged for perpetual soul masses to be funded at the chapel of saint serf at ayr and at the dominican friary in berwick as well as at dunfermline abbey death edit death and aftermathedit king robert i is buried in dunfermline abbey robert died on  june  at the manor of cardross near dumbarton apart from failing to fulfill a vow to undertake a crusade he died utterly fulfilled in that the goal of his lifetimes struggle—untrammelled recognition of the bruce right to the crown—had been realised and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant moray until his infant son reached adulthood six days after his death to complete his triumph still further papal bulls were issued granting the privilege of unction at the coronation of future kings of scots it remains unclear just what caused the death of robert i a month before his fiftyfifth birthday contemporary accusations that robert suffered from leprosy the unclean sickness—the presentday treatable hansens disease—derived from english and hainault chroniclers none of the scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy penman states that it is very difficult to accept the notion of robert as a functioning king serving in war performing facetoface acts of lordship holding parliament and court travelling widely and fathering several children all while displaying the infectious symptoms of a leper along with suggestions of eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or stroke a diet of rich court food has also been suggested as a possible contributory factor in roberts death his milanese physician maino de maineri did criticise the kings eating of eels as dangerous to his health in advancing years a team of researchers headed by professor andrew nelson from university of western ontario have determined that robert the bruce did not have leprosy during his lifetime they examined the original casting of the skull belonging to robert the bruces descendant lord andrew douglas alexander thomas bruce and a foot bone that had not been reinterned they determined that skull and foot bone showed no signs of leprosy such as an eroded nasal spine and a pencilling of the foot bone burialedit the kings body was embalmed at cardross and his sternum was sawn open to allow extraction of the heart which sir james douglas placed in a silver casket to be worn on a chain around his neck with sir simon locard holding the key roberts viscera were interred in the chapel of saint serf near cardross the ruins of which are located in the presentday levengrove park in dumbarton the kings body was carried east from cardross by a carriage decked in black lawn cloth with stops recorded at dunipace and cambuskenneth abbey the funeral was a grand affair with  stone  kg of wax having been purchased for the making of funerary candles a file of mourners on foot including robert stewart and a number of knights dressed in black gowns accompanied the funeral party into dunfermline abbey a canopy chapel or hearse of imported baltic wood was erected over the grave robert is body in a wooden coffin was then interred within a stone vault beneath the floor underneath a box tomb of white italian marble purchased in paris by thomas of chartres after june  a plinth of black fossiliferous limestone from frosterley topped this structure and atop this plinth was a white alabaster effigy of robert i painted and gilded the following latin epitaph was inscribed around the top of the tomb hic jacet invictus robertus rex benedictus qui sua gesta legit repetit quot bella peregit ad libertatem perduxit per probitatem regnum scottorum nunc vivat in arce polorum here lies the invincible blessed king robert  whoever reads about his feats will repeat the many battles he fought  by his integrity he guided to liberty the kingdom of the scots may he now live in heaven ten alabaster fragments from the tomb are on display in the national museum of scotland and traces of gilding still remain on some of them robert had bequeathed sufficient funds to pay for thousands of obituary masses in dunfermline abbey and elsewhere and his tomb would thus be the site of daily votive prayers when a projected international crusade failed to materialise sir james douglas and his company escorting the casket containing bruces heart sailed to spain where alfonso xi of castile was mounting a campaign against the moorish kingdom of granada according to john barbour douglas and his companions including sir william de keith sir simon locard sir william de st clair of rosslyn and the brothers sir robert logan of restalrig and sir walter logan were welcomed cordially by king alfonso in august  the scots contingent formed part of the castilian army besieging the frontier castle of teba under circumstances which are still disputed sir james and most of his companions were killed the sources all agree that outnumbered and separated from the main christian army a group of scots knights led by douglas was overwhelmed and wiped out the surviving members including sir simon locard of the company recovered douglas body together with the casket containing bruces heart the heart together with douglas bones were brought back to scotland in accordance with bruces written request the heart was buried at melrose abbey in roxburghshire in  the heart was discovered by archaeologists and was reburied but the location was not marked in  a casket was unearthed during construction work scientific study by aoc archaeologists in edinburgh demonstrated that it did indeed contain human tissue and it was of appropriate age it was reburied in melrose abbey in  pursuant to the dying wishes of the king discovery of the bruces tombedit main article dunfermline abbey plaster cast of robert is skull by william scoular on  february  workmen breaking ground on the new parish church to be built on the site of the eastern choir of dunfermline abbey uncovered a vault before the site of the former abbey high altar the vault was covered by two large flat stones—one forming a headstone and a larger stone six feet  cm in length with six iron rings or handles set in it when these stones were removed the vault was found to be seven feet  cm in length  cm wide and  cm deep within the vault inside the remnants of a decayed oak coffin there was a body entirely enclosed in lead with a decayed shroud of cloth of gold over it over the head of the body the lead was formed into the shape of a crown fragments of marble and alabaster had been found in the debris around the site of the vault several years earlier which were linked to robert the bruces recorded purchase of a marble and alabaster tomb made in paris the barons of exchequer ordered that the vault was to be secured from all further inspection with new stones and iron bars and guarded by the town constables and that once the walls of the new church were built up around the site an investigation of the vault and the remains could take place accordingly on  november  the investigation took place the cloth of gold shroud and the lead covering were found to be in a rapid state of decay since the vault had first been opened  months earlier the body was raised up and placed on a wooden coffin board on the edge of the vault it was found to be covered in two thin layers of lead each around  mm thick the lead was removed and the skeleton was inspected by james gregory and alexander monro professor of anatomy at the university of edinburgh the sternum was found to have been sawn open from top to bottom permitting removal of the kings heart after death a plaster cast was taken of the detached skull by artist william scoular the bones were measured and drawn and the kings skeleton was measured to be  feet  inches  cm it has been estimated that bruce may have stood at around  feet  inch  cm tall as a young man which by medieval standards was impressive at this height he would have stood almost as tall as edward i  feet  inches  cm the skeleton lying on the wooden coffin board was then placed upon the top of a lead coffin and the large crowd of curious people who had assembled outside the church were allowed to file past the vault to view the kings remains it was at this point in the proceedings that some small relics—teeth and finger bones—were allegedly removed from the skeleton the published accounts of eyewitnesses such as henry jardine and james gregory confirm the removal of small objects at this time robert the bruces remains were ceremonially reinterred in the vault in dunfermline abbey on  november  they were placed in a new lead coffin into which was poured  lbs of molten pitch to preserve the remains before the coffin was sealed a number of reconstructions of the face of robert the bruce have been produced including those by richard neave from

jewish sources about king david and in persian folklore about the mongolian warlord tamerlane and an ant it is said that before the battle of bannockburn bruce was attacked by the english knight sir henry de bohun riding with the heavy cavalry de bohun caught sight of bruce who was armed only with his battleaxe de bohun lowered his lance and charged and bruce stood his ground at the last moment bruce swiftly dodged the lance raised in his saddle and with one mighty swing of his axe struck bohun so hard that he split his iron helmet and his head in two so powerful that it shattered the very weapon into pieces afterwards the king merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe to this day the story stands in folklore as a testament of the scottish people and

during the first war of scottish independence against england he fought successfully during his reign to regain scotlands place as an independent country and is today revered in scotland as a national hero descended from the anglonorman and gaelic nobilities his paternal fourthgreat grandfather was king david i roberts grandfather robert de brus th lord of annandale was one of the claimants to the scottish throne during the great cause as earl of carrick robert the bruce supported his familys claim to the scottish throne and took part in william wallaces revolt against edward i of england appointed in  as a guardian of scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne john comyn lord of badenoch and william lamberton bishop of st andrews robert later resigned in  due to his quarrels with comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of king john balliol after submitting to edward i in  and returning to the kings peace robert inherited his familys claim to the scottish throne upon his fathers death in february  robert the bruce killed comyn following an argument and was excommunicated by the pope although he received absolution from robert wishart bishop of glasgow bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of scots on  march  edward is forces defeated robert in battle forcing him to flee into hiding in the hebrides and ireland before returning in  to defeat an english army at loudoun hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the english bruce defeated his other scots enemies destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands and in  held his first parliament a series of military victories between  and  won him control of much of scotland and at the battle of bannockburn in  robert defeated a much larger english army under edward ii of england confirming the reestablishment of an independent scottish kingdom the battle marked a significant turning point with roberts armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern england while also extending his war against the english to ireland by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the native irish to rise against edward iis rule despite bannockburn and the capture of the final english stronghold at berwick in  edward ii refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of scotland in  the scottish nobility submitted the declaration of arbroath to pope john xxii declaring robert as their rightful monarch and asserting scotlands status as an independent kingdom in  the pope recognised robert i as king of an independent scotland and in  the francoscottish alliance was renewed in the treaty of corbeil in  the english deposed edward ii in favour of his son edward iii and peace was concluded between scotland and england with the treaty of

line arrived in scotland with david i in  and was given the lands of annandale in dumfries and galloway robert i was one of the ten children and the eldest son of robert de brus th lord of annandale and marjorie countess of carrick and claimed the scottish throne as a fourth greatgrandson of david i his mother was by all accounts a formidable woman who legend would have it kept robert bruces father captive until he agreed to marry her from his mother he inherited the earldom of carrick and through his father a royal lineage that would give him a claim to the scottish throne the bruces also held substantial estates in aberdeenshire county antrim county durham essex middlesex and yorkshire early life –edit birthedit the remains of turnberry castle robert the bruces likely birthplace although robert the bruces date of birth is known his place of birth is less certain although it is most likely to have been turnberry castle in ayrshire the head of his mothers earldomnb  childhoodedit very little is known of his youth he was probably brought up in a mixture of the anglonorman culture of northern england and southeastern scotland and the gaelic culture of southwest scotland and most of scotland north of the river forth annandale was thoroughly feudalised and the form of northern middle english that would later develop into the scots language was spoken throughout the region carrick was historically an integral part of galloway and though the earls of carrick had achieved some feudalisation the society of carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically celtic and gaelic speaking robert the bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age he would have been schooled to speak read and possibly write in the anglonorman language of his scotsnorman peers and his fathers family he would also have spoken both the gaelic language of his carrick birthplace and his mothers family and the early scots language as the heir to a considerable estate and a pious layman robert would also have been given working knowledge of latin the language of charter lordship liturgy and prayer this would have afforded robert and his brothers access to basic education in the law politics scripture saints lives vitae philosophy history and chivalric instruction and romance that robert took personal pleasure in such learning and leisure is suggested in a number of ways barbour reported that robert read aloud to his band of supporters in  reciting from memory tales from a twelfthcentury romance of charlemagne fierabras as well as relating examples from history such as hannibals defiance of rome as king robert certainly commissioned verse to commemorate bannockburn and his subjects military deeds contemporary chroniclers jean le bel and thomas grey would both assert that they had read a history of his reign commissioned by king robert himself in his last years robert would pay for dominican friars to tutor his son david for whom he would also purchase books a parliamentary briefing document of c would also assert that robert used continually to read or have read in his presence the histories of ancient kings and princes and how they conducted themselves in their times both in wartime and in peacetime from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule tutors for the young robert and his brothers were most likely drawn from unbeneficed clergy or mendicant friars associated with the churches patronised by their family however as growing noble youths outdoor pursuits and great events would also have held a strong fascination for robert and his brothers they would have had masters drawn from their parents household to school them in the arts of horsemanship swordsmanship the joust hunting and perhaps aspects of courtly behaviour including dress protocol speech table etiquette music and dance some of which may have been learned before the age of ten while serving as pages in their fathers or grandfathers household as many of these personal and leadership skills were bound up within a code of chivalry roberts chief tutor was surely a reputable experienced knight drawn from his grandfathers crusade retinue this grandfather known to contemporaries as robert the noble and to history as bruce the competitor seems to have been an immense influence on the future king roberts later performance in war certainly underlines his skills in tactics and single combat the family would have moved between the castles of their lordships—lochmaben castle the main castle of the lordship of annandale and turnberry and loch doon castle the castles of the earldom of carrick a significant and profound part of the childhood experience of robert edward and possibly the other bruce brothers neil thomas and alexander was also gained through the gaelic tradition of being fostered to allied gaelic kindreds—a traditional practice in carrick southwest and western scotland the hebrides and ireland there were a number of carrick ayrshire hebridean and irish families and kindreds affiliated with the bruces who might have performed such a service roberts fosterbrother is referred to by barbour as sharing roberts precarious existence as an outlaw in carrick in – this gaelic influence has been cited as a possible explanation for robert the bruces apparent affinity for hobelar warfare using smaller sturdy ponies in mounted raids as well as for seapower ranging from oared wargalleys birlinns to boats according to historians such as barrow and penman it is also likely that when robert and edward bruce reached the male age of consent of twelve and began training for full knighthood they were sent to reside for a period with one or more allied english noble families such as the de clares of gloucester or perhaps even in the english royal household sir thomas grey asserted in his scalacronica that in about  robert the bruce then aged eighteen was a young bachelor of king edwards chamber while there remains little firm evidence of roberts presence at edwards court on  april  both robert and his father were pursued through the english chancery for their private household debts of £ by several merchants of winchester this raises the possibility that young robert the bruce was on occasion resident in a royal centre which edward i himself would visit frequently during his reign roberts first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by alexander og macdonald lord of islay his name appears in the company of the bishop of argyll the vicar of arran a kintyre clerk his father and a host of gaelic notaries from carrick robert bruce the king to be was sixteen years of age when margaret maid of norway died in  it is also around this time that robert would have been knighted and he began to appear on the political stage in the bruce dynastic interest the great causeedit roberts mother died early in  in november of the same year edward i of england on behalf of the guardians of scotland and following the great cause awarded the vacant crown of scotland to his grandfathers first cousin once removed john balliol almost immediately robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his lordship of annandale and transferred his claim to the scottish throne to his son antedating this statement to  november in turn that son robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his earldom of carrick to his eldest son robert the future king so as to protect the bruces kingship claim while their middle lord robert the bruces father now held only english lands while the bruces bid for the throne had ended in failure the balliols triumph propelled the eighteenyearold robert the bruce onto the political stage in his own right earl of carrick –edit the bruces regroupedit robert the bruce and isabella of mar as depicted in the  forman armorial even after johns accession edward still continued to assert his authority over scotland and relations between the two kings soon began to deteriorate the bruces sided with king edward against king john and his comyn allies robert the bruce and his father both considered john a usurper against the objections of the scots edward i agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of the guardians that had governed scotland during the interregnum a further provocation came in a case brought by macduff son of malcolm earl of fife in which edward demanded that john appear in person before the english parliament to answer the charges this the scottish king did but the final straw was edwards demand that the scottish magnates provide military service in englands war against france this was unacceptable the scots instead formed an alliance with france the comyndominated council acting in the name of king john summoned the scottish host to meet at caddonlee on  march the bruces and the earls of angus and march refused and the bruce family withdrew temporarily from scotland while the comyns seized their estates in annandale and carrick granting them to john comyn earl of buchan edward i thereupon provided a safe refuge for the bruces having appointed the lord of annandale to the command of carlisle castle in october  at some point in early  robert married his first wife isabella of mar the daughter of domhnall i earl of mar and his wife helen beginning of the wars of independenceedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message almost the first blow in the war between scotland and england was a direct attack on the bruces on  march  easter monday seven scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of carlisle which was not so much an attack against england as the comyn earl of buchan and their faction attacking their bruce enemies both his father and grandfather were at one time governors of the castle and following the loss of annandale to comyn in  it was their principal residence robert bruce would have gained firsthand knowledge of the citys defences the next time carlisle was besieged in  robert the bruce would be leading the attack edward i responded to king johns alliance with france and the attack on carlisle by invading scotland at the end of march  and taking the town of berwick in a particularly bloody attack upon the flimsy palisades at the battle of dunbar scottish resistance was effectively crushed edward deposed king john placed him in the tower of london and installed englishmen to govern the country the campaign had been very successful but the english triumph would only be temporary although the bruces were by now back in possession of annandale and carrick in august  robert bruce lord of annandale and his son robert bruce earl of carrick and future king were among the more than  scots at berwick who swore an oath of fealty to king edward i of england when the scottish revolt against edward i broke out in july  james stewart th high steward of scotland led into rebellion a group of disaffected scots including robert wishart bishop of glasgow macduff the son of the earl of fife and the young robert bruce the future king was now twentytwo and in joining the rebels he seems to have been acting independently of his father who took no part in the rebellion and appears to have abandoned annandale once more for the safety of carlisle it appears that robert bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfathers friends wishart and stewart who had inspired him to resistance with the outbreak of the revolt robert left carlisle and made his way to annandale where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and according to the english chronicler walter of guisborough addressed them thus no man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and i am no exception i must join my own people and the nation in which i was born i ask that you please come with me and you will be my councillors and close comrades urgent letters were sent ordering bruce to support edwards commander john de warenne th earl of surrey to whom bruce was related in the summer of  but instead of complying bruce continued to support the revolt against edward i that bruce was in the forefront of fomenting rebellion is shown in a letter written to edward by hugh cressingham on  july  which reports the opinion that if you had the earl of carrick the steward of scotland and his brotheryou would think your business done on  july bruce and his friends made terms with edward by a treaty called the capitulation of irvine the scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to king edward the bishop of glasgow james the steward and sir alexander lindsay became sureties for bruce until he delivered his infant daughter marjorie as a hostage which he never did when king edward returned to england after his victory at the battle of falkirk the bruces possessions were excepted from the lordships and lands that edward assigned to his followers the reason for this is uncertain though fordun records robert fighting for edward at falkirk under the command of antony bek bishop of durham annandale and carrick this participation is contested as no bruce appears on the falkirk roll of nobles present in the english army and two th century antiquarians alexander murison and george chalmers have stated bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste annandale and burn ayr castle to prevent it being garrisoned by the english guardianedit william wallace resigned as guardian of scotland after his defeat at the battle of falkirk he was succeeded by robert bruce and john comyn as joint guardians but they could not see past their personal differences as a nephew and supporter of king john and as someone with a serious claim to the scottish throne comyn was bruces enemy in  william lamberton bishop of st andrews was appointed as a third neutral guardian to try to maintain order between bruce and comyn the following year bruce finally resigned as joint guardian and was replaced by sir gilbert de umfraville earl of angus in may  umfraville comyn and lamberton also resigned as joint guardians and were replaced by sir john de soules as sole guardian soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the bruce nor the comyn camps and was a patriot he was an active guardian and made renewed efforts to have king john returned to the scottish throne in july  king edward i launched his sixth campaign into scotland though he captured the castles of bothwell and turnberry he did little to damage the scots fighting ability and in january  he agreed to a ninemonth truce it was around this time that robert the bruce submitted to edward along with other nobles even though he had been on the side of the scots until then there were rumours that john balliol would return to regain the scottish throne soules who had probably been appointed by john supported his return as did most other nobles but it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it in march  bruce sent a letter to the monks at melrose abbey apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national callup bruce pledged that henceforth he would never again require the monks to serve unless it was to the common army of the whole realm for national defence bruce also married his second wife that year elizabeth de burgh the daughter of richard de burgh nd earl of ulster by elizabeth he had four children david ii john died in childhood matilda who married thomas isaac and died at aberdeen  july  and margaret who married william de moravia th earl of sutherland in  in  edward invaded again reaching edinburgh before marching to perth edward stayed in perth until july then proceeded via dundee brechin and montrose to aberdeen where he arrived in august from there he marched through moray to badenoch before retracing his path back south to dunfermline with the country now under submission all the leading scots except for william wallace surrendered to edward in february  john comyn who was by now guardian submitted to edward the laws and liberties of scotland were to be as they had been in the days of alexander iii and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of king edward and the advice of the scots nobles on  june  bruce and william lamberton made a pact that bound them each to the other in friendship and alliance against all men if one should break the secret pact he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds the pact is often interpretedby whom as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the english homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the english parliament to establish rules for the governance of scotland the earl of richmond edwards nephew was to head up the subordinate government of scotland while all this took place william wallace was finally captured near glasgow and he was hanged drawn and quartered in london on  august  in september  edward ordered robert bruce to put his castle at kildrummy in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for suggesting that king edward suspected robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back however an identical phrase appears in an agreement between edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend aymer de valence a further sign of edwards distrust occurred on  october  when edward revoked his gift of sir gilbert de umfravilles lands to bruce that he had made only six months before robert bruce as earl of carrick and now th lord of annandale held huge estates and property in scotland and a barony and some minor properties in england and a strong claim to the scottish throne murder of john comynedit the killing of comyn in the greyfriars church in dumfries as imagined by felix philippoteaux a thcentury illustrator bruce like all his family had a complete belief in his right to the throne however his actions of supporting alternately the english and scottish armies had led to a great deal of distrust towards bruce among the community of the realm of scotland his ambition was further thwarted by john comyn who had been much more resolute in his opposition to the english comyn was the most powerful noble in scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within scotland and england including relatives that held the earldoms of buchan mar ross fife angus dunbar and strathearn the lordships of kilbride kirkintilloch lenzie bedrule and scraesburgh and sheriffdoms in banff dingwall wigtown and aberdeen he also had a powerful claim to the scottish throne through his descent from donald iii on his fathers side and david i on his mothers side comyn was the nephew of john balliol according to barbour and fordoun in the late summer of  in a secret agreement sworn signed and sealed john comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the scottish throne in favour of robert bruce upon receipt of the bruce lands in scotland should an uprising occur led by bruce whether the details of the agreement with comyn are correct or not king edward moved to arrest bruce while bruce was still at the english court fortunately for bruce his friend and edwards soninlaw ralph de monthermer learnt of edwards intention and warned bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs bruce took the hint and he and a squire fled the english court during the night they made their way quickly for scotland according to barbour comyn betrayed his agreement with bruce to king edward i and when bruce arranged a meeting for  february  with comyn in the chapel of greyfriars monastery in dumfries and accused him of treachery they came to blows bruce stabbed comyn before the high altar the scotichronicon says that on being told that comyn had survived the attack and was being treated two of bruces supporters roger de kirkpatrick uttering the words i mak siccar i make sure and john lindsay went back into the church and finished bruces work barbour however tells no such story bruce asserted his claim to the scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of scotland bruce and his party then attacked dumfries castle where the english garrison surrendered bruce hurried from dumfries to glasgow where his friend and supporter bishop robert wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to bruce nonetheless bruce was excommunicated for this crime english records still in existence today tell a completely different story they state that the comyn murder was planned in an attempt to gain the throne of scotland for this reason king edward of england wrote to the pope and asked for his excommunication of robert bruce no records have ever been found in england stating that king edward had any knowledge of treachery by robert bruce before his acts against comyn they state that king edward did not hear of the murder of john comyn until several days after his deathcitation needed early reign –edit war of robert iedit bruce crowned king of scots modern tableau at edinburgh castle six weeks after comyn was killed in dumfries bruce was crowned king of scots by bishop william de lamberton at scone near perth on  march  with all formality and solemnity the royal robes and vestments that robert wishart had hidden from the english were brought out by the bishop and set upon king robert the bishops of moray and glasgow were in attendance as well as the earls of atholl menteith lennox and mar the great banner of the kings of scotland was planted behind his throne isabella macduff countess of buchan and wife of john comyn rd earl of buchan a cousin of the murdered john comyn arrived the next day too late for the coronation she claimed the right of her family the macduff earl of fife to crown the scottish king for her brother donnchadh iv earl of fife who was not yet of age and in english hands so a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of robert bruce earl of carrick lord of annandale king of the scots in june  bruce was defeated at the battle of methven his wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to kildrummy in august  under the protection of bruces brother neil bruce and the earl of atholl and most of his remaining men bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men including sir james douglas and gilbert hay bruces brothers thomas alexander and edward as well as sir neil campbell and the earl of lennox edward i marched north again in the spring on his way he granted the scottish estates of bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating bruce bruces queen elizabeth his daughter marjorie his sisters christina and mary and isabella macduff were captured in a sanctuary at tain and sent to harsh imprisonment which included mary and isabella being hung in cages at roxburgh and berwick castles respectively for about four years while bruces brother neil was executed by being hanged drawn and quartered on  july king edward i died leaving bruce opposed by the kings son edward ii bruce in jungle it is still uncertain where bruce spent the winter of – most likely he spent it in the hebrides possibly sheltered by christina of garmoran who was married to bruces brotherinlaw duncan the brother of bruces first wife isabella of mar ireland is also a serious possibility and orkney under norwegian rule at the time or norway proper where his sister isabel bruce was queen dowager although unlikely are not impossible bruce and his followers returned to the scottish mainland in february in two groups one led by bruce and his brother edward landed at turnberry castle and began a guerrilla war in southwest scotland the other led by his brothers thomas and alexander landed slightly further south in loch ryan but they were soon captured and executed in april bruce won a small victory over the english at the battle of glen trool before defeating aymer de valence nd earl of pembroke at the battle of loudoun hill at the same time james douglas made his first foray for bruce into southwestern scotland attacking and burning his own castle in douglasdale leaving his brother edward in command in galloway bruce travelled north capturing inverlochy and urquhart castles burning inverness castle and nairn to the ground then unsuccessfully threatening elgin transferring operations to aberdeenshire in late  he threatened banff before falling seriously ill probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign recovering leaving john comyn rd earl of buchan unsubdued at his rear bruce returned west to take balvenie and duffus castles then tarradale castle on the black isle looping back via the hinterlands of inverness and a second failed attempt to take elgin bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of comyn at the battle of inverurie in may  he then overran buchan and defeated the english garrison at aberdeen the harrying of buchan in  was ordered by bruce to make sure all comyn family support was extinguished buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern scotland and much of its population was loyal to the comyn family even after the defeat of the earl of buchan most of the comyn castles in moray aberdeen and buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed bruce ordered similar harryings in argyle and kintyre in the territories of clan macdougall with these acts bruce had successfully destroyed the power of the comyns which had controlled much of northern and southwestern scotland for over a hundred and fifty years he then crossed to argyll and defeated the macdougalls allies of the comyns at the battle of pass of brander and took dunstaffnage castle the last major stronghold of the comyns in march  bruce held his first parliament at st andrews and by august he controlled all of scotland north of the river tay the following year the clergy of scotland recognised bruce as king at a general council the support given to him by the church in spite of his excommunication was of great political importance on the  october  bruce wrote to edward ii of england from kildrum in cumbernauld parish trying unsuccessfully to establish peace between scotland and england over the next three years one englishheld castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced linlithgow in  dumbarton in  and perth by bruce himself in january  bruce also made raids into northern england and landing at ramsey in the isle of man then laid siege to castle rushen in castletown capturing it on  june  and denying the islands strategic importance to the english the eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the english on even ground have caused many to consider bruce as one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age this represented a transformation for one raised as a feudal knight battle of bannockburnedit depiction of the battle of bannockburn in  from the holkham bible main article battle of bannockburn by  robert i had recaptured most of the castles in scotland once held by the english and was sending raiding parties into northern england as far as carlisle in response edward ii planned a major military campaign with the support of lancaster and the barons mustering a large army between  and  strong in the spring of  edward bruce laid siege to stirling castle a key fortification in scotland whose governor philip de mowbray agreed to capitulate if not relieved before  june  in march james douglas captured roxburgh and randolph captured edinburgh castle while in may bruce again raided england and subdued the isle of man news of the agreement regarding stirling castle reached the english king in late may and he decided to speed up his march north from berwick to relieve the castle robert with between  and  troops predominantly spearmen prepared to prevent edwards forces from reaching stirling the battle began on  june as the english army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the bannock burn which was surrounded by marshland skirmishing between the two sides broke out resulting in the death of sir henry de bohun whom robert killed in personal combat edward continued his advance the following day and encountered the bulk of the scottish army as they emerged from the woods of new park the english appear not to have expected the scots to give battle here and as a result had kept their forces in marching rather than battle order with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − at the back of the army rather than the front the english cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by roberts spearmen the english army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control edward ii was dragged away from the battlefield hotly pursued by the scottish forces and only just escaped the heavy fighting the historian roy haines describes the defeat as a calamity of stunning proportions for the english whose losses in the battle were huge in the aftermath of the defeat edward retreated to dunbar then travelled by ship to berwick and then back to york in his absence stirling castle quickly fell midreign –edit bruce reviewing troops before the battle of bannockburn further confrontation with england then the irish conflictedit main article bruce campaign in ireland freed from english threats scotlands armies could now invade northern england bruce also drove back a subsequent english expedition north of the border and launched raids into yorkshire and lancashire buoyed by his military successes bruces forces also invaded ireland in  purportedly to free the country from english rule having received a reply to offers of assistance from donal oneil king of tyrone and to open a second front in the continuing wars with england the irish even crowned edward bruce as high king of ireland in  robert later went there with another army to assist his brother in conjunction with the invasion bruce popularised an ideological vision of a pangaelic greater scotia with his lineage ruling over both ireland and scotland this propaganda campaign was aided by two factors the first was his marriage alliance from  with the de burgh family of the earldom of ulster in ireland second bruce himself on his mothers side of carrick was descended from gaelic royalty in scotland as well as ireland bruces irish ancestors included eva of leinster d whose ancestors included brian boru of munster and the kings of leinster thus lineally and geopolitically bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pangaelic alliance between scottishirish gaelic populations under his kingship this is revealed by a letter he sent to the irish chiefs where he calls the scots and irish collectively nostra nacio our nation stressing the common language customs and heritage of the two peoples whereas we and you and our people and your people free since ancient times share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom we have sent you our beloved kinsman the bearers of this letter to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you so that with gods will our nation nostra nacio may be able to recover her ancient liberty the diplomacy worked to a certain extent at least in ulster where the scots had some support the irish chief donal oneil for instance later justified his support for the scots to pope john xxii by saying the kings of lesser scotia all trace their blood to our greater scotia and retain to some degree our language and customs the bruce campaign in ireland was characterised by some initial military success however the scots failed to win over the nonulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island where people couldnt see the difference between english and scottish occupation eventually it was defeated when edward bruce was killed at the battle of faughart the irish annals of the period described the defeat of the bruces by the english as one of the greatest things ever done for the irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the irish by both the scots and the english later reign –edit the tyninghame copy of the declaration of arbroath the reign of robert bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements the declaration of arbroath of  strengthened his position particularly visàvis the papacy and pope john xxii eventually lifted bruces excommunication in may  king edward iii of england signed the treaty of edinburghnorthampton which recognised scotland as an independent kingdom and bruce as its king in  robert i exchanged lands at cardross for those of old montrose in angus with sir david graham it was to be here that robert would build the manor house that would serve as his favoured residence during the final years of his reign the extant chamberlains accounts for  detail a manor house at cardross with kings and queens chambers and glazed windows a chapel kitchens bake and brewhouses falcon aviary medicinal garden gatehouse protective moat and a hunting park there was also a jetty and beaching area for the kings coble for fishing alongside the kings great shipnb  as most of mainland scotlands major royal castles had remained in their razed state since around – cardross manor was perhaps built as a modest residence sympathetic to roberts subjects privations through a long war repeated famines and livestock pandemics before cardross became habitable in  robert is main residence had been scone abbey robert i had been suffering from a serious illness from at least  the lanercost chronicle and scalacronica state that the king was said to have contracted and died of leprosy jean le bel also stated that in  the king was a victim of la grosse maladie which is usually taken to mean leprosy however the ignorant use of the term leprosy by fourteenthcentury writers meant that almost any major skin disease might be called leprosy the earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eyewitness in ulster at the time the king made a truce with sir henry mandeville on  july  the writer of this letter reported that robert i was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue barbour writes of the kings illness that it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying during the months of wandering from  to  it has been proposed that alternatively he may have suffered from eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or a series of strokes there does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be nor is there any evidence of an attempt in his last years to segregate the king in any way from the company of friends family courtiers or foreign diplomats in october  the pope finally lifted the interdict from scotland and the excommunication of robert i the kings last journey appears to have been a pilgrimage to the shrine of saint ninian at whithorn this was possibly in search of a miraculous cure or to make his peace with god with moray by his side robert set off from his manor at cardross for tarbert on his great ship thence to the isle of arran where he celebrated christmas of  at the hall of glenkill near lamlash thence he sailed to the mainland to visit his son and his bride both mere children now installed at turnberry castle the head of the earldom of carrick and once his own main residence he journeyed overland being carried on a litter to inch in wigtownshire houses were built there and supplies brought to that place as though the kings condition had deteriorated at the end of march  he was staying at glenluce abbey and at monreith from where st ninians cave was visited early in april he arrived at the shrine of st ninian at whithorn he fasted four or five days and prayed to the saint before returning by sea to cardross barbour and other sources relate that robert summoned his prelates and barons to his bedside for a final council at which he made copious gifts to religious houses dispensed silver to religious foundations of various orders so that they might pray for his soul and repented of his failure to fulfil a vow to undertake a crusade to fight the saracens in the holy land roberts final wish reflected conventional piety and was perhaps intended to perpetuate his memory after his death his heart was to be removed from his body and accompanied by a company of knights led by sir james douglas taken on pilgrimage to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem before being interred in melrose abbey upon its return from the holy land i will that as soone as i am trespassed out of this worlde that ye take my harte owte of my body and embawme it and take of my treasoure as ye shall thynke sufficient for that enterprise both for your selfe and suche company as ye wyll take with you and present my hart to the holy sepulchre where as our lorde laye seyng my body can nat come there robert also arranged for perpetual soul masses to be funded at the chapel of saint serf at ayr and at the dominican friary in berwick as well as at dunfermline abbey death edit death and aftermathedit king robert i is buried in dunfermline abbey robert died on  june  at the manor of cardross near dumbarton apart from failing to fulfill a vow to undertake a crusade he died utterly fulfilled in that the goal of his lifetimes struggle—untrammelled recognition of the bruce right to the crown—had been realised and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant moray until his infant son reached adulthood six days after his death to complete his triumph still further papal bulls were issued granting the privilege of unction at the coronation of future kings of scots it remains unclear just what caused the death of robert i a month before his fiftyfifth birthday contemporary accusations that robert suffered from leprosy the unclean sickness—the presentday treatable hansens disease—derived from english and hainault chroniclers none of the scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy penman states that it is very difficult to accept the notion of robert as a functioning king serving in war performing facetoface acts of lordship holding parliament and court travelling widely and fathering several children all while displaying the infectious symptoms of a leper along with suggestions of eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or stroke a diet of rich court food has also been suggested as a possible contributory factor in roberts death his milanese physician maino de maineri did criticise the kings eating of eels as dangerous to his health in advancing years a team of researchers headed by professor andrew nelson from university of western ontario have determined that robert the bruce did not have leprosy during his lifetime they examined the original casting of the skull belonging to robert the bruces descendant lord andrew douglas alexander thomas bruce and a foot bone that had not been reinterned they determined that skull and foot bone showed no signs of leprosy such as an eroded nasal spine and a pencilling of the foot bone burialedit the kings body was embalmed at cardross and his sternum was sawn open to allow extraction of the heart which sir james douglas placed in a silver casket to be worn on a chain around his neck with sir simon locard holding the key roberts viscera were interred in the chapel of saint serf near cardross the ruins of which are located in the presentday levengrove park in dumbarton the kings body was carried east from cardross by a carriage decked in black lawn cloth with stops recorded at dunipace and cambuskenneth abbey the funeral was a grand affair with  stone  kg of wax having been purchased for the making of funerary candles a file of mourners on foot including robert stewart and a number of knights dressed in black gowns accompanied the funeral party into dunfermline abbey a canopy chapel or hearse of imported baltic wood was erected over the grave robert is body in a wooden coffin was then interred within a stone vault beneath the floor underneath a box tomb of white italian marble purchased in paris by thomas of chartres after june  a plinth of black fossiliferous limestone from frosterley topped this structure and atop this plinth was a white alabaster effigy of robert i painted and gilded the following latin epitaph was inscribed around the top of the tomb hic jacet invictus robertus rex benedictus qui sua gesta legit repetit quot bella peregit ad libertatem perduxit per probitatem regnum scottorum nunc vivat in arce polorum here lies the invincible blessed king robert  whoever reads about his feats will repeat the many battles he fought  by his integrity he guided to liberty the kingdom of the scots may he now live in heaven ten alabaster fragments from the tomb are on display in the national museum of scotland and traces of gilding still remain on some of them robert had bequeathed sufficient funds to pay for thousands of obituary masses in dunfermline abbey and elsewhere and his tomb would thus be the site of daily votive prayers when a projected international crusade failed to materialise sir james douglas and his company escorting the casket containing bruces heart sailed to spain where alfonso xi of castile was mounting a campaign against the moorish kingdom of granada according to john barbour douglas and his companions including sir william de keith sir simon locard sir william de st clair of rosslyn and the brothers sir robert logan of restalrig and sir walter logan were welcomed cordially by king alfonso in august  the scots contingent formed part of the castilian army besieging the frontier castle of teba under circumstances which are still disputed sir james and most of his companions were killed the sources all agree that outnumbered and separated from the main christian army a group of scots knights led by douglas was overwhelmed and wiped out the surviving members including sir simon locard of the company recovered douglas body together with the casket containing bruces heart the heart together with douglas bones were brought back to scotland in accordance with bruces written request the heart was buried at melrose abbey in roxburghshire in  the heart was discovered by archaeologists and was reburied but the location was not marked in  a casket was unearthed during construction work scientific study by aoc archaeologists in edinburgh demonstrated that it did indeed contain human tissue and it was of appropriate age it was reburied in melrose abbey in  pursuant to the dying wishes of the king discovery of the bruces tombedit main article dunfermline abbey plaster cast of robert is skull by william scoular on  february  workmen breaking ground on the new parish church to be built on the site of the eastern choir of dunfermline abbey uncovered a vault before the site of the former abbey high altar the vault was covered by two large flat stones—one forming a headstone and a larger stone six feet  cm in length with six iron rings or handles set in it when these stones were removed the vault was found to be seven feet  cm in length  cm wide and  cm deep within the vault inside the remnants of a decayed oak coffin there was a body entirely enclosed in lead with a decayed shroud of cloth of gold over it over the head of the body the lead was formed into the shape of a crown fragments of marble and alabaster had been found in the debris around the site of the vault several years earlier which were linked to robert the bruces recorded purchase of a marble and alabaster tomb made in paris the barons of exchequer ordered that the vault was to be secured from all further inspection with new stones and iron bars and guarded by the town constables and that once the walls of the new church were built up around the site an investigation of the vault and the remains could take place accordingly on  november  the investigation took place the cloth of gold shroud and the lead covering were found to be in a rapid state of decay since the vault had first been opened  months earlier the body was raised up and placed on a wooden coffin board on the edge of the vault it was found to be covered in two thin layers of lead each around  mm thick the lead was removed and the skeleton was inspected by james gregory and alexander monro professor of anatomy at the university of edinburgh the sternum was found to have been sawn open from top to bottom permitting removal of the kings heart after death a plaster cast was taken of the detached skull by artist william scoular the bones were measured and drawn and the kings skeleton was measured to be  feet  inches  cm it has been estimated that bruce may have stood at around  feet  inch  cm tall as a young man which by medieval standards was impressive at this height he would have stood almost as tall as edward i  feet  inches  cm the skeleton lying on the wooden coffin board was then placed upon the top of a lead coffin and the large crowd of curious people who had assembled outside the church were allowed to file past the vault to view the kings remains it was at this point in the proceedings that some small relics—teeth and finger bones—were allegedly removed from the skeleton the published accounts of eyewitnesses such as henry jardine and james gregory confirm the removal of small objects at this time robert the bruces remains were ceremonially reinterred in the vault in dunfermline abbey on  november  they were placed in a new lead coffin into which was poured  lbs of molten pitch to preserve the remains before the coffin was sealed a number of reconstructions of the face of robert the bruce have been produced including those by richard neave from

third attempt inspired by this bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the english thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory the story serves to illustrate the maxim if at first

his manor of lintalee which was then occupied by the english the entire account may in fact be a version of a literary trope used in royal biographical writing a similar story is told for example in jewish sources about king david and in persian folklore about the mongolian warlord tamerlane and an ant it is said that before the battle of bannockburn bruce was attacked by the english knight sir henry de bohun riding with the heavy cavalry de bohun caught sight of bruce who was armed only with his battleaxe de bohun lowered his lance and charged and bruce stood his ground at the last moment bruce swiftly dodged the lance raised in his saddle and with one mighty swing of his axe struck bohun so hard that he split his iron helmet and his head in two so powerful that it shattered the very weapon into pieces afterwards the king merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe to this day the story stands in folklore as a testament of the scottish people and

during the first war of scottish independence against england he fought successfully during his reign to regain scotlands place as an independent country and is today revered in scotland as a national hero descended from the anglonorman and gaelic nobilities his paternal fourthgreat grandfather was king david i roberts grandfather robert de brus th lord of annandale was one of the claimants to the scottish throne during the great cause as earl of carrick robert the bruce supported his familys claim to the scottish throne and took part in william wallaces revolt against edward i of england appointed in  as a guardian of scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne john comyn lord of badenoch and william lamberton bishop of st andrews robert later resigned in  due to his quarrels with comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of king john balliol after submitting to edward i in  and returning to the kings peace robert inherited his familys claim to the scottish throne upon his fathers death in february  robert the bruce killed comyn following an argument and was excommunicated by the pope although he received absolution from robert wishart bishop of glasgow bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of scots on  march  edward is forces defeated robert in battle forcing him to flee into hiding in the hebrides and ireland before returning in  to defeat an english army at loudoun hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the english bruce defeated his other scots enemies destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands and in  held his first parliament a series of military victories between  and  won him control of much of scotland and at the battle of bannockburn in  robert defeated a much larger english army under edward ii of england confirming the reestablishment of an independent scottish kingdom the battle marked a significant turning point with roberts armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern england while also extending his war against the english to ireland by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the native irish to rise against edward iis rule despite bannockburn and the capture of the final english stronghold at berwick in  edward ii refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of scotland in  the scottish nobility submitted the declaration of arbroath to pope john xxii declaring robert as their rightful monarch and asserting scotlands status as an independent kingdom in  the pope recognised robert i as king of an independent scotland and in  the

line arrived in scotland with david i in  and was given the lands of annandale in dumfries and galloway robert i was one of the ten children and the eldest son of robert de brus th lord of annandale and marjorie countess of carrick and claimed the scottish throne as a fourth greatgrandson of david i his mother was by all accounts a formidable woman who legend would have it kept robert bruces father captive until he agreed to marry her from his mother he inherited the earldom of carrick and through his father a royal lineage that would give him a claim to the scottish throne the bruces also held substantial estates in aberdeenshire county antrim county durham essex middlesex and yorkshire early life –edit birthedit the remains of turnberry castle robert the bruces likely birthplace although robert the bruces date of birth is known his place of birth is less certain although it is most likely to have been turnberry castle in ayrshire the head of his mothers earldomnb  childhoodedit very little is known of his youth he was probably brought up in a mixture of the anglonorman culture of northern england and southeastern scotland and the gaelic culture of southwest scotland and most of scotland north of the river forth annandale was thoroughly feudalised and the form of northern middle english that would later develop into the scots language was spoken throughout the region carrick was historically an integral part of galloway and though the earls of carrick had achieved some feudalisation the society of carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically celtic and gaelic speaking robert the bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age he would have been schooled to speak read and possibly write in the anglonorman language of his scotsnorman peers and his fathers family he would also have spoken both the gaelic language of his carrick birthplace and his mothers family and the early scots language as the heir to a considerable estate and a pious layman robert would also have been given working knowledge of latin the language of charter lordship liturgy and prayer this would have afforded robert and his brothers access to basic education in the law politics scripture saints lives vitae philosophy history and chivalric instruction and romance that robert took personal pleasure in such learning and leisure is suggested in a number of ways barbour reported that robert read aloud to his band of supporters in  reciting from memory tales from a twelfthcentury romance of charlemagne fierabras as well as relating examples from history such as hannibals defiance of rome as king robert certainly commissioned verse to commemorate bannockburn and his subjects military deeds contemporary chroniclers jean le bel and thomas grey would both assert that they had read a history of his reign commissioned by king robert himself in his last years robert would pay for dominican friars to tutor his son david for whom he would also purchase books a parliamentary briefing document of c would also assert that robert used continually to read or have read in his presence the histories of ancient kings and princes and how they conducted themselves in their times both in wartime and in peacetime from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule tutors for the young robert and his brothers were most likely drawn from unbeneficed clergy or mendicant friars associated with the churches patronised by their family however as growing noble youths outdoor pursuits and great events would also have held a strong fascination for robert and his brothers they would have had masters drawn from their parents household to school them in the arts of horsemanship swordsmanship the joust hunting and perhaps aspects of courtly behaviour including dress protocol speech table etiquette music and dance some of which may have been learned before the age of ten while serving as pages in their fathers or grandfathers household as many of these personal and leadership skills were bound up within a code of chivalry roberts chief tutor was surely a reputable experienced knight drawn from his grandfathers crusade retinue this grandfather known to contemporaries as robert the noble and to history as bruce the competitor seems to have been an immense influence on the future king roberts later performance in war certainly underlines his skills in tactics and single combat the family would have moved between the castles of their lordships—lochmaben castle the main castle of the lordship of annandale and turnberry and loch doon castle the castles of the earldom of carrick a significant and profound part of the childhood experience of robert edward and possibly the other bruce brothers neil thomas and alexander was also gained through the gaelic tradition of being fostered to allied gaelic kindreds—a traditional practice in carrick southwest and western scotland the hebrides and ireland there were a number of carrick ayrshire hebridean and irish families and kindreds affiliated with the bruces who might have performed such a service roberts fosterbrother is referred to by barbour as sharing roberts precarious existence as an outlaw in carrick in – this gaelic influence has been cited as a possible explanation for robert the bruces apparent affinity for hobelar warfare using smaller sturdy ponies in mounted raids as well as for seapower ranging from oared wargalleys birlinns to boats according to historians such as barrow and penman it is also likely that when robert and edward bruce reached the male age of consent of twelve and began training for full knighthood they were sent to reside for a period with one or more allied english noble families such as the de clares of gloucester or perhaps even in the english royal household sir thomas grey asserted in his scalacronica that in about  robert the bruce then aged eighteen was a young bachelor of king edwards chamber while there remains little firm evidence of roberts presence at edwards court on  april  both robert and his father were pursued through the english chancery for their private household debts of £ by several merchants of winchester this raises the possibility that young robert the bruce was on occasion resident in a royal centre which edward i himself would visit frequently during his reign roberts first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by alexander og macdonald lord of islay his name appears in the company of the bishop of argyll the vicar of arran a kintyre clerk his father and a host of gaelic notaries from carrick robert bruce the king to be was sixteen years of age when margaret maid of norway died in  it is also around this time that robert would have been knighted and he began to appear on the political stage in the bruce dynastic interest the great causeedit roberts mother died early in  in november of the same year edward i of england on behalf of the guardians of scotland and following the great cause awarded the vacant crown of scotland to his grandfathers first cousin once removed john balliol almost immediately robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his lordship of annandale and transferred his claim to the scottish throne to his son antedating this statement to  november in turn that son robert de brus th lord of annandale resigned his earldom of carrick to his eldest son robert the future king so as to protect the bruces kingship claim while their middle lord robert the bruces father now held only english lands while the bruces bid for the throne had ended in failure the balliols triumph propelled the eighteenyearold robert the bruce onto the political stage in his own right earl of carrick –edit the bruces regroupedit robert the bruce and isabella of mar as depicted in the  forman armorial even after johns accession edward still continued to assert his authority over scotland and relations between the two kings soon began to deteriorate the bruces sided with king edward against king john and his comyn allies robert the bruce and his father both considered john a usurper against the objections of the scots edward i agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of the guardians that had governed scotland during the interregnum a further provocation came in a case brought by macduff son of malcolm earl of fife in which edward demanded that john appear in person before the english parliament to answer the charges this the scottish king did but the final straw was edwards demand that the scottish magnates provide military service in englands war against france this was unacceptable the scots instead formed an alliance with france the comyndominated council acting in the name of king john summoned the scottish host to meet at caddonlee on  march the bruces and the earls of angus and march refused and the bruce family withdrew temporarily from scotland while the comyns seized their estates in annandale and carrick granting them to john comyn earl of buchan edward i thereupon provided a safe refuge for the bruces having appointed the lord of annandale to the command of carlisle castle in october  at some point in early  robert married his first wife isabella of mar the daughter of domhnall i earl of mar and his wife helen beginning of the wars of independenceedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message almost the first blow in the war between scotland and england was a direct attack on the bruces on  march  easter monday seven scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of carlisle which was not so much an attack against england as the comyn earl of buchan and their faction attacking their bruce enemies both his father and grandfather were at one time governors of the castle and following the loss of annandale to comyn in  it was their principal residence robert bruce would have gained firsthand knowledge of the citys defences the next time carlisle was besieged in  robert the bruce would be leading the attack edward i responded to king johns alliance with france and the attack on carlisle by invading scotland at the end of march  and taking the town of berwick in a particularly bloody attack upon the flimsy palisades at the battle of dunbar scottish resistance was effectively crushed edward deposed king john placed him in the tower of london and installed englishmen to govern the country the campaign had been very successful but the english triumph would only be temporary although the bruces were by now back in possession of annandale and carrick in august  robert bruce lord of annandale and his son robert bruce earl of carrick and future king were among the more than  scots at berwick who swore an oath of fealty to king edward i of england when the scottish revolt against edward i broke out in july  james stewart th high steward of scotland led into rebellion a group of disaffected scots including robert wishart bishop of glasgow macduff the son of the earl of fife and the young robert bruce the future king was now twentytwo and in joining the rebels he seems to have been acting independently of his father who took no part in the rebellion and appears to have abandoned annandale once more for the safety of carlisle it appears that robert bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfathers friends wishart and stewart who had inspired him to resistance with the outbreak of the revolt robert left carlisle and made his way to annandale where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and according to the english chronicler walter of guisborough addressed them thus no man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and i am no exception i must join my own people and the nation in which i was born i ask that you please come with me and you will be my councillors and close comrades urgent letters were sent ordering bruce to support edwards commander john de warenne th earl of surrey to whom bruce was related in the summer of  but instead of complying bruce continued to support the revolt against edward i that bruce was in the forefront of fomenting rebellion is shown in a letter written to edward by hugh cressingham on  july  which reports the opinion that if you had the earl of carrick the steward of scotland and his brotheryou would think your business done on  july bruce and his friends made terms with edward by a treaty called the capitulation of irvine the scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to king edward the bishop of glasgow james the steward and sir alexander lindsay became sureties for bruce until he delivered his infant daughter marjorie as a hostage which he never did when king edward returned to england after his victory at the battle of falkirk the bruces possessions were excepted from the lordships and lands that edward assigned to his followers the reason for this is uncertain though fordun records robert fighting for edward at falkirk under the command of antony bek bishop of durham annandale and carrick this participation is contested as no bruce appears on the falkirk roll of nobles present in the english army and two th century antiquarians alexander murison and george chalmers have stated bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste annandale and burn ayr castle to prevent it being garrisoned by the english guardianedit william wallace resigned as guardian of scotland after his defeat at the battle of falkirk he was succeeded by robert bruce and john comyn as joint guardians but they could not see past their personal differences as a nephew and supporter of king john and as someone with a serious claim to the scottish throne comyn was bruces enemy in  william lamberton bishop of st andrews was appointed as a third neutral guardian to try to maintain order between bruce and comyn the following year bruce finally resigned as joint guardian and was replaced by sir gilbert de umfraville earl of angus in may  umfraville comyn and lamberton also resigned as joint guardians and were replaced by sir john de soules as sole guardian soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the bruce nor the comyn camps and was a patriot he was an active guardian and made renewed efforts to have king john returned to the scottish throne in july  king edward i launched his sixth campaign into scotland though he captured the castles of bothwell and turnberry he did little to damage the scots fighting ability and in january  he agreed to a ninemonth truce it was around this time that robert the bruce submitted to edward along with other nobles even though he had been on the side of the scots until then there were rumours that john balliol would return to regain the scottish throne soules who had probably been appointed by john supported his return as did most other nobles but it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it in march  bruce sent a letter to the monks at melrose abbey apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national callup bruce pledged that henceforth he would never again require the monks to serve unless it was to the common army of the whole realm for national defence bruce also married his second wife that year elizabeth de burgh the daughter of richard de burgh nd earl of ulster by elizabeth he had four children david ii john died in childhood matilda who married thomas isaac and died at aberdeen  july  and margaret who married william de moravia th earl of sutherland in  in  edward invaded again reaching edinburgh before marching to perth edward stayed in perth until july then proceeded via dundee brechin and montrose to aberdeen where he arrived in august from there he marched through moray to badenoch before retracing his path back south to dunfermline with the country now under submission all the leading scots except for william wallace surrendered to edward in february  john comyn who was by now guardian submitted to edward the laws and liberties of scotland were to be as they had been in the days of alexander iii and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of king edward and the advice of the scots nobles on  june  bruce and william lamberton made a pact that bound them each to the other in friendship and alliance against all men if one should break the secret pact he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds the pact is often interpretedby whom as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the english homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the english parliament to establish rules for the governance of scotland the earl of richmond edwards nephew was to head up the subordinate government of scotland while all this took place william wallace was finally captured near glasgow and he was hanged drawn and quartered in london on  august  in september  edward ordered robert bruce to put his castle at kildrummy in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for suggesting that king edward suspected robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back however an identical phrase appears in an agreement between edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend aymer de valence a further sign of edwards distrust occurred on  october  when edward revoked his gift of sir gilbert de umfravilles lands to bruce that he had made only six months before robert bruce as earl of carrick and now th lord of annandale held huge estates and property in scotland and a barony and some minor properties in england and a strong claim to the scottish throne murder of john comynedit the killing of comyn in the greyfriars church in dumfries as imagined by felix philippoteaux a thcentury illustrator bruce like all his family had a complete belief in his right to the throne however his actions of supporting alternately the english and scottish armies had led to a great deal of distrust towards bruce among the community of the realm of scotland his ambition was further thwarted by john comyn who had been much more resolute in his opposition to the english comyn was the most powerful noble in scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within scotland and england including relatives that held the earldoms of buchan mar ross fife angus dunbar and strathearn the lordships of kilbride kirkintilloch lenzie bedrule and scraesburgh and sheriffdoms in banff dingwall wigtown and aberdeen he also had a powerful claim to the scottish throne through his descent from donald iii on his fathers side and david i on his mothers side comyn was the nephew of john balliol according to barbour and fordoun in the late summer of  in a secret agreement sworn signed and sealed john comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the scottish throne in favour of robert bruce upon receipt of the bruce lands in scotland should an uprising occur led by bruce whether the details of the agreement with comyn are correct or not king edward moved to arrest bruce while bruce was still at the english court fortunately for bruce his friend and edwards soninlaw ralph de monthermer learnt of edwards intention and warned bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs bruce took the hint and he and a squire fled the english court during the night they made their way quickly for scotland according to barbour comyn betrayed his agreement with bruce to king edward i and when bruce arranged a meeting for  february  with comyn in the chapel of greyfriars monastery in dumfries and accused him of treachery they came to blows bruce stabbed comyn before the high altar the scotichronicon says that on being told that comyn had survived the attack and was being treated two of bruces supporters roger de kirkpatrick uttering the words i mak siccar i make sure and john lindsay went back into the church and finished bruces work barbour however tells no such story bruce asserted his claim to the scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of scotland bruce and his party then attacked dumfries castle where the english garrison surrendered bruce hurried from dumfries to glasgow where his friend and supporter bishop robert wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to bruce nonetheless bruce was excommunicated for this crime english records still in existence today tell a completely different story they state that the comyn murder was planned in an attempt to gain the throne of scotland for this reason king edward of england wrote to the pope and asked for his excommunication of robert bruce no records have ever been found in england stating that king edward had any knowledge of treachery by robert bruce before his acts against comyn they state that king edward did not hear of the murder of john comyn until several days after his deathcitation needed early reign –edit war of robert iedit bruce crowned king of scots modern tableau at edinburgh castle six weeks after comyn was killed in dumfries bruce was crowned king of scots by bishop william de lamberton at scone near perth on  march  with all formality and solemnity the royal robes and vestments that robert wishart had hidden from the english were brought out by the bishop and set upon king robert the bishops of moray and glasgow were in attendance as well as the earls of atholl menteith lennox and mar the great banner of the kings of scotland was planted behind his throne isabella macduff countess of buchan and wife of john comyn rd earl of buchan a cousin of the murdered john comyn arrived the next day too late for the coronation she claimed the right of her family the macduff earl of fife to crown the scottish king for her brother donnchadh iv earl of fife who was not yet of age and in english hands so a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of robert bruce earl of carrick lord of annandale king of the scots in june  bruce was defeated at the battle of methven his wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to kildrummy in august  under the protection of bruces brother neil bruce and the earl of atholl and most of his remaining men bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men including sir james douglas and gilbert hay bruces brothers thomas alexander and edward as well as sir neil campbell and the earl of lennox edward i marched north again in the spring on his way he granted the scottish estates of bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating bruce bruces queen elizabeth his daughter marjorie his sisters christina and mary and isabella macduff were captured in a sanctuary at tain and sent to harsh imprisonment which included mary and isabella being hung in cages at roxburgh and berwick castles respectively for about four years while bruces brother neil was executed by being hanged drawn and quartered on  july king edward i died leaving bruce opposed by the kings son edward ii bruce in jungle it is still uncertain where bruce spent the winter of – most likely he spent it in the hebrides possibly sheltered by christina of garmoran who was married to bruces brotherinlaw duncan the brother of bruces first wife isabella of mar ireland is also a serious possibility and orkney under norwegian rule at the time or norway proper where his sister isabel bruce was queen dowager although unlikely are not impossible bruce and his followers returned to the scottish mainland in february in two groups one led by bruce and his brother edward landed at turnberry castle and began a guerrilla war in southwest scotland the other led by his brothers thomas and alexander landed slightly further south in loch ryan but they were soon captured and executed in april bruce won a small victory over the english at the battle of glen trool before defeating aymer de valence nd earl of pembroke at the battle of loudoun hill at the same time james douglas made his first foray for bruce into southwestern scotland attacking and burning his own castle in douglasdale leaving his brother edward in command in galloway bruce travelled north capturing inverlochy and urquhart castles burning inverness castle and nairn to the ground then unsuccessfully threatening elgin transferring operations to aberdeenshire in late  he threatened banff before falling seriously ill probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign recovering leaving john comyn rd earl of buchan unsubdued at his rear bruce returned west to take balvenie and duffus castles then tarradale castle on the black isle looping back via the hinterlands of inverness and a second failed attempt to take elgin bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of comyn at the battle of inverurie in may  he then overran buchan and defeated the english garrison at aberdeen the harrying of buchan in  was ordered by bruce to make sure all comyn family support was extinguished buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern scotland and much of its population was loyal to the comyn family even after the defeat of the earl of buchan most of the comyn castles in moray aberdeen and buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed bruce ordered similar harryings in argyle and kintyre in the territories of clan macdougall with these acts bruce had successfully destroyed the power of the comyns which had controlled much of northern and southwestern scotland for over a hundred and fifty years he then crossed to argyll and defeated the macdougalls allies of the comyns at the battle of pass of brander and took dunstaffnage castle the last major stronghold of the comyns in march  bruce held his first parliament at st andrews and by august he controlled all of scotland north of the river tay the following year the clergy of scotland recognised bruce as king at a general council the support given to him by the church in spite of his excommunication was of great political importance on the  october  bruce wrote to edward ii of england from kildrum in cumbernauld parish trying unsuccessfully to establish peace between scotland and england over the next three years one englishheld castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced linlithgow in  dumbarton in  and perth by bruce himself in january  bruce also made raids into northern england and landing at ramsey in the isle of man then laid siege to castle rushen in castletown capturing it on  june  and denying the islands strategic importance to the english the eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the english on even ground have caused many to consider bruce as one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age this represented a transformation for one raised as a feudal knight battle of bannockburnedit depiction of the battle of bannockburn in  from the holkham bible main article battle of bannockburn by  robert i had recaptured most of the castles in scotland once held by the english and was sending raiding parties into northern england as far as carlisle in response edward ii planned a major military campaign with the support of lancaster and the barons mustering a large army between  and  strong in the spring of  edward bruce laid siege to stirling castle a key fortification in scotland whose governor philip de mowbray agreed to capitulate if not relieved before  june  in march james douglas captured roxburgh and randolph captured edinburgh castle while in may bruce again raided england and subdued the isle of man news of the agreement regarding stirling castle reached the english king in late may and he decided to speed up his march north from berwick to relieve the castle robert with between  and  troops predominantly spearmen prepared to prevent edwards forces from reaching stirling the battle began on  june as the english army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the bannock burn which was surrounded by marshland skirmishing between the two sides broke out resulting in the death of sir henry de bohun whom robert killed in personal combat edward continued his advance the following day and encountered the bulk of the scottish army as they emerged from the woods of new park the english appear not to have expected the scots to give battle here and as a result had kept their forces in marching rather than battle order with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − at the back of the army rather than the front the english cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by roberts spearmen the english army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control edward ii was dragged away from the battlefield hotly pursued by the scottish forces and only just escaped the heavy fighting the historian roy haines describes the defeat as a calamity of stunning proportions for the english whose losses in the battle were huge in the aftermath of the defeat edward retreated to dunbar then travelled by ship to berwick and then back to york in his absence stirling castle quickly fell midreign –edit bruce reviewing troops before the battle of bannockburn further confrontation with england then the irish conflictedit main article bruce campaign in ireland freed from english threats scotlands armies could now invade northern england bruce also drove back a subsequent english expedition north of the border and launched raids into yorkshire and lancashire buoyed by his military successes bruces forces also invaded ireland in  purportedly to free the country from english rule having received a reply to offers of assistance from donal oneil king of tyrone and to open a second front in the continuing wars with england the irish even crowned edward bruce as high king of ireland in  robert later went there with another army to assist his brother in conjunction with the invasion bruce popularised an ideological vision of a pangaelic greater scotia with his lineage ruling over both ireland and scotland this propaganda campaign was aided by two factors the first was his marriage alliance from  with the de burgh family of the earldom of ulster in ireland second bruce himself on his mothers side of carrick was descended from gaelic royalty in scotland as well as ireland bruces irish ancestors included eva of leinster d whose ancestors included brian boru of munster and the kings of leinster thus lineally and geopolitically bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pangaelic alliance between scottishirish gaelic populations under his kingship this is revealed by a letter he sent to the irish chiefs where he calls the scots and irish collectively nostra nacio our nation stressing the common language customs and heritage of the two peoples whereas we and you and our people and your people free since ancient times share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom we have sent you our beloved kinsman the bearers of this letter to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you so that with gods will our nation nostra nacio may be able to recover her ancient liberty the diplomacy worked to a certain extent at least in ulster where the scots had some support the irish chief donal oneil for instance later justified his support for the scots to pope john xxii by saying the kings of lesser scotia all trace their blood to our greater scotia and retain to some degree our language and customs the bruce campaign in ireland was characterised by some initial military success however the scots failed to win over the nonulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island where people couldnt see the difference between english and scottish occupation eventually it was defeated when edward bruce was killed at the battle of faughart the irish annals of the period described the defeat of the bruces by the english as one of the greatest things ever done for the irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the irish by both the scots and the english later reign –edit the tyninghame copy of the declaration of arbroath the reign of robert bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements the declaration of arbroath of  strengthened his position particularly visàvis the papacy and pope john xxii eventually lifted bruces excommunication in may  king edward iii of england signed the treaty of edinburghnorthampton which recognised scotland as an independent kingdom and bruce as its king in  robert i exchanged lands at cardross for those of old montrose in angus with sir david graham it was to be here that robert would build the manor house that would serve as his favoured residence during the final years of his reign the extant chamberlains accounts for  detail a manor house at cardross with kings and queens chambers and glazed windows a chapel kitchens bake and brewhouses falcon aviary medicinal garden gatehouse protective moat and a hunting park there was also a jetty and beaching area for the kings coble for fishing alongside the kings great shipnb  as most of mainland scotlands major royal castles had remained in their razed state since around – cardross manor was perhaps built as a modest residence sympathetic to roberts subjects privations through a long war repeated famines and livestock pandemics before cardross became habitable in  robert is main residence had been scone abbey robert i had been suffering from a serious illness from at least  the lanercost chronicle and scalacronica state that the king was said to have contracted and died of leprosy jean le bel also stated that in  the king was a victim of la grosse maladie which is usually taken to mean leprosy however the ignorant use of the term leprosy by fourteenthcentury writers meant that almost any major skin disease might be called leprosy the earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eyewitness in ulster at the time the king made a truce with sir henry mandeville on  july  the writer of this letter reported that robert i was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue barbour writes of the kings illness that it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying during the months of wandering from  to  it has been proposed that alternatively he may have suffered from eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or a series of strokes there does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be nor is there any evidence of an attempt in his last years to segregate the king in any way from the company of friends family courtiers or foreign diplomats in october  the pope finally lifted the interdict from scotland and the excommunication of robert i the kings last journey appears to have been a pilgrimage to the shrine of saint ninian at whithorn this was possibly in search of a miraculous cure or to make his peace with god with moray by his side robert set off from his manor at cardross for tarbert on his great ship thence to the isle of arran where he celebrated christmas of  at the hall of glenkill near lamlash thence he sailed to the mainland to visit his son and his bride both mere children now installed at turnberry castle the head of the earldom of carrick and once his own main residence he journeyed overland being carried on a litter to inch in wigtownshire houses were built there and supplies brought to that place as though the kings condition had deteriorated at the end of march  he was staying at glenluce abbey and at monreith from where st ninians cave was visited early in april he arrived at the shrine of st ninian at whithorn he fasted four or five days and prayed to the saint before returning by sea to cardross barbour and other sources relate that robert summoned his prelates and barons to his bedside for a final council at which he made copious gifts to religious houses dispensed silver to religious foundations of various orders so that they might pray for his soul and repented of his failure to fulfil a vow to undertake a crusade to fight the saracens in the holy land roberts final wish reflected conventional piety and was perhaps intended to perpetuate his memory after his death his heart was to be removed from his body and accompanied by a company of knights led by sir james douglas taken on pilgrimage to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem before being interred in melrose abbey upon its return from the holy land i will that as soone as i am trespassed out of this worlde that ye take my harte owte of my body and embawme it and take of my treasoure as ye shall thynke sufficient for that enterprise both for your selfe and suche company as ye wyll take with you and present my hart to the holy sepulchre where as our lorde laye seyng my body can nat come there robert also arranged for perpetual soul masses to be funded at the chapel of saint serf at ayr and at the dominican friary in berwick as well as at dunfermline abbey death edit death and aftermathedit king robert i is buried in dunfermline abbey robert died on  june  at the manor of cardross near dumbarton apart from failing to fulfill a vow to undertake a crusade he died utterly fulfilled in that the goal of his lifetimes struggle—untrammelled recognition of the bruce right to the crown—had been realised and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant moray until his infant son reached adulthood six days after his death to complete his triumph still further papal bulls were issued granting the privilege of unction at the coronation of future kings of scots it remains unclear just what caused the death of robert i a month before his fiftyfifth birthday contemporary accusations that robert suffered from leprosy the unclean sickness—the presentday treatable hansens disease—derived from english and hainault chroniclers none of the scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy penman states that it is very difficult to accept the notion of robert as a functioning king serving in war performing facetoface acts of lordship holding parliament and court travelling widely and fathering several children all while displaying the infectious symptoms of a leper along with suggestions of eczema tuberculosis syphilis motor neurone disease cancer or stroke a diet of rich court food has also been suggested as a possible contributory factor in roberts death his milanese physician maino de maineri did criticise the kings eating of eels as dangerous to his health in advancing years a team of researchers headed by professor andrew nelson from university of western ontario have determined that robert the bruce did not have leprosy during his lifetime they examined the original casting of the skull belonging to robert the bruces descendant lord andrew douglas alexander thomas bruce and a foot bone that had not been reinterned they determined that skull and foot bone showed no signs of leprosy such as an eroded nasal spine and a pencilling of the foot bone burialedit the kings body was embalmed at cardross and his sternum was sawn open to allow extraction of the heart which sir james douglas placed in a silver casket to be worn on a chain around his neck with sir simon locard holding the key roberts viscera were interred in the chapel of saint serf near cardross the ruins of which are located in the presentday levengrove park in dumbarton the kings body was carried east from cardross by a carriage decked in black lawn cloth with stops recorded at dunipace and cambuskenneth abbey the funeral was a grand affair with  stone  kg of wax having been purchased for the making of funerary candles a file of mourners on foot including robert stewart and a number of knights dressed in black gowns accompanied the funeral party into dunfermline abbey a canopy chapel or hearse of imported baltic wood was erected over the grave robert is body in a wooden coffin was then interred within a stone vault beneath the floor underneath a box tomb of white italian marble purchased in paris by thomas of chartres after june  a plinth of black fossiliferous limestone from frosterley topped this structure and atop this plinth was a white alabaster effigy of robert i painted and gilded the following latin epitaph was inscribed around the top of the tomb hic jacet invictus robertus rex benedictus qui sua gesta legit repetit quot bella peregit ad libertatem perduxit per probitatem regnum scottorum nunc vivat in arce polorum here lies the invincible blessed king robert  whoever reads about his feats will repeat the many battles he fought  by his integrity he guided to liberty the kingdom of the scots may he now live in heaven ten alabaster fragments from the tomb are on display in the national museum of scotland and traces of gilding still remain on some of them robert had bequeathed sufficient funds to pay for thousands of obituary masses in dunfermline abbey and elsewhere and his tomb would thus be the site of daily votive prayers when a projected international crusade failed to materialise sir james douglas and his company escorting the casket containing bruces heart sailed to spain where alfonso xi of castile was mounting a campaign against the moorish kingdom of granada according to john barbour douglas and his companions including sir william de keith sir simon locard sir william de st clair of rosslyn and the brothers sir robert logan of restalrig and sir walter logan were welcomed cordially by king alfonso in august  the scots contingent formed part of the castilian army besieging the frontier castle of teba under circumstances which are still disputed sir james and most of his companions were killed the sources all agree that outnumbered and separated from the main christian army a group of scots knights led by douglas was overwhelmed and wiped out the surviving members including sir simon locard of the company recovered douglas body together with the casket containing bruces heart the heart together with douglas bones were brought back to scotland in accordance with bruces written request the heart was buried at melrose abbey in roxburghshire in  the heart was discovered by archaeologists and was reburied but the location was not marked in  a casket was unearthed during construction work scientific study by aoc archaeologists in edinburgh demonstrated that it did indeed contain human tissue and it was of appropriate age it was reburied in melrose abbey in  pursuant to the dying wishes of the king discovery of the bruces tombedit main article dunfermline abbey plaster cast of robert is skull by william scoular on  february  workmen breaking ground on the new parish church to be built on the site of the eastern choir of dunfermline abbey uncovered a vault before the site of the former abbey high altar the vault was covered by two large flat stones—one forming a headstone and a larger stone six feet  cm in length with six iron rings or handles set in it when these stones were removed the vault was found to be seven feet  cm in length  cm wide and  cm deep within the vault inside the remnants of a decayed oak coffin there was a body entirely enclosed in lead with a decayed shroud of cloth of gold over it over the head of the body the lead was formed into the shape of a crown fragments of marble and alabaster had been found in the debris around the site of the vault several years earlier which were linked to robert the bruces recorded purchase of a marble and alabaster tomb made in paris the barons of exchequer ordered that the vault was to be secured from all further inspection with new stones and iron bars and guarded by the town constables and that once the walls of the new church were built up around the site an investigation of the vault and the remains could take place accordingly on  november  the investigation took place the cloth of gold shroud and the lead covering were found to be in a rapid state of decay since the vault had first been opened  months earlier the body was raised up and placed on a wooden coffin board on the edge of the vault it was found to be covered in two thin layers of lead each around  mm thick the lead was removed and the skeleton was inspected by james gregory and alexander monro professor of anatomy at the university of edinburgh the sternum was found to have been sawn open from top to bottom permitting removal of the kings heart after death a plaster cast was taken of the detached skull by artist william scoular the bones were measured and drawn and the kings skeleton was measured to be  feet  inches  cm it has been estimated that bruce may have stood at around  feet  inch  cm tall as a young man which by medieval standards was impressive at this height he would have stood almost as tall as edward i  feet  inches  cm the skeleton lying on the wooden coffin board was then placed upon the top of a lead coffin and the large crowd of curious people who had assembled outside the church were allowed to file past the vault to view the kings remains it was at this point in the proceedings that some small relics—teeth and finger bones—were allegedly removed from the skeleton the published accounts of eyewitnesses such as henry jardine and james gregory confirm the removal of small objects at this time robert the bruces remains were ceremonially reinterred in the vault in dunfermline abbey on  november  they were placed in a new lead coffin into which was poured  lbs of molten pitch to preserve the remains before the coffin was sealed a number of reconstructions of the face of robert the bruce have been produced including those by richard neave from

north coast of ireland where he observed a spider spinning a web trying to make a connection from one area of the caves roof to another it tried and failed twice but began again and succeeded on the third attempt inspired by this bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the english thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory the story serves to illustrate the maxim if at first you dont succeed try try try again other versions have bruce in a small house watching the spider try to make its connection between two roof beams this legend first appears in a much later account tales of a grandfather by sir walter scottcitation needed and may have originally been told about his companioninarms sir james douglas the black douglas who had spent time hiding out in caves within his manor of lintalee which was then occupied by the english the entire account may in fact be a version of a literary trope used in royal biographical writing a similar story is told for example in jewish sources about king david and in persian folklore about the mongolian warlord tamerlane and an ant it is said that before the battle of bannockburn bruce was attacked by the english knight sir henry de bohun riding with the heavy cavalry de bohun caught sight of bruce who was armed only with his battleaxe de bohun lowered his lance and charged and bruce stood his ground at the last moment bruce swiftly dodged the lance raised in his saddle and with one mighty swing of his axe struck bohun so hard that he split his iron helmet and his head in two so powerful that it shattered the very weapon into pieces afterwards the king merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe to this day the story stands in folklore as a testament of the scottish people and
