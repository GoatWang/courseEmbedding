concern for the phenomenon of paradox in mathematics to hilbert the paradoxes which are at once both absurd and irresistible revealed a deep philosophical truth namely that there is a discrepancy between the laws accord­ ing to which the mind of homo mathematicus works and the laws governing objective mathematical fact mathematical epistemology is therefore to be seen as a struggle between a mind that naturally works in one way and a reality that works in another knowledge occurs when the two cooperate conceived in this way there are two basic alternatives for mathematical epistemology a skeptical position which maintains either that mind and reality seldom or never come to agreement or that we have no very reliable way of telling when they do and a nonskeptical position which holds that there is significant agree­ ment between mind and reality and that their potential discrepan­ cies can be detected avoided and thus kept in check of these two hilbert clearly embraced the latter and proposed a program designed to vindicate the epistemological riches represented by our natural if nonliteral ways of thinking brouwer on the other hand opted for a position closer in hilberts opinion to that of the skeptic having decided that epistemological purity could come only through sacrifice he turned his back on his classical heritage to accept a higher calling show all reviews the
