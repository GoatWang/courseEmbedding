history levys three sons lester milton jr and irvin started working in the company warehouse and shipping areas as teenagers nchs original product line included a coal tar disinfectant an insecticide and a liquid hand soap for institutional use in the late s nch introduced everbrite a heavyduty industrial floor wax everbrite eventually evolved into a multipurpose cleaner that kills bacteria  to edit when milton p levy sr died in 9 his widow ruth levy took over as nch president lester levy assumed control of the small nch sales force milton levy jr developed a sales territory in austin texas and his brother developed another sales territory in dallasfort worth in 9 nch reached  in sales the levys were assisted in running the company by jack mann national disinfectants top sales representative since joining the company in the s mann would stay with nch for  years the nch mantek chemical division was named for mann him after his death in  in the 9s nch began to integrate vertically and to expand its marketing area the company began to reinvest a sizeable portion of its profits in manufacturing and research facilities in order to decrease its reliance on outside producers for its products in the early 9s nch acquired certified laboratories certified continued to operate as an independent company with its own brand name and its own sales force but this wholly owned subsidiary was generating over onefourth of the companys revenue within a few years by the middle of the decade nch was shipping its products by railroad to oklahoma louisiana arizona and new mexico in 9 nch established it first branch office in st louis during this period nch created a sales management team and standardized its sales training nch opened new plants in texas new jersey california puerto rico and indiana  to 9edit in  nch changed its name to national chemsearch corporation to better reflect its current product line during this period nch expanded sales to the caribbean region canada central america south america and europe in 9 nch moved its administrative offices laboratories and manufacturing operations to irving texas that same year nch acquired hallmark chemical corporation which sold a line of building products in 9 nch purchased lamkin brothers inc a marketer of vitamin and mineral supplements for livestock in 9 nch made it first public stock offering however the levy family retained control of nch with a  percent stock holding with ruth levy retired lester levy became chairman of the board overseeing corporate planning and finance milton levy jr handled production distribution and product development as chairman of the executive committee irwin levy was company president and in charge of expanding both domestic and foreign sales  between 9 and 9 nch sales grew at an average rate of 9 percent a year by 9 nch was earning  million on sales of  million much of the companys success was attributed to its direct sales methods which eliminated the need for wholesalers or other intermediaries by offering a broad range of products to a large number of customers many of them relatively small shops and plants nch was able to compete favorably with larger competitors that concentrated on major customers by 9 nch employed more than  sales representatives none of the companys  customers accounted for even one percent of its sales about  percent of these customers were industrial or commercial clients the rest were institutions such as hospitals and schools the greatest share of sales over  percent was still coming from cleaning chemicals at that time constant research was adding about  products a year to the line toward the end of the s nch created the plumbmaster and partsmaster divisions the establishment of these divisions meant that the growing number of newly acquired subsidiaries could be grouped according to the nature of their products in february 99 nch stock was listed on the new york stock exchange for the first time 9 to edit by 9 the nch product line included about  items sold under the names national chemsearch certified mantek and dyna systems fasteners turf maintenance supplies paints and sealers and sewage treatment chemicals were offered along with the growing list of cleaning chemicals nch sales and profits continued to grow slowly into the early 9s by 9 sales had reached 9 million with net income of  million about  percent of the companys revenue derived from foreign sales by this time in 9 nch purchased p  m manufacturing company of los angeles and the pennsylvaniabased daniel p creed co inc in  p  m with annual sales of about  million in the plumbing maintenance industry was acquired for  shares of common stock creed also in the plumbing supply business was a cash purchase by 9 sales at nch reached  million about  sales representatives were handling the companys products by the mid 9s in 9 specialty chemicals accounted for about  percent of sales the remaining  percent was derived from fasteners plumbing parts and welding supplies nchs goal of reducing reliance on outside manufacturers had mainly been achieved by this time as nearly all of the companys specialty chemicals were being fabricated at its own facilities the exception being its turf maintenance products nch annual sales doubled again by  reaching  million the companys changes its name from national chemsearch to nch corporation that year again the rationale was to reflect the increasing diversity of nch product lines in  nch purchased specialty products co a manufacturer of specialty plumbing items specialty products based in stanton california had yearly sales of about  million in 99 nch acquired the domestic assets of american allsafe co this acquisition paved the way for the development of the companys safety equipment division which supplied as eye and head protection gear to the increasingly safetyconscious industrial world in 99 nch launched kernite sa a new trading company in belgium that sold chemicals petrochemicals and lubricants  to edit nchs previously steady growth in sales stalled somewhat in the first half of the s after reaching a high of  million in 9 sales actually declined in each of the next three years and did not surpass the 9 figure until 9 when  million in sales was reported one obvious reason for this stagnation was a generally sluggish global economy in which maintenance supplies were easy targets for the costcutting efforts of struggling industrial firms also the firstyear turnover rate among nch sales representatives was much higher than usual due to slow sales accompanied by higher gas and car maintenance costs which are borne by the sales personnel the size of the sales force was stuck at about  throughout the first half of the decade in 9 nch added direct mail telemarketing and catalog sales to its arsenal of marketing techniques cornerstone direct was formed for this purpose offering material handling equipment firstaid kits and other industrial supplies sales growth returned in the second half of the s breaking  million in 9 and  million in 9 european operations contributed more and more to the companys sales and income during this period with sales up and expenses down nchs earned income from europe quadrupled between 9 and 99 from  million to  million another area that expanded significantly in the last few years of the decade was the companys resource electronics division with the acquisition of three electronic parts distributors between 9 and 9 sales and income reached new peaks of  million and  million in 99 before dropping slightly in 99 one major cost incurred by the company in 99 was the restructuring of its brazilian subsidiary a downsizing made necessary by the phenomenal rate of inflation and general instability of the brazilian economy a new plant was built in korea in 99 making it possible to offer a broader range of products in the growing asian market among nchs acquisitions that year was a line of stainless steel flexible tubing connectors these new products were marketed under the trade name aquaflo by the end of fiscal 99 nchs plumbing group was offering a total of more than  different parts the resource electronics groups line had grown to over  parts by this time as well the company also expanded its line of retail products which by this time included outright brand pet care products out international pet odor eliminators and totally toddler nursery care items a variety of plumbing and hardware supplies for doityourselfers also became available in retail outlets in 99 nch agreed to finance the cleanup of the higgins disposal superfund site a acre location in somerset county new jersey the location was a former dumping site for a waste disposal
