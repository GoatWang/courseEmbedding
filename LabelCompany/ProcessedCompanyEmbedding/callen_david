shelly for her comments shelly ibach good afternoon and thank you for joining our call today my sleepiq score last night was  we are very pleased with consumers continued demand for our brand and products our growth initiatives are producing steady traffic and sales performance demand in the second quarter was ahead of our internal expectation and traffic was again consistent throughout the quarter as it has been all year we are reaffirming our fullyear guidance while demand has remained strong our second quarter results reflect a delay in deliveries and shipments with a corresponding shifted sales into the third quarter net sales of  million were up  over the prior year with a  loss per share these results include  million of delayed shipments that will be delivered in the third quarter for context this represents one week of customer delivery that moved from the second to the third quarter due to a shortage of inventory the reason for this is that production at one of our new suppliers fell short of our demand needs as they scale and work through new specification we now have the necessary inventory levels to fulfill the outstanding second quarter deliveries our suppliers weekly production is also now exceeding our forecasted sales needs for the third quarter and beyond the issue is results and we dont expect a shortage in the future taking a wider view this supplier change was an important one for us to make to achieve our innovation plans and financial goals so although it resulted in some challenges in the quarter it will have no impact on our ability to deliver our plans for the year we have taken numerous actions to reduce the impact on our customers our gross margins in the quarter include these costs yet are still slightly ahead of our expectations due to our ongoing margin expansion initiative i will now provide an update on the four growth catalyst for our brand our execution of these initiatives again resulted in increased traffic conversion and product mix results first we are excited about bringing the revolutionary sleep number  bed to our customers as planned all stores were set with the i and i smart beds by the end of may we kicked off our new marketing campaign called the future of sleep which features the  smart bed in the second week of june demand for our  smart bed is ahead of our expectations in both units and aru customers and our sleep professionals have both responded strongly to the smart bed benefits and features particularly the effortless adjustability sleepiq connectivity and foot warming our design and pricing strategy contemplated increased attach rate of flexfit smart adjustable bases and sleepiq technology and this is what we are experiencing deliveries of the  smart bed began in june and the product has received strong reviews one of our customers in portland said at best i believe it is the best sleep system on the planet we will continue our phased implementation of additional smart beds over the next three quarters we are confident in our actions to drive demand and achieve our goals for the year our second driver of demand is our loyal customers where responding to our newest innovation with enthusiasm both referrals and repeat sales reached record levels in the quarter our centralized database marketing and digital loyalty initiatives are contributing to more effective personalized communications this is leading to increased sales and higher efficiency from both existing and new customers third we again delivered increased media efficiency and effectiveness in the second quarter with yearoveryear media leverage of  basis points we held our spending essentially flat to the prior year based on two factors the efficiency improvement our media buying strategy has garnered this year and the fact that the second quarter is the seasonally lowest sales quarter we continue to expect  basis points of media leverage for the fullyear from a traffic perspective qualified unique visitors to our web site were on plan we drove the higher quality store traffic with record high conversion rates we continue to optimize digital actions in real time as we pursue a medium mix that connects the customers digital experience through to the store purchase our final driver of increasing demand is the extraordinary retail experience associated with our directtoconsumer and exclusive distribution model our strategy is driving both positive comps and new store growth over the longterm in the second quarter new stores contributed  points of growth offset by a negative  comp we advanced our margin expansion initiatives in the quarter and delivered a gross margin rate of  compared with  in prior year these initiatives include supplier transition lean process improvement and manufacturing cost reductions we also executed two hub relocations and piloted fully assembled beds in our irmo south carolina facility we will expand this pilot to our salt lake city facility in q with these changes we will deliver nearly  of our volume fully assembled this year which is consistent with our expectations these advancements are part of a multiyear network reconfiguration that ultimately delivers a more effective and efficient final mile brand experience we continue to expect a record year of operating cash flows in  yeartodate we have generated  million in cash from operations compared with  million the prior year we reinvested  million in capital projects and repurchased  million of shares in the first half compared with  million in the prior year our trailing  months roic at the end of the first half was  well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital our three cash priorities remain investing in our growth financial flexibility and share repurchases in summary we expect to deliver accelerated earnings growth cash generation and returns to shareholders in  the investments we have made in differentiated products digital stores technology and the infrastructure are helping us achieve our longterm business goals and we expect our productivity improvements will drive a mid teen operating profit flow through rate longterm this is an important week for us as we host our national retail conference here in minneapolis we are all excited about the opportunities we have to take market share with the sleep number  smart bed the smart effortlessly sleep bed is enabled by sleepiq technology is a clear differentiator and we intend to capitalize on this momentum with sleep numbers leadership of sleep technology this is an important time to place all of our assets against our powerful sleep number brand to that end we will change our corporate name to sleep number corporation later this year when we relocate our headquarters to downtown minneapolis i want to offer a heartfelt thank you to our team members for their ongoing dedication to our mission of improving customers lives by individualizing sleep experiences and their unwavering passion for innovation now david will provide more details about our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year david callen thank you shelly we continue to advance important profit accelerators across the business to enable delivery of our  eps target of  as shelly detailed we’ve continue to improve the effectiveness of our datadriven marketing tools and are seen strong consumer demand for our revolutionary sleep innovations we expect to complete the phased rollout of our  smart beds over the next three quarters in the first phase we introduced two of our upper end  smart bed models which make up about  of our unit volume as planned beginning in our seasonally slowest quarter gave us room to work through learnings without impacting our performance expectations for  the inventory shortage we had from one of our new suppliers is now resolved while early customers and team members have embraced our  innovations enthusiastically in addition to our demand drivers another important evolution underway is of our supply chain back in november had our investor conference we talked about several facets we’d be addressing to accelerate profits including design to value and design for manufacture  manufacturability through our  smart bed evolution of our outbound logistics network and global sourcing for innovation and profitability our operating teams have delivered meaningful efficiencies while successfully piloting in hub mattress assembly at a new company operated location they’ve also relocated two partner hubs and transition more than  suppliers all but one of these vendors ramped production seamlessly that supplier had productivity challenges that lead to temporary inventory shortages for us in q this shifted a weeks deliveries worth about  million in revenues and  of eps from q to q today those inventory shortages are resolved and the supplier is consistently producing at volumes that exceed our demand plans to balance of the year we are confident in the supply chain advancements we are making and in the partnerships for innovation and profit expansion with our suppliers they are essential to advance our business and to delivering our fullyear and longterm guidance second quarter net sales of  million increased  over the prior year while our q sales metrics were impacted by the shift noted earlier we expect to fully realize these sales in q our aru and deliveries of company controlled units each grew  yearoveryear in q our net new stores contributed  of yearoveryear growth we had  stores at the end of q up  versus the second quarter of the prior year our reported comp store sales declined  including two percentage points of lift from online and phone sales which grew  over the prior year our trailing  month average comp store sales were  million flat to the prior year this metric continues to be a longerterm opportunity for us to grow average sales per store toward a  million target while delivering  to  incremental four wall profits on the incremental sales our gross margin of  in the second quarter improved  basis points versus the prior year on operating efficiencies and favorable returns experience that more than offset margin pressures from supply chain shipping inefficiencies and close out sales our business initiatives remain on track as seen with our q gross margin improvement for the fullyear we continue to expect to improve our gross margin by  to  basis points on top of the  basis point increase in  our transition costs in q totaled  million or  per diluted share as expected two thirds of these costs landed in cogs and one third fell in operating expenses primarily in sales and marketing expenses we expect transition costs of  million to  million per quarter in the back half of  as previously communicated overall our operating expenses as reported were in line with our expectations but delevered  basis points in the second quarter with a shift of revenues from q to q for modeling purposes ga expenses will be about  million per quarter in q and q our  loss per diluted share includes  from favorable tax benefits from the realization of tax credits and the new stockbased compensation accounting rules as noted earlier our q results were adversely affected by about  on the  million shipped and deliveries that we expect to fully realize in q yeartodate net sales of  million are up  our gross margin improved  basis points reflecting the benefits of our erp enabled efficiencies and our lean initiatives our net operating profit rate improved  basis points in the first half on a  incremental profit flow through rate and a diluted earnings per share of  are up  versus the prior year first half our  million of inventories at quarter end were about  million to  million lighter than planned but have recovered to service demand youll also note a  million yearoveryear increase in our customer prepayments due primarily to the expected shift of deliveries into q and timing changes of orders overall our balance sheet is healthy and our working capital management initiatives are delivering results we generated a record  million in cash from operations yeartodate up  versus the first half of the prior year  million has been used to support high value capital projects and we repurchased  million of our common stock yeartodate our  trailing  months roic through june was up  basis points from this time last year the strength of demand weve seen and continued progress against our initiatives gives us confidence to reaffirm our  eps guidance range of a  to a  throughout my prepared remarks i provided color on our assumptions for growth and shape excluding the impacts from the revenue shift our assumptions for the year are consistent with those provided on our q earnings call with the first phase of our  smart bed launch and our new supplier partners in place we are wellpositioned to deliver on our goals we are advancing our value drivers to deliver  in earnings per share in  this continues to represent a compelling investment opportunity jivey ph at this point we would like to open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from peter keith of piper jaffray your line is now open peter keith hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions and thanks for the detail on the various dynamics of the quarter i was curious with the supplier issue two questions on that was that specific to the  products or is that more broadly across the product line and then secondly would there be any change in the launch timing that you’re expecting for the oncoming  products later this year shelly ibach great hi peter well first of all the inventory issue is resolved and the suppliers meeting our inventory requirements and forecast and demand is strong this was across our entire line for the inventory shortage and then specifically to the question of the  we are really excited about the demand that were seeing from the i and the i both product mix and aru are ahead of expectations and being in this position were confident with the product line up as we are set today as we execute q and we will continue our phased launches over the next three quarters peter keith okay good and maybe i guess the change from q is you probably optimistic around  but you didn’t really have any idea how it perform against now that is out in the marketplace do you feel more confident in that  in earnings or do you feel relatively consistent where you were earlier this year shelly ibach yes this first phase with the i and i we did expect some aru growth and its better than we expected so we’re very pleased with the demand that were seeing and  its early but we see the additional efficiencies throughout our supply chain and will take this time before the next phase  build on that and also capitalize on the increased mix and arus that we’re getting and well see a little more growth in aru in the back half than we had originally thought so it will be both from units and aru and all of this gives us great confidence as we head towards our  peter keith okay sounds good good luck with the rest of the year shelly ibach thank you operator our next question is from brad thomas of keybanc your line is now open brad thomas yes hi good afternoon thank you for taking my questions why don’t you just followup on making sure i’m doing the math right bridging the comparable brand revenue growth if we went to add back the delay in revenue it does imply your comparable brand revenue would have been up about  is that an accurate way of looking at things and can you talk a little bit about what the trends look like in the quarter and as we moved into q thank you david callen yes brad your math is spot on and i will have shelly talk about the trends during the quarter shelly ibach yes brad we’ve seen steady performance all years since january week one regarding traffic and sales so were very pleased with that in q as well brad thomas great and then a question in terms of modeling the back half year will there be any specific costs that you all will incur with respect to the delays that will hit sales here in q and then david if i heard you right did you say ga is going to be  million in each q and q and if thats right why is that the case thank you david callen yes brad the  in terms of the transition costs i highlighted those in my prepared remarks has been  million to  million in each of the quarters at the back half those would capture any supplier related transition costs as onetime items we are very cautious and careful about including only those types of items that are onetime in nature in those buckets when we call those out in terms of the ga color we saw favorability in q and overall for the year i provided that guidance just to help you with your modeling but overall i think its directionally consistent with what we provided before brad thomas got you thank you so much operator our next question is from john baugh of stifel your line is now open john baugh thank you for taking my questions assuming the first one is if i did the math right the incremental flow through in the  million you missed is about  that seems a little higher than what you’ve done in the past or could you just comment on that please david callen yes john its  you’re right the math is about  on that business and you know that incremental sales has that impact we talked about incremental sales on the four wall profits that would be in  to  same thing goes with our model on the incremental sales that we’re talking about in this regard and that weve already spent media dollars marketing dollars to deliver those or get those orders on the books shelly ibach so john on the media we did leverage  basis points in the quarter that you with the shift of the  million if you put that back into the quarter our leverage would have been over  basis points in media john baugh and then youre telling us would have been with the  million too and i realized that the labor days the intensive period but is it fair to say that because it works out weekly roughly that you does  million a week in shipments but i understand that maybe weighted more to labor day but  so we look and alike the first two weeks of july were your sales were  million a week and then another  million spread over those two weeks or are we catching up later or is there some impact to the july business to date from what transpired the john quarter david callen john we expect to be fully caught up and back to normalized lead times by before labor day john baugh okay and then my last question is i don’t think you’ve given us these timing of the  launch and don’t expect you to but is there a change from your internal plan as it relates to labor day or you might have to for something back a talk a little bit or you’re trying to say no everything is on the exact same schedule we had and i guess my concern would just be whether you have to change any of the marketing or promotional stuff around the key labor day event thank you shelly ibach yes john we approach this as a phased launch so that we could benefit from flexibility and as we went into a  our first launch was executed as scheduled we had anticipated looking potentially add a second phase here in the third quarter and instead based on two things one the demand that were seeing from i and the i has been so strong and its been driving the incremental mix in aru that we went to continue to benefit from that and we have a great confidence in where we are with our product lineup as we execute q and we also have efficiency opportunities throughout the vertical business model that we see in this first phase that we want to capitalize on before we launch the next day so we intent to do that and we have confidence on where we are from both a demand and efficiency as we move into the balance of the year john baugh thank you good luck shelly ibach thanks operator our next question is from keith hughes of suntrust your line is now open keith hughes so the  that the sale have been pushed forward is that of the i  and the i  is that why the volumes were up david callen we saw inventory delays across our entire product offering keith hughes across to including the historic ones that were going to be going away income is that correct david callen that’s correct keith hughes so they’re not confused i thought this was given the new construction of the new beds or supplier associated with that is that not the case david callen we’ve  when we identified this supplier we went to them because of their partnership on the innovation side and their willingness to work with us on the profitability goals that we have in conjunction with that whole process we gave them the opportunity to take more of the product line the entire product line keith hughes okay so there we’re going to supplying for the new construction and thats where the shortfalls came or just on their entire offering david callen on the entire offering keith hughes entire offering okay so when  how  in terms of the first two s that are going to roll out i believe you said that earlier is that already started and reach our stores on  its not coming on the web site shelly ibach yes it absolutely should be on the web site to be  smart bed is there and we were set in off source by the end of may and we launched our marketing campaign to support that the second week in june keith hughes and is it called  i was on the impression that you were going to be having all the models with another name plus  at the end does that change shelly ibach it has not changed we’ve intended to in our calling as to the  smart bed sleep number  smart bed and we will through a phased execution changeover our entire product line to the  smart bed david callen however the model name for example the i is still the i the  what was m now the i keith hughes m is the i that is kind of say like i  i thought that was the whole marketing picture shelly ibach yes the sleep number  smart bed yes shelly ibach so it will be the i  smart bed is that correct shelly ibach  smart bed i model keith hughes i model okay all right i was confused sorry about that i guess also at you’re running discounts now on the old beds how long will that last and is that been factored into the  million to  million per quarter transaction costs that you refer to early in the call keith hughes in regards to the transition costs it doesn’t have any discounting included in that number those are purely one  oneoff types of costs that we would be incurring in conjunction with  our supply chain evolution and our network  logistics network evolution shelly ibach okay so with as the shape of gross margin in the second half of the year on a yearoveryear basis what we see more the gain or a better number in the fourth as that transition runs right through david callen you know we’re expecting  to  basis points of gross margin improvement for the fullyear that’s how we’re guiding that’s based on all the puts and takes that we’re seeing across the business keith hughes okay a follow question just on the phase of business i know you’ve had some demand get push forward into the third quarter but if you would have think about that has there been any change over the last several months either up or down in terms of your weekly  weekly pay services shelly ibach yes keith this is where we’ve seen a steady performance on an ongoing basis since january week one consistent with our plans keith hughes okay thank you very much shelly ibach you bet thank you operator our next question is from seth basham of wedbush your line is now open seth basham thanks a lot and good afternoon my first question is on store traffic if you could comment on trends in comp store traffic relative to your expectations it seems that there was a much improvement in comp store traffic even when you add back in the sales that shifted forward shelly ibach yes we’re happy with our demand here in the second quarter as we were in the first quarter the steadiness the consistency of traffic and sales you know we intentionally went into the second quarter holding our marketing or our media spend flat to prior year based on it being a seasonally low quarter and also knowing that we had been experiencing efficiency gains on our initiatives and we again advance those initiatives in the second quarter and pleased especially with the quality traffic that weve been able to generate seth basham got it as you look forward given the strengthened new products that you see would you expect comp store traffic growth to accelerate for the back half of the year david callen you know seth we’re planning for low singledigit comp growth for the year shelly ibach and then from an overall growth in the back half mid to a high singledigit growth david callen yes excluding the shift of the  million seth basham got it as you see more of your sales migrate to the online channel do you think that will potentially lead to more limited ability to sell attachments or are you encouraged by that trend shelly ibach yes we were very encouraged excited about being a directtoconsumer brand at this particular time we’ve been executing against the strategy for a few years now strengthening our competitive advantages of proprietary product exclusive distribution and lifelong relationship with our customers and this is where we will really see it play out especially in the overall retail environment and we have an extraordinary experience in our stores we know that absolutely generates a higher aru overall when our customers get the full experience but the web site actions that were building and taking work in an integrated way with our store experience the two go handinhand and weve always looked at them as a complete customer experience because the customer interacts at different times with the site as well as the store and they’re seamless and they’re meant to fuel and support one another and thats what were seeing in our ability to track the digital actions from the customer and being able to see that pull through to store purchase and in specifically yes the site does have a lower aru than our stores and weve taken that into consideration for our longerterm guidance as well seth basham got it understood my last question is just around upcoming changes in terms of suppliers do you have any other significant changes such as the one that you called out that causes transition issue recently shelly ibach no we don’t that we made significant changes in the second quarter with the first phase and were set in executing against this plan as we head into the back half seth basham got it okay if you have that degree of confidence and i guess also a question i have is with your guidance for the year you still are relatively wide range of eps guided for the year what are the considerations that keep the guidance range wide at this point in time david callen you know seth we raised our guidance on the last call and we feel confident with the elements that weve got in front of us and the things that we put in place the initiatives that we have made progress against we feel like the  to  is a good solid range across to deliver against seth basham got it all right thank you very much david callen you bet shelly ibach thank you seth operator our next question is from budd bugatch of raymond james financial your line is now open budd bugatch thank you very much good evening everyone and thank you for taking my questions shelly ibach hey budd budd bugatch yes hi shelly if i did my math right it looks like  or so beds were delayed is that correct and is the aru of what the  million the same as the aru of the average  or so david callen that’s directionally fine budd budd bugatch i’m hoping it’s not more directionally david is it  i mean is it  i think the direction we will get there i’m just trying to understand its about  beds per store that you kind of disappointed customers and have you lost any of those sales or what you have to do to keep those sales david callen budd there is a little bit higher aru as shelly highlighted and we’ve had active outreach working with customers that have been affected by the inventory delays that included some appeasements etcetera but those have already been baked into both our q results and our thinking for the balance of the year budd bugatch okay and can you talk  can you give us a little bit more detail on what happened with supplier how can that  how did it become a surprise and during the quarter did they get to be a surprise david callen you know budd we transitioned more than  suppliers and we had one that had some productivity challenges and we continue to work with them during the quarter to get productivity where needed to be and since done that we are really glad to see how much this vendor has been a strong business partner and has been leaning in with the business and they are producing now at a level that’s more than we need for demand for the balance of the year budd bugatch so i’m curious as to why the big change in supplier base i guess i mustve missed that because i don’t think you were dissatisfied with  suppliers david callen you know that’s  its part of our overall plan that we talked about at the november investor day that we would be looking for suppliers that are working with us both on the innovation side and those in support of our profitability objectives shelly ibach and budd it was a combination the  bed is a very different product than our current one and it did require additional suppliers so it  and we cast the broader net on supplier changes to keep pace with the margin expansion goals that we have over the next number of years as well as the innovation budd bugatch so maybe i dont have any problem with that its when you told us it was a wider array of issues affecting a wider number of beds that was the legacy beds as well that’s kind of what you just said doesn’t kind of make intuitive sense to me maybe im just too dense to get it but  maybe it affects other beds those are things that we’re operating well and you had already had enough i mean we had enough issues with erp that we didn’t need to replete any of those what am i missing in that equation david callen yes budd all of the products were new to the center and taking on the sleep number bed line as well as the  smart bed line they had some productivity challenges and you know glad to say that was contained to one weeks with the deliveries at the end of the quarter and that its fully  the inventory challenges that we had are fully resolved and were moving forward budd bugatch so are you saying it occurred toward the end of the quarter or did it  i thought it was  i thought just the  million it equates to one week i didn’t  i thought it happened multiple speakers david callen yes all i’m saying to you that at the end of the quarter we had an additional weeks worth of deliveries that didnt get shipped out compared to what we expected budd bugatch okay and forgive my memory i’m an aging guy and my memory is a little faulty when i thought all of the s were supposed to be done this year i thought it was towards a phased launch but it was all this year am i not mistaken on that its now that  its going to looks like the first quarter of  david callen last quarter we talked about it would be in a  to  months effort which would have taken as to early part of  budd bugatch so is it still the early part of  announced through the full  first full quarter of  david callen well that’s  i’m implying the same yes three quarters the next  over the next three quarters budd bugatch over the next three quarters okay and you  david happened with tax i know the lost was small but the tax rate therefore becomes a big item you probably had some discrete items in there that affected tax what’s the tax guidance for the fullyear david callen so for the balance of the year i think it’s the part that matters its  is what you should be using in your modeling what happened in q is we had some tax credits related to the acquisition of the bam labs that we were able to realize that was about  and then we had a penny related to the new accounting rules for equity compensation budd bugatch and that was a positive or a negative david callen those are both favorable budd bugatch favorable and so if we were at a  for the balance of the year that gets to about a  in change for the fullyear is that in the right ballpark as you would say directionally correct david callen yes that’s directionally correct budd bugatch okay all right thank you thank you very much for indiscernible with all this old guy shelly ibach okay thank you budd david callen anytime budd operator operator instructions our next question on queue is from michael lasser of ubs your line is now open michael lasser good evening thanks all for taking my question on the delayed  million did that only impact the retail samestore sales because your retail comp went from up two last quarter to down six this quarter where as your online and phone comp went from  both went from  to up  david callen hey michael yes the reported comp for the quarter was down  and adjusting for that  million yes it would have largely all been comp growth on an adjusted basis it would have been a plus  michael lasser but i guess my question was that only affected the retail comp and not the online channel david callen yes for the most our comp store growth number includes both michael lasser okay and as you look towards the third quarter the  that were impacted by the inventory shortage are you going to get all of that back in the third quarter david callen yes michael lasser in that still how you’re going to be able to offset that you referred to earlier shelly ibach how are we going to offset the appeasements michael lasser yes shelly ibach we did in the second quarter and we will in the third quarter and back half due to our margin expansion initiative and the pace that they’re on michael lasser got it and then my last question is it looks like the i is currently  off on the web site the i is  off on the web site was it part of your plan to discount those products still early in their year shelly ibach yes we utilize dollars off in the close of the sale so its not in a track for us we utilized benefits for the attract but the dollars off or financing helps us with close michael lasser okay even though the ile bed is not in discounting shelly ibach right well the ile is in  generally in market during a large market share event michael lasser okay and shelly i think you didn’t necessarily comment on traffic earlier in response to a question you said it was steady … shelly ibach yes michael lasser … but you also mentioned that conversion rate was up so it would suggest that traffic is down is that right shelly ibach yes when we look at traffic and one of our key measurements is the qualified unique visitors yes again it exceeded our expectations and weve been focused on quality traffic with our digital actions and yes that is driving a higher conversion but it was not down michael lasser it was not down okay thank you very much shelly ibach thank you operator we show no further questions on queue at this time now let me turn the call over back to the select comfort dave schwantes thank you for joining us today we look forward to discussing our third quarter
