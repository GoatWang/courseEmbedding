outside environments businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization key factors examined by pestel analysis political – what opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business economic – what economic policies trends and structures are expected to affect the
