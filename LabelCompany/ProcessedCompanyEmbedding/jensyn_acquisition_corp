proceeds raised in the offering described below  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination we do not anticipate any change in the categories of our intended use of proceeds our insiders and chardan capital markets llc andor their respective designees have committed that they will purchase the private units for an aggregate purchase price of  from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering our insiders and chardan capital markets llc have also agreed that if the overallotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part they andor their designees will purchase from us at a price of  per unit the number of private units up to a maximum of  private units that is necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to  per share of common stock sold to the public in this offering all of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below  or  if the overallotment option is exercised in full of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be placed in a trust account in the united states at jp morgan chase bank na maintained by continental stock transfer  trust company as trustee the funds held in the trust account will be invested only in united states government treasury bills bonds or notes having a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under rule a promulgated under the investment company act of  and that invest solely in us treasuries so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption of  of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period the proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used to pay converting stockholders any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business the payment to jensyn integration services llc a company owned by our insiders of a monthly fee of  is for general and administrative services including office space utilities and secretarial support however pursuant to the terms of such agreement we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business combination any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business combination this arrangement is being agreed to by jensyn integration services llc for our benefit we believe that the fee charged by jensyn integration services llc is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person this arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders other than the  per month fee no compensation of any kind including finder’s fees consulting fees or other similar compensation will be paid to our insiders members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination regardless of the type of transaction that it is however such individuals will receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations since the role of present management after our initial business combination is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after our initial business combination regardless of whether the overallotment option is exercised in full the net proceeds from this offering and insider loans available to us out of trust for our working capital requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be approximately  the allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available to us represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds in the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories if our estimate of the costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so or the amount of interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the current low interest rate environment we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our insiders members of our management team or third parties but our insiders members of our management team or third parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering including the funds held in the trust account in connection with our initial business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto including the deferred underwriting commission payable to chardan capital markets llc in an amount equal to  of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of our initial business combination to the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will along with any other net proceeds not expended be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations for strategic acquisitions and for marketing research and development of existing or new products to the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination we will pay the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account if such funds are insufficient our insiders have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation currently anticipated to be no more than  and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses as of december   our insiders and a related party had loaned or advanced to us an aggregate of  to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the sec registration fee finra filing fee the nonrefundable portion of the nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses the loans are payable without interest no later than the date on which our initial business combination is consummated we believe that upon consummation of this offering we will have sufficient available funds which includes amounts that may be released to us from the trust account to operate for up to the next  months assuming that our initial business combination is not consummated during that time however if necessary in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering our insiders officers and directors andor their designees may but are not obligated to loan us funds from time to time or at any time in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note the notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination without interest or at the lender’s discretion up to  of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of  per unit which for example would result in the holders being issued  shares of common stock if  of notes were so converted since the  rights included in the private units would result in the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the closing of our business combination as well as  warrants to purchase  shares our stockholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination if we do not complete a business combination the  of loans and advances from our insiders and a related party and any other outstanding loans from our insiders officers and directors or their affiliates will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust account if any a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of  our redemption of  of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period  if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a stockholder vote or  if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with utilizing the net proceeds of this offering our ability to compete in completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources the following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses • our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction • our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination • our outstanding rights warrants and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent • our obligation to ensure that if we enter into a definitive agreement for a business combination in which we will not be the surviving entity the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an asconverted into common stock basis for instance if the business combination would result in each share of common stock outstanding being exchanged for two shares of common stock each right would result in the holder receiving twotenths  of a share of common stock upon consummation of such business combination • our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to chardan capital markets llc upon consummation of our initial business combination • our obligation to either repay or issue private units upon conversion of up to  of working capital loans that may be made to us by our insiders officers directors or their affiliates • our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares as well as the private units and underlying securities and any shares issued to our insiders officers directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans and • the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an initial business combination with a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms if we succeed in effecting our initial business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business subsequent to our initial business combination we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively company description we are a blank check company formed under the laws of the state of delaware on october   we were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger share exchange asset acquisition stock purchase recapitalization reorganization or other similar business combination which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to throughout this prospectus as a target business to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to this offering our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region although we intend to focus our search on target businesses operating in the information technology consulting industry we have not selected any target business for our initial business combination and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf directly or indirectly engaged in any substantive discussions with a target business with respect to a business combination transaction with us our executive officers and directors have extensive experience in the information technology consulting industry and the staffing industry as managers principals advisors or directors of companies operating in the information technology consulting industry they also have extensive experience in identifying negotiating with and conducting due diligence on companies targeted for acquisition and consummating acquisitions in the information technology consulting industry and the staffing industry prior to the consummation of our initial business combination we intend to leverage the industry experience of our executive officers including their extensive contacts relationships and access to acquisition opportunities by focusing our efforts on identifying a prospective target business or businesses operating in the information technology consulting industry although we will not be limited to the information technology consulting industry and may consider opportunities in the staffing industry and other industries our management team however does not have prior experience in pursuing acquisitions on behalf of blank check companies and past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to locating a target business to acquire or any business combination we may consummate we may also seek guidance and advice from special advisors to us peter underwood joseph raymond and demetrios mallios we have no formal arrangement or agreement with these advisors to provide services to us and they have no obligation fiduciary or otherwise to present business opportunities to us these special advisors will provide advice introductions to potential targets and assistance to us at our request only if they are able to do so nevertheless we believe that with their respective business backgrounds and extensive contacts these special advisors will be helpful to our search for a target business and our consummation of a business combination subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination we believe that the strengths of our management team particularly their extensive operations experience in the information technology consulting industry will be valuable to any business in the information technology consulting industry with which we consummate our initial business combination although the specific roles if any they may have following our initial business combination cannot be determined at this time we will have until  months from the closing of this offering to consummate our initial business combination however if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within  months we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times each by an additional three months for a total of up to  months to complete a business combination our ability to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination will be conditioned upon the deposit by our initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees into the trust account of  prior to the applicable deadline for each three month extension our initial stockholders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period we will as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem  of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes and then seek to dissolve and liquidate however we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders in the event of our dissolution and liquidation the public warrants and public rights will expire and will be worthless we will either  seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account net of taxes payable or  provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account net of taxes payable in each case subject to the limitations described herein the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the securities and exchange commission or sec in that case we will file tender offer documents with the sec which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the sec’s proxy rules the initial per public share redemption or conversion price will be  per share regardless of whether the overallotment option is exercised however we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders notwithstanding the foregoing an increase in the size of the offering pursuant to rule b under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act could result in the pershare conversion or liquidation price decreasing by as much as  alternatively our insiders or their designees may purchase from us at a price of  per unit the number of private units that is necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to  per share sold to the public in this offering pursuant to the rules of the nasdaq stock market our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value of at least  of the value of the trust account excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination if our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria we will also obtain a fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm before consummating a business combination with an entity affiliated with any of our officers directors or insiders we anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the posttransaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire  of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses we may however structure our initial business combination such that the posttransaction company owns or acquires less than  of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons but we will only complete such business combination if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns or acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act even if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the voting securities of the target our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the posttransaction company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  controlling interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination if less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the posttransaction company the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the  of net assets test if our business combination is structured in a manner in which we are not the surviving entity and the target company securities are to be issued to holders of our securities the target company will be required to register the target company securities pursuant to a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission unless an exemption from registration can be identified the registration process if required could delay the consummation of the business combination if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has preexisting fiduciary or contractual obligations he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us all of our officers directors and director nominees currently have certain relevant preexisting fiduciary duties or contractual obligations  our executive offices are located at  west main street freehold new jersey  and our telephone number
