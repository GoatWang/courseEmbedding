peoples in venezuela like many ancient societies already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps which ooze through the ground to the surface in the years before the spanish conquistadors the thick black liquid known to the locals as mene was primarily used for medical purposes as an illumination source and for the caulking of canoes spanish acquisitionedit upon arrival in the early th century the spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well and for treating their weapons the first documented shipment of petroleum from venezuela was in  when a single barrel of oil was sent to spain to alleviate the gout of emperor charles v –edit juan vicente gómez ancient office of mene grande oil company despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in venezuela for centuries the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early s in  juan vicente gómez replaced his ailing predecessor cipriano castro as the president of venezuela over the next few years gómez granted several concessions to explore produce and refine oil most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them one such concession was granted to rafael max valladares who hired caribbean petroleum company later acquired by royal dutch shell to carry out his oil exploration project on  april  upon the completion of the zumaquei now called mgi oil well the first venezuelan oilfield of importance mene grande was discovered by caribbean petroleum in the maracaibo basin this major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to invade venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action from  to  several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic bolivar coastal field however world war i slowed significant development of the industry due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war by the end of  the first refining operations began at the san lorenzo refinery to process the mene grande field production and the first significant exports of venezuelan oil by caribbean petroleum left from the san lorenzo terminal by the end of  petroleum appeared for the first time on the venezuelan export statistics at  metric tons it was the blowout of the barroso no  well in cabimas in  that marked the beginning of venezuelas modern history as a major producer this discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich and by  venezuela became the worlds leading oil exporter oil ended venezuelas relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers making it a linchpin of an everexpanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking venezuelas oil production became a major factor in policy making in washington before the second world war cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nations largest oil fields which are located around and beneath lake maracaibo other fields are increasing in importance mainly in eastern venezuela about twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and after the united states the second largest oil producer exports of oil boomed from  to  between  and  by the end of the s venezuela had become the thirdleading oil producer in the world behind the united states and the soviet union as well as the leading exporter first dutch diseaseedit by  the dramatic development of the venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country however agricultural production began to decrease dramatically this sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the dutch disease this disease occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors agriculture accounted for about onethird of economic production in the s but by the s this fraction dramatically reduced to onetenth this sudden increase of oil production restricted venezuelas overall ability to create and maintain other industries the government had ignored serious social problems including education health infrastructure agriculture and domestic industries causing venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countriescitation needed xenophobiaedit with a large influx of foreign invaders the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent novelist jose rafael pocaterra described the oilmen as the new spaniards he wrote in  one day some spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs a grotesque stork with crystal eyes they drew something on a piece of paper and opened their way through the forest other new spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways rufino blanco fombona a venezuelan writer and politician accounts for the conflict between venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his  novel la bella y la fiera the workers asked for a miserable salary increase and those blond blueeyed men who own millions of dollars pounds and gulden in european and us banks refused –edit this

the opec member countries was to work together in order to secure and stabilize international oil prices to ensure their interests as oil producing nations this was managed largely via maintaining export quotas that helped prevent the overproduction of oil on an international scale oil embargo of edit main article  oil crisis in the early s oil producing countries of the persian gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation in  they rapidly obtained a  percent participation and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to  percent participation in the ownership of the companies by  opec persian gulf states members decided to raise their prices by  percent and to place an embargo on countries friendly to

quadrupled with a new sense of confidence venezuelan president carlos andrés pérez pledged that venezuela would develop significantly within a few years by substituting imports subsidies and protective tariffs he planned to use oil profits to increase employment fight poverty increase income and diversify the economy however opec members had been violating production quotas and oil prices fell drastically again in the s pushing venezuela deeper into debt nationalizationedit petroleum map of venezuela  well before  venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry in august  under the presidency of rafael caldera a law was passed that nationalized the countrys natural gas industry also in  the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets plant and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession the movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree  decree  stipulated that all exploration production refining and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the ministry of mines and hydrocarbons nationalization become official when the presidency of carlos andrés pérez whose economic plan la gran venezuela called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution the country officially nationalized its oil industry on  january  at the site of zumaque oilwell  mene grande and along with it came the birth of petróleos de venezuela sa pdvsa which is the venezuelan stateowned petroleum company all foreign oil companies that once did business in venezuela were replaced by venezuelan companies each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new national oil company which maintained the structures and functions of its multinational corporation mncpredecessor all the new companies are owned by a holding companypetroven or pdv and in its turned owned by the state ultimately not much had changed in this regard as all venezuelans with leading positions in the mncs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies and therefore still securing their interests in venezuelas oil pdvsa controls activity involving oil and natural gas in venezuela in  in an aggressive internationalization plan pdvsa bought refineries in usa and europe as the american citgo that catapultated it to the thirdlargest oil company in the world –edit after the  oil crisis the brief period of economic prosperity for venezuela was relatively short lived as venezuelan oil minister and opec cofounder juan pablo pérez alfonzo had presciently warned in  ten years from now twenty years from now you will see oil will bring us ruin it is the devils excrement this was the case during the s oil glut opec member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas and once again oil prices plummetedcitation needed second dutch diseaseedit during the mids venezuelas oil production steadily began to rise by the s symptoms of the dutch disease were once again becoming apparent between  venezuelas industrial production declined from  percent to  percent of the countrys gross domestic product compared to a decrease of  percent to  percent for the rest of latin america but production levels continued to rise until  however the efficiency of pdvsa was brought into question over these years during – the amount of pdvsa’s income that went towards the companys costs was on average  percent leaving a remainder of  percent for the government from  to  however that distribution almost completely reversed to where  percent of pdvsas income were kept by pdvsa leaving a remainder of only  percent for the government –presentedit former venezuelan president hugo chávez there is no question that venezuela under chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of dutch disease in the world foreign policy after hugo chávez officially took office in february  several policy changes involving the countrys oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his bolivarian revolution since then pdvsa has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the orinoco petroleum belt formerly operated by international oil companies exxonmobil conocophillips chevron and total chávez’s policies damaged venezuelas oil industry due to lack of investment corruption and cash shortages the chávez government used pdvsa resources to fund social programmes treating it like a piggybank and pdvsa staff were required to support chávez his social policies resulted in overspending that caused shortages in venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world according to corrales and penfold chávez was not the first president in venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency chávezs successor nicolás maduro continued much of the policies created by chávez with venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies reinforcement of opecedit at the time of chávezs election opec had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created a combination of opec members including venezuela regularly ignoring quotas and nonopec countries such as mexico and russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the venezuelan economy one of chávezs main goals as president was to combat this problem by restrengthening opec and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world and in  he hosted the first summit of the headsofstate of opec in  years the second ever goals of this meeting held in caracas included recuperating the credibility of venezuela in opec defending oil prices consolidating relations between venezuela and the arabislamic world and to strengthen opec in generalcitation needed the meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years but much of that is also a consequence of the  september  attacks against the united states the iraq war and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like china and india which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by opec during the preceding period in addition to these events the december  oil strike in venezuela which resulted in a loss of almost mmbpd of crude oil production brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude enabling act laws and controversyedit this section needs additional citations for verification

supporting chávez on the pdvsa towers in maracaibo in  the prochávez national assembly granted chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions on  november  while ruling by

outraged at the changes for the opposition to chávez such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that chávez was a dictatorintraining chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas such as ten percent of pdvsa’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs he also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process chavez initiated many of these major changes

overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support in december  pdvsa officially went on strike creating a nearcomplete halt on oil production in venezuela the aim of the venezuelan general strike of  was to pressure chávez into resigning and calling early elections the strike lasted approximately two months and the government ended up firing  pdvsa employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the chávez government by january  protests involving hundreds of thousands of venezuelans opposing chávez became common in venezuela in april  mass demonstrations occurred in caracas and chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the  venezuelan coup détat attempt a few months after the failure of the coup and the return of chavez a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an indefinite national strike which in many places turned out to be a forced bosses lock out where the employees were prevented from workingcitation needed when the strike ended substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by  percent this increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over  percent in march  following the strikes chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as renationalization he aimed at improving the efficiency of pdvsa in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to

stated that he would like to sell more venezuelan oil to china so his country can become more independent of the united states the united states currently accounts for  percent of venezuelas exports in  chávez struck a deal with brazilian oil company petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern brazil where crude oil will be sent from both brazil and argentina a similar deal was struck with ecuador where venezuela agreed to refine  barrels  m of crude oil from ecuador at discount prices cuba agreed to let thousands of venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs and in turn venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to cuba at a  discount under petrocaribe programcitation needed third dutch diseaseedit shortages leave shelves empty in this venezuelan store the chávez administration used high oil prices in the s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters the social works initiated by chávezs government relied on oil products the

revenue grew from  of total income in  to   oil exports increased from  in   to  in  and his administrations dependence on petroleum sales was one of the chief problems facing the chávez government by  exports of everything but oil collapsed and in  the world bank explained that venezuelas economy is extremely vulnerable to changes in oil prices since in   of the countrys exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue relied on oil production economists say that the venezuelan governments overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the countrys economy contributing to rising inflation poverty low healthcare spending and shortages in venezuela going into the final years of his presidency according to analysts the economic woes venezuela

prediscoveryedit indigenous usageedit the indigenous peoples in venezuela like many ancient societies already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps which ooze through the ground to the surface in the years before the spanish conquistadors the thick black liquid known to the locals as mene was primarily used for medical purposes as an illumination source and for the caulking of canoes spanish acquisitionedit upon arrival in the early th century the spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well and for treating their weapons the first documented shipment of petroleum from venezuela was in  when a single barrel of oil was sent to spain to alleviate the gout of emperor charles v –edit juan vicente gómez ancient office of mene grande oil company despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in venezuela for centuries the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early s in  juan vicente gómez replaced his ailing predecessor cipriano castro as the president of venezuela over the next few years gómez granted several concessions to explore produce and refine oil most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them one such concession was granted to rafael max valladares who hired caribbean petroleum company later acquired by royal dutch shell to carry out his oil exploration project on  april  upon the completion of the zumaquei now called mgi oil well the first venezuelan oilfield of importance mene grande was discovered by caribbean petroleum in the maracaibo basin this major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to invade venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action from  to  several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic bolivar coastal field however world war i slowed significant development of the industry due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war by the end of  the first refining operations began at the san lorenzo refinery to process the mene grande field production and the first significant exports of venezuelan oil by caribbean petroleum left from the san lorenzo terminal by the end of  petroleum appeared for the first time on the venezuelan export statistics at  metric tons it was the blowout of the barroso no  well in cabimas in  that marked the beginning of venezuelas modern history as a major producer this discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich and by  venezuela became the worlds leading oil exporter oil ended venezuelas relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers making it a linchpin of an everexpanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking venezuelas oil production became a major factor in policy making in washington before the second world war cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nations largest oil fields which are located around and beneath lake maracaibo other fields are increasing in importance mainly in eastern venezuela about twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and after the united states the second largest oil producer exports of oil boomed from  to  between  and  by the end of the s venezuela had become the thirdleading oil producer in the world behind the united states and the soviet union as well as the leading exporter first dutch diseaseedit by  the dramatic development of the venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country however agricultural production began to decrease dramatically this sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the dutch disease this disease occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors agriculture accounted for about onethird of economic production in the s but by the s this fraction dramatically reduced to onetenth this sudden increase of oil production restricted venezuelas overall ability to create and maintain other industries the government had ignored serious social problems including education health infrastructure agriculture and domestic industries causing venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countriescitation needed xenophobiaedit with a large influx of foreign invaders the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent novelist jose rafael pocaterra described the oilmen as the new spaniards he wrote in  one day some spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs a grotesque stork with crystal eyes they drew something on a piece of paper and opened their way through the forest other new spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways rufino blanco fombona a venezuelan writer and politician accounts

crisis in the early s oil producing countries of the persian gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation in  they rapidly obtained a  percent participation and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to  percent participation in the ownership of the companies by  opec persian gulf states members decided to raise

in the middle east and the oil producing countries of the persian gulf no longer exporting to the united states and oil prices rising steeply venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits between  and  the venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled with a new sense of confidence venezuelan president carlos andrés pérez pledged that venezuela would develop significantly within a few years by substituting imports subsidies and protective tariffs he planned to use oil profits to increase employment fight poverty increase income and diversify the economy however opec members had been violating production quotas and oil prices fell drastically again in the s pushing venezuela deeper into debt nationalizationedit petroleum map of venezuela  well before  venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry in august  under the presidency of rafael caldera a law was passed that nationalized the countrys natural gas industry also in  the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets plant and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession the movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree  decree  stipulated that all exploration production refining and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the ministry of mines and hydrocarbons nationalization become official when the presidency of carlos andrés pérez whose economic plan la gran venezuela called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution the country officially nationalized its oil industry on  january  at the site of zumaque oilwell  mene grande and along with it came the birth of petróleos de venezuela sa pdvsa which is the venezuelan stateowned petroleum company all foreign oil companies that once did business in venezuela were replaced by venezuelan companies each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new national oil company which maintained the structures and functions of its multinational corporation mncpredecessor all the new companies are owned by a holding companypetroven or pdv and in its turned owned by the state ultimately not much had changed in this regard as all venezuelans with leading positions in the mncs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies and therefore still securing their interests in venezuelas oil pdvsa controls activity involving oil and natural gas in venezuela in  in an aggressive internationalization plan pdvsa bought refineries in usa and europe as the american citgo that catapultated it to the thirdlargest oil company in the world –edit after the  oil crisis the brief period of economic prosperity for venezuela was relatively short lived as venezuelan oil minister and opec cofounder juan pablo pérez alfonzo had presciently warned in  ten years from now twenty years from now you will see oil will bring us ruin it is the devils excrement this was the case during the s oil glut opec member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas and once again oil prices plummetedcitation needed second dutch diseaseedit during the mids venezuelas oil production steadily began to rise by the s symptoms of the dutch disease were once again becoming apparent between  venezuelas industrial production declined from  percent to  percent of the countrys gross domestic product compared to a decrease of  percent to  percent for the rest of latin america but production levels continued to rise until  however the efficiency of pdvsa was brought into question over these years during – the amount of pdvsa’s income that went towards the companys costs was on average  percent leaving a remainder of  percent for the government from  to  however that distribution almost completely reversed to where  percent of pdvsas income were kept by pdvsa leaving a remainder of only  percent for the government –presentedit former venezuelan president hugo chávez there is no question that venezuela under chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of dutch disease in the world foreign policy after hugo chávez officially took office in february  several policy changes involving the countrys oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his bolivarian revolution since then pdvsa has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the orinoco petroleum belt formerly operated by international oil companies exxonmobil conocophillips chevron and total chávez’s policies damaged venezuelas oil industry due to lack of investment corruption and cash shortages the chávez government used pdvsa resources to fund social programmes treating it like a piggybank and pdvsa staff were required to support chávez his social policies resulted in overspending that caused shortages in venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world according to corrales and penfold chávez was not the first president in venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency chávezs successor nicolás maduro continued much of the policies created by chávez with venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies reinforcement of opecedit at the time of chávezs election opec had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created a combination of opec members including venezuela regularly ignoring quotas and nonopec countries such as mexico and russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the venezuelan economy one of chávezs main goals as president was to combat this problem by restrengthening opec and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world and in  he hosted the first summit of the headsofstate of opec in  years the second ever goals of this meeting held in caracas included recuperating the credibility of venezuela in opec defending oil prices consolidating relations between venezuela and the arabislamic world and to strengthen opec in generalcitation needed the meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years but much of that is also a consequence of the  september  attacks against the united states the iraq war and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like china and india which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by opec during the preceding period in addition to these events the december  oil strike in venezuela which resulted in a loss of almost mmbpd of crude oil production brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude enabling act

to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions on  november  while ruling by decree chávez enacted the new hydrocarbons law which came into effect in january  the laws marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president with both chavistas and antichavistas outraged at the changes for the opposition to chávez such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that chávez was a dictatorintraining chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas such as ten percent of pdvsa’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs he also changed tax policies and the

months and the government ended up firing  pdvsa employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the chávez government by january  protests involving hundreds of thousands of venezuelans opposing chávez became common in venezuela in april  mass demonstrations occurred in caracas and chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the  venezuelan coup détat attempt a few months after

will be sent from both brazil and argentina a similar deal was struck with ecuador where venezuela agreed to refine  barrels  m of crude oil from ecuador at discount prices cuba agreed to let thousands of venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs and in turn venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to cuba at a  discount under petrocaribe

already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps which ooze through the ground to the surface in the years before the spanish conquistadors the thick black liquid known to the locals as mene was primarily used for medical purposes as an illumination source and for the caulking of canoes spanish acquisitionedit upon arrival in the early th century the spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well and for treating their weapons the first documented shipment of petroleum from venezuela was in  when a single barrel of oil was sent to spain to alleviate the gout of emperor charles v –edit juan vicente gómez ancient office of mene grande oil company despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in venezuela for centuries the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early s in  juan vicente gómez replaced his ailing predecessor cipriano castro as the president of venezuela over the next few years gómez granted several concessions to explore produce and refine oil most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them one such concession was granted to rafael max valladares who hired caribbean petroleum company later acquired by royal dutch shell to carry out his oil exploration project on  april  upon the completion of the zumaquei now called mgi oil well the first venezuelan oilfield of importance mene grande was discovered by caribbean petroleum in the maracaibo basin this major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to invade venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action from  to  several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic bolivar coastal field however world war i slowed significant development of the industry due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war by the end of  the first refining operations began at the san lorenzo refinery to process the mene grande field production and the first significant exports of venezuelan oil by caribbean petroleum left from the san lorenzo terminal by the end of  petroleum appeared for the first time on the venezuelan export statistics at  metric tons it was the blowout of the barroso no  well in cabimas in  that marked the beginning of venezuelas modern history as a major producer this discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich and by  venezuela became the worlds leading oil exporter oil ended venezuelas relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers making it a linchpin of an everexpanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking venezuelas oil production became a major factor in policy making in washington before the second world war cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nations largest oil fields which are located around and beneath lake maracaibo other fields are increasing in importance mainly in eastern venezuela about twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and after the united states the second largest oil producer exports of oil boomed from  to  between  and  by the end of the s venezuela had become the thirdleading oil producer in the world behind the united states and the soviet union as well as the leading exporter first dutch diseaseedit by  the dramatic development of the venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country however agricultural production began to decrease dramatically this sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the dutch disease this disease occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors agriculture accounted for about onethird of economic production in the s but by the s this fraction dramatically reduced to onetenth this sudden increase of oil production restricted venezuelas overall ability to create and maintain other industries the government had ignored serious social problems including education health infrastructure agriculture and domestic industries causing venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countriescitation needed xenophobiaedit with a large influx of foreign invaders the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent novelist jose rafael pocaterra described the oilmen as the new spaniards he wrote in  one day some spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs a grotesque stork with crystal eyes they drew something on a piece of paper and opened their way through the forest other new spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways rufino blanco fombona a venezuelan writer and politician accounts for the conflict between venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his  novel la bella y la fiera the workers asked

the overproduction of oil on an international scale oil embargo of edit main article  oil crisis in the early s oil producing countries of the persian gulf began negotiations with oil companies in attempt to increase their ownership participation in  they rapidly obtained a  percent participation and less than a year later they revised those agreements to obtain up to  percent participation in the ownership of the companies by  opec persian gulf states members decided to raise their prices by  percent and to place an embargo on countries friendly to israel the united states and the

states and oil prices rising steeply venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits between  and  the venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled with a new sense of

profits to increase employment fight poverty increase income and diversify the economy however opec members had been violating production quotas and oil prices fell drastically again in the s pushing venezuela deeper into debt nationalizationedit petroleum map of venezuela  well before  venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry in august  under the presidency of rafael caldera a law was passed that nationalized the countrys natural gas industry also in  the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets plant and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession the movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree  decree  stipulated that all exploration production refining and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the ministry of mines and hydrocarbons nationalization become official when the presidency of carlos andrés pérez whose economic plan la gran venezuela called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution the country officially nationalized its oil industry on  january  at the site of zumaque oilwell  mene grande and along with it came the birth of petróleos de venezuela sa pdvsa which is the venezuelan stateowned petroleum company all foreign oil companies that once did business in venezuela were replaced by venezuelan companies each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new national oil company which maintained the structures and functions of its multinational corporation mncpredecessor all the new companies are owned by a holding companypetroven or pdv and in its turned owned by the state ultimately not much had changed in this regard as all venezuelans with leading positions in the mncs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies and therefore still securing their interests in venezuelas oil pdvsa controls activity involving oil and natural gas in venezuela in  in an aggressive internationalization plan pdvsa bought refineries in usa and europe as the american citgo that catapultated it to the thirdlargest oil company in the world –edit after the  oil crisis the brief period of economic prosperity for venezuela was relatively short lived as venezuelan oil minister and opec cofounder juan pablo pérez alfonzo had presciently warned in  ten years from now twenty years from

between  venezuelas industrial production declined from  percent to  percent of the countrys gross domestic product compared to a decrease of  percent to  percent for the rest of latin america but production levels continued to rise until  however the efficiency of pdvsa was brought into question over these years during – the amount of pdvsa’s income that went towards the companys costs was on average  percent leaving a remainder of  percent for the government from  to  however that distribution almost completely reversed to where  percent of pdvsas income were kept by pdvsa leaving a remainder of only  percent for the government –presentedit former venezuelan president hugo chávez there is no question that venezuela under chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of dutch disease in the world foreign policy after hugo chávez officially took office in february  several policy changes involving the countrys oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his bolivarian revolution since then pdvsa has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the orinoco petroleum belt formerly operated by international oil companies exxonmobil conocophillips chevron and total chávez’s policies damaged venezuelas oil industry due to lack of investment corruption and cash shortages the chávez government used pdvsa resources to fund social programmes treating it like a piggybank and pdvsa staff were required to support chávez his social policies resulted in overspending that caused shortages in venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world according to corrales and penfold chávez was not the first president in venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency chávezs successor nicolás maduro continued much of the policies created by chávez with venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies reinforcement of opecedit at the time of chávezs election opec had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created a combination of opec members including venezuela regularly ignoring quotas and nonopec countries such as mexico and russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the venezuelan economy one of chávezs main goals as president was to combat this problem by restrengthening opec and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world and in  he hosted the first summit of the headsofstate of opec in  years the second ever goals of this meeting held in caracas included recuperating the credibility of venezuela in opec defending oil prices consolidating relations between venezuela and the arabislamic world and to strengthen opec in generalcitation needed the meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years but much of that is also a consequence of the  september  attacks against the united states the iraq war and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like china and india which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by opec during the preceding period in addition to these events the december  oil strike in venezuela which resulted in a loss of almost mmbpd of crude oil production brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude enabling act laws and controversyedit this section needs additional citations for verification

supporting chávez on the pdvsa towers in maracaibo in  the prochávez national assembly granted chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions on  november  while ruling by decree chávez enacted the new hydrocarbons law which came into effect in january  the laws marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president with both chavistas and antichavistas outraged at the changes for the opposition to chávez such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that chávez was a dictatorintraining chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas such as ten percent of pdvsa’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs he also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over pdvsa and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over pdvsa’s small revenue contributions to the government by  warnings grew of the chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support in december  pdvsa officially went on strike creating a nearcomplete halt on oil production in venezuela the aim of the venezuelan general strike of  was to pressure chávez into resigning and calling early elections the strike lasted approximately two months and the government ended up firing  pdvsa employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the chávez government by january  protests involving hundreds of thousands of venezuelans opposing chávez became common in venezuela in april  mass demonstrations occurred in caracas and chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the  venezuelan coup détat attempt a few months after the failure of the coup and the return of chavez a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an indefinite national strike which in many places turned out to be a forced bosses lock out where the employees were prevented from workingcitation needed when the strike ended substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by  percent this increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over  percent in march  following the strikes chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as renationalization he aimed at improving the efficiency of pdvsa in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in chávezs first term by  the government had a  percent share which was announced to be increased by  percentcitation needed international dealsedit in  pdvsa opened its first office in china and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more venezuelan oil to china so his country can become more independent of the united states the united states currently accounts for  percent of venezuelas exports in  chávez struck a deal with brazilian oil company petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern brazil where crude oil will be sent from both brazil and argentina a similar deal was struck with ecuador where venezuela agreed to refine  barrels  m of crude oil from ecuador at discount prices cuba agreed to let thousands of venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs and in turn venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to cuba at a  discount under petrocaribe programcitation needed third dutch diseaseedit shortages leave shelves empty in this venezuelan store the chávez administration used high oil prices in the s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters the social works initiated by chávezs government relied on oil products the keystone of the venezuelan economy with chávezs administration suffering from dutch disease as a result shortages of gasoline in venezuela in march  according to cannon the state income from oil revenue grew from  of total income in  to   oil exports increased from  in   to  in  and his administrations dependence on petroleum sales was one of the chief problems facing the chávez government by  exports of everything but oil collapsed and in  the world bank explained that venezuelas economy is extremely vulnerable to changes in oil prices since in   of the countrys exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue relied on oil production economists say that the venezuelan governments overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the countrys economy contributing to rising inflation poverty low healthcare spending and shortages in venezuela going into the final years of his presidency according to analysts the economic woes venezuela suffered under president nicolás maduro would have still occurred with or without chávez by  pdvsa could not even afford to export oil through international water which requires safety inspections and

already utilized crude oils and asphalts from petroleum seeps which ooze through the ground to the surface in the years before the spanish conquistadors the thick black liquid known to the locals as mene was primarily used for medical purposes as an illumination source and for the caulking of canoes spanish acquisitionedit upon arrival in the early th century the spanish conquerors learned from the indigenous people to use the naturally occurring bitumen for caulking their ships as well and for treating their weapons the first documented shipment of petroleum from venezuela was in  when a single barrel of oil was sent to spain to alleviate the gout of emperor charles v –edit juan vicente gómez ancient office of mene grande oil company despite the knowledge of the existence of oil reserves in venezuela for centuries the first oil wells of significance were not drilled until the early s in  juan vicente gómez replaced his ailing predecessor cipriano castro as the president of venezuela over the next few years gómez granted several concessions to explore produce and refine oil most of these oil concessions were granted to his closest friends and they in turn passed them on to foreign oil companies that could actually develop them one such concession was granted to rafael max valladares who hired caribbean petroleum company later acquired by royal dutch shell to carry out his oil exploration project on  april  upon the completion of the zumaquei now called mgi oil well the first venezuelan oilfield of importance mene grande was discovered by caribbean petroleum in the maracaibo basin this major discovery encouraged a massive wave of foreign oil companies to invade venezuela in an attempt to get a piece of the action from  to  several more oil fields were discovered across the country include the emblematic bolivar coastal field however world war i slowed significant development of the industry due to the difficulty in purchasing and transporting the necessary tools and machinery some oil companies were forced to forego drilling until after the war by the end of  the first refining operations began at the san lorenzo refinery to process the mene grande field production and the first significant exports of venezuelan oil by caribbean petroleum left from the san lorenzo terminal by the end of  petroleum appeared for the first time on the venezuelan export statistics at  metric tons it was the blowout of the barroso no  well in cabimas in  that marked the beginning of venezuelas modern history as a major producer this discovery captured the attention of the nation and the world soon dozens of foreign companies acquired vast tracts of territory in the hope of striking it rich and by  venezuela became the worlds leading oil exporter oil ended venezuelas relative anonymity in the eyes of world powers making it a linchpin of an everexpanding international oil industry and a new consideration in global policymaking venezuelas oil production became a major factor in policy making in washington before the second world war cabimas still plays an important role in production from the nations largest oil fields which are located around and beneath lake maracaibo other fields are increasing in importance mainly in eastern venezuela about twenty years after the installation of the first oil drill venezuela had become the largest oil exporter in the world and after the united states the second largest oil producer exports of oil boomed from  to  between  and  by the end of the s venezuela had become the thirdleading oil producer in the world behind the united states and the soviet union as well as the leading exporter first dutch diseaseedit by  the dramatic development of the venezuela oil industry had begun to dominate all other economic sectors in the country however agricultural production began to decrease dramatically this sudden increase of attention to oil and neglect of the agrarian sector caused the venezuelan economy to suffer from a phenomenon known as the dutch disease this disease occurs when a commodity brings a substantial increase of income in one sector of the economy causing a strengthening of currency which in turn harms exports of manufacturing and other sectors agriculture accounted for about onethird of economic production in the s but by the s this fraction dramatically reduced to onetenth this sudden increase of oil production restricted venezuelas overall ability to create and maintain other industries the government had ignored serious social problems including education health infrastructure agriculture and domestic industries causing venezuela to fall well behind other industrialized countriescitation needed xenophobiaedit with a large influx of foreign invaders the effects of a xenophobia that had not been seen before became apparent novelist jose rafael pocaterra described the oilmen as the new spaniards he wrote in  one day some spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs a grotesque stork with crystal eyes they drew something on a piece of paper and opened their way through the forest other new spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways rufino blanco fombona a venezuelan writer and politician accounts for the conflict between venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his  novel la bella y la fiera the workers asked

states and oil prices rising steeply venezuela experienced a significant increase in oil production profits between  and  the venezuelan government revenues had quadrupled with a new sense of

profits to increase employment fight poverty increase income and diversify the economy however opec members had been violating production quotas and oil prices fell drastically again in the s pushing venezuela deeper into debt nationalizationedit petroleum map of venezuela  well before  venezuela had taken several steps in the direction of nationalization of its oil industry in august  under the presidency of rafael caldera a law was passed that nationalized the countrys natural gas industry also in  the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets plant and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession the movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree  decree  stipulated that all exploration production refining and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the ministry of mines and hydrocarbons nationalization become official when the presidency of carlos andrés pérez whose economic plan la gran venezuela called for the nationalization of the oil industry and diversification of the economy via import substitution the country officially nationalized its oil industry on  january  at the site of zumaque oilwell  mene grande and along with it came the birth of petróleos de venezuela sa pdvsa which is the venezuelan stateowned petroleum company all foreign oil companies that once did business in venezuela were replaced by venezuelan companies each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new national oil company which maintained the structures and functions of its multinational corporation mncpredecessor all the new companies are owned by a holding companypetroven or pdv and in its turned owned by the state ultimately not much had changed in this regard as all venezuelans with leading positions in the mncs took over the leading positions of the respective new companies and therefore still securing their interests in venezuelas oil pdvsa controls activity involving oil and natural gas in venezuela in  in an aggressive internationalization plan pdvsa bought refineries in usa and europe as the american citgo that catapultated it to the thirdlargest oil company in the world –edit after the  oil crisis the brief period of economic prosperity for venezuela was relatively short lived as venezuelan oil minister and opec cofounder juan pablo pérez alfonzo had presciently warned in  ten years from now twenty years from now you will see oil will bring us ruin it is the devils excrement this was the case during the s oil glut opec member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas and once again oil

between  venezuelas industrial production declined from  percent to  percent of the countrys gross domestic product compared to a decrease of  percent to  percent for the rest of latin america but production levels continued to rise until  however the efficiency of pdvsa was brought into question over these years during – the amount of pdvsa’s income that went towards the companys costs was on average  percent leaving a remainder of  percent for the government from  to  however that distribution almost completely reversed to where  percent of pdvsas income were kept by pdvsa leaving a remainder of only  percent for the government –presentedit former venezuelan president hugo chávez there is no question that venezuela under chávez came to experience one of the worst cases of dutch disease in the world foreign policy after hugo chávez officially took office in february  several policy changes involving the countrys oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his bolivarian revolution since then pdvsa has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the orinoco petroleum belt formerly operated by international oil companies exxonmobil conocophillips chevron and total chávez’s policies damaged venezuelas oil industry due to lack of investment corruption and cash shortages the chávez government used pdvsa resources to fund social programmes treating it like a piggybank and pdvsa staff were required to support chávez his social policies resulted in overspending that caused shortages in venezuela and allowed the inflation rate to grow to one of the highest rates in the world according to corrales and penfold chávez was not the first president in venezuelan history to be mesmerized by the promise of oil but he was the one who allowed the sector to decline the most with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency chávezs successor nicolás maduro continued much of the policies created by chávez with venezuela further deteriorating as a result of continuing such policies reinforcement of opecedit at the time of chávezs election opec had lost much of its influence compared to when it was first created a combination of opec members including venezuela regularly ignoring quotas and nonopec countries such as mexico and russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the venezuelan economy one of chávezs main goals as president was to combat this problem by restrengthening opec and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world and in  he hosted the first summit of the headsofstate of opec in  years the second ever goals of this meeting held in caracas included recuperating the credibility of venezuela in opec defending oil prices consolidating relations between venezuela and the arabislamic world and to strengthen opec in generalcitation needed the meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years but much of that is also a consequence of the  september  attacks against the united states the iraq war and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like china and india which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by opec during the preceding period in addition to these events the december  oil strike in venezuela which resulted in a loss of almost mmbpd of crude oil production brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude enabling act laws and controversyedit this section needs additional citations for verification

supporting chávez on the pdvsa towers in maracaibo in  the prochávez national assembly granted chávez the ability to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions on  november  while ruling by decree chávez enacted the new hydrocarbons law which came into effect in january  the laws marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president with both chavistas and antichavistas outraged at the changes for the opposition to chávez such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that chávez was a dictatorintraining chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas such as ten percent of pdvsa’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs he also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over pdvsa and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over pdvsa’s small revenue contributions to the government by  warnings grew of the chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support in december  pdvsa officially went on strike creating a nearcomplete halt on oil production in venezuela the aim of the venezuelan general strike of  was to pressure chávez into resigning and calling early elections the strike lasted approximately two months and the government ended up firing  pdvsa employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the chávez government by january  protests involving hundreds of thousands of venezuelans opposing chávez became common in venezuela in april  mass demonstrations occurred in caracas and chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the  venezuelan coup détat attempt a few months after the failure of the coup and the return of chavez a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an indefinite national strike which in many places turned out to be a forced bosses lock out where the employees were prevented from workingcitation needed when the strike ended substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by  percent this increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over  percent in march  following the strikes chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as renationalization he aimed at improving the efficiency of pdvsa in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in chávezs first term by  the government had a  percent share which was announced to be increased by  percentcitation needed international dealsedit in  pdvsa opened its first office in china and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more venezuelan oil to china so his country can become more independent of the united states the united states currently accounts for  percent of venezuelas exports in  chávez struck a deal with brazilian oil company petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern brazil where crude oil will be sent from both brazil and argentina a similar deal was struck with ecuador where venezuela agreed to refine  barrels  m of crude oil from ecuador at discount prices cuba agreed to let thousands of venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs and in turn venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to cuba at a  discount under petrocaribe programcitation needed third dutch diseaseedit shortages leave shelves empty in this venezuelan store the chávez administration used high oil prices in the s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters the social works initiated by chávezs government relied on oil products the keystone of the venezuelan economy with chávezs administration suffering from dutch disease as a result shortages of gasoline in venezuela in march  according to cannon the state income from oil revenue grew from  of total income in  to   oil exports increased from  in   to  in  and his administrations dependence on petroleum sales was one of the chief problems facing the chávez government by  exports of everything but oil collapsed and in  the world bank explained that venezuelas economy is extremely vulnerable to changes in oil prices since in   of the countrys exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue relied on oil production economists say that the venezuelan governments overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the countrys economy contributing to rising inflation poverty low healthcare spending and shortages in venezuela going into the final years of his presidency according to analysts the economic woes venezuela suffered under president nicolás maduro would have still occurred with or without chávez by  pdvsa could not even afford to export oil through international water which requires safety inspections and

summit of the headsofstate of opec in  years the second ever goals of this meeting held in caracas included recuperating the credibility of venezuela in opec defending oil prices consolidating relations between venezuela and the arabislamic world and to strengthen opec in generalcitation needed the meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years but much of that is also a consequence of the  september  attacks against the united states the iraq war and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like china and india which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by opec during the preceding period in addition to these events the december  oil strike in venezuela which resulted

economy one of chávezs main goals as president was to combat this problem by restrengthening opec and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world and in  he hosted the first summit of the headsofstate of opec in  years the second ever goals of this meeting held in caracas included recuperating the credibility of venezuela in opec defending oil prices consolidating relations between venezuela and the arabislamic world and to strengthen opec in generalcitation needed the meeting could be considered a success given the record high oil prices of the following years but much of that is also a consequence of the  september  attacks against the united states the iraq war and the significant increase in demand for oil from developing economies like china and india which helped prompt a surge in oil prices to levels far higher than those targeted by opec during the preceding period in addition to these events the december  oil strike in venezuela which resulted in a loss of almost mmbpd of crude oil production brought a sharp increase in world prices of crude enabling act

to rule by decree due to the poor economic conditions on  november  while ruling by decree chávez enacted the new hydrocarbons law which came into effect in january  the laws marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president with both chavistas and antichavistas outraged at the changes for the opposition to chávez such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that chávez was a dictatorintraining chávez began setting goals of reinstating quotas such as ten percent of pdvsa’s annual investment budget was to be spent on social programs he also changed tax policies and the oil revenue collection process chavez initiated many of these major changes to exert more control over pdvsa and efficiently deal with the problems he and his supporters had over pdvsa’s small revenue contributions to the government by  warnings grew of the chávez overspending on social programs in order to maintain populist support in december  pdvsa officially went on strike creating a nearcomplete halt on oil production in venezuela the aim of the venezuelan general strike of  was to pressure chávez into resigning and calling early elections the strike lasted approximately two months and the government ended up firing  pdvsa employees and replacing them with workers loyal to the chávez government by january  protests involving hundreds of thousands of venezuelans opposing chávez became common in venezuela in april  mass demonstrations occurred in caracas and chávez was temporarily overthrown by the military during the  venezuelan coup détat attempt a few months after the failure of the coup and the return of chavez a combination of labor unions and business groups called for an indefinite national strike which in many places turned out to be a forced bosses lock out where the employees were prevented from workingcitation needed when the strike ended substantial macroeconomic damage had been done with unemployment up by  percent this increase brought the country to a national unemployment peak of over  percent in march  following the strikes chávez referred to regaining control of the industry as renationalization he aimed at improving the efficiency of pdvsa in the context of distributing a greater amount of its revenues to his government and also by certain changes in taxation certain tax reforms had already been implemented earlier in chávezs first term by  the government had a  percent share which was announced to be increased by  percentcitation needed international dealsedit in  pdvsa opened its first office in china and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers in that region chávez had long stated that he would like to sell more venezuelan oil to china so his country can become more independent of the united states the united states currently accounts for  percent of venezuelas exports in  chávez struck a deal with brazilian oil company petrobras to build an oil refinery in northeastern brazil where crude oil will be sent from both brazil and argentina a similar deal was struck with ecuador where venezuela agreed to refine  barrels  m of crude oil from ecuador at discount prices cuba agreed to let thousands of venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs and in turn venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to cuba at a  discount under petrocaribe programcitation needed third dutch diseaseedit shortages leave shelves empty in this venezuelan store the chávez administration used high oil prices in the s on his populist policies and to gain support from voters the social works initiated by chávezs government relied on oil products the keystone of the venezuelan economy with chávezs administration suffering from dutch disease as a result shortages of gasoline in venezuela in march  according to cannon the state income from oil revenue grew from  of total income in  to   oil exports increased from  in   to  in  and his administrations dependence on petroleum sales was one of the chief problems facing the chávez government by  exports of everything but oil collapsed and in  the world bank explained that venezuelas economy is extremely vulnerable to changes in oil prices since in   of the countrys exports and nearly half of its fiscal revenue relied on oil production economists say that the venezuelan governments overspending on social programs and strict business policies contributed to imbalances in the countrys economy contributing to rising inflation poverty low healthcare spending and shortages in venezuela going into the final years of his presidency according to analysts the economic woes venezuela suffered under president nicolás maduro would have still occurred with or without chávez by

new lines of business with natural gas and refining streams and promote private investment         the implementation of our business plan includes the following initiatives  exploration production and upgrading our exploration and production strategy focuses on increasing our efforts to search for new light and mediumgravity crude oil reserves and the continued replacement of such reserves developing new production areas adjusting our production activities to cater to market demands and agreements reached with opec members and with other oil producing countries maintaining competitive production costs by using stateoftheart technology and completing the development of our orinoco belt projects   refining our refining strategy focuses on upgrading our downstream operations in venezuela the united states and in europe our major worldwide markets by upgrading our product mix to achieve a higher margin of refined petroleum products and to comply with all applicable environmental quality standards  marketing we plan to continue the expansion of our international marketing operations to ensure market growth for our crude oil and refined petroleum products and to increase brand awareness for our products we also intend to strengthen our position in the united states through the efficient distribution by citgo of its refined petroleum products through citgo latin america a wholly owned subsidiary of citgo we plan to introduce the pdv and citgo brands into various latin american and caribbean markets including through wholesale and retail sales of refined

competitive position of our network of service stations lubrication centers and macrostores to continue the development of our commercial network through business relationships and other associations and to increase our product supply to high traffic airports  gas  the development of our gas business is one of our major goals we plan to focus on creating investment opportunities for the private sector in nonassociated gas production expanding our transmission and distribution systems and natural gas liquids extraction processing and fractioning capacity and developing new gas export ventures we intend to operate most of the existing associated natural gas production fields currently assigned to us by the ministry of energy and mines we will continue to explore and develop nonassociated gas reserves with the support of private investment we also intend to support these activities using the gas transmission and distribution systems currently controlled and managed by the ministry of energy and mines the ministry of energy and mines completed a nonassociated gas licensing bid round for exploration and production activities in  new onshore areas in  out of these  areas the following six were allocated and assigned to foreign and domestic investors yucalplacer norte and yucalplacer sur both development areas barrancas tinaco tiznado and barbacoas each exploratory areas we anticipate that gas production will begin at the end of  from the yucalplacer areas we anticipate that development of our gas business strategy will require approximately  million in capital including an investment of approximately  million for transmission and distribution systems we expect that such capital expenditures will be obtained primarily through investments from the private sector see item b liquidity and capital resourcescash flow from investing activities we believe that our natural gas resources and venezuelas geographical location at the center of the atlantic basin puts us in an advantageous position to achieve our goals with respect to our gas business we believe that our gas business plan will also contribute to promoting an increased and more diverse use of natural gas as a fuel and as a raw material in venezuela  petrochemicals  we plan to continue to promote the development of the petrochemical industry in venezuela by maximizing the use of our existing petrochemical infrastructure and by integrating our refineries and petrochemical plants to ensure maximum economic benefit and to promote independence of our business performance from the

aromatic products   orimulsion ® we plan to expand our orimulsion® business and increase our production levels based on anticipated market opportunities mainly in the far east we intend to carry out our planned expansion through joint ventures the growing popularity of orimulsion® as a fuel is due to a new formulation which makes it more environmentally friendly and more economical at this time our entire orimulsion® production is operated to meet the needs of our clients in europe asia and the united states exploration and production         venezuelas proved crude oil reserves have continued to increase over the years with a cumulative production of crude oil from  through december   totaling approximately  billion barrels venezuelas commercial production of crude oil is concentrated in the western zulia basin and the western barinasapure basin in western venezuela and in the monagas and anzoategui states in the eastern basin the large number of fields in production in these three basins are broadly distributed geographically and as a result substantially diversifies our production risk the impact of a loss of production in any one field would be relatively minor when compared to venezuelas total production the western and eastern basins have produced  billion and  billion barrels respectively of crude oil to date substantial portions of the sedimentary basins

        sales of crude oil to affiliates     we supply our international refining affiliates with crude oil and feedstocks either produced by us or purchased in the open market some of our us affiliates have entered into longterm supply contracts with us that require us to supply minimum quantities of crude oil and other feedstocks to such affiliates for a fixed period of typically  to  years these contracts are scheduled to expire in or after          such contracts incorporate price formulas based on the market value of a slate of refined petroleum products deemed to be produced from each particular grade of crude oil or feedstocks less certain deemed refining costs certain actual costs including transportation charges import duties and taxes and a fixed margin which varies according to the grade of crude oil or other feedstocks delivered fixed margins and deemed costs are adjusted periodically by a formula that is primarily based on the rate of inflation because deemed operating costs and the slate of refined petroleum products deemed to be produced for a given barrel of crude oil or other feedstocks do not necessarily reflect the actual costs and yields in any period the actual refining margin earned by the purchaser under the various contracts will vary depending on among other things the efficiency with which such purchaser conducts its operations during such period these contracts are designed to reduce the inherent earnings volatility of the refining and marketing operations of our international refining affiliates other supply contracts between us and our us affiliates provide for the sale of crude oil at market prices         some of the above contracts provide that under certain circumstances if supplies are interrupted we are required to compensate the affected affiliate for any additional costs incurred in securing crude oil or other feedstocks these crude oil supply contracts may be terminated by mutual agreement by either party in the event of a material default bankruptcy or similar financial hardship on the part of the other party or in certain cases if we no longer hold directly or indirectly  or more of the ownership interests in the related affiliate         sales of crude oil to third parties     most of our export sales of crude oil to third parties including customers in the united states with which we

operate at water depths of between  feet and  feet and drill down to about  feet because of the nature of the operation the drilling rig is of a size large enough to house a crew of about one hundred technicians and qualified workers         this new venture into the gas business is seen as a potential contribution to meet the need for diversifying energy sources that help shape venezuelas economic development similarly the success of this project would further strengthen venezuelas commercial competitiveness by improving its position in the global market which has been progressively migrating towards the use of natural gas as a clean nonpolluting fuel environmental and safety matters environmental         the majority of petróleos de venezuelas subsidiaries both in venezuela and

effects of waste disposal and spills of pollutants in the united states and europe our operations are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which may require them to take action to remedy or alleviate the effects on the environment of earlier plant decommissioning or leakage of pollutants          we have an investment plan to comply with the applicable environmental regulations in venezuela this investment plan contemplates approximately  million in capital expenditure from  through  including the following  million for product quality  million for risk control  million for environmental adaptation and  million for other environmentrelated investments         for the purpose of compliance with future fuel specifications both national and international our production projects are aimed at the significant reduction of the sulfur content of fuels         in addition to the activities outlined in our investment plan expenditures of approximately  million are planned for remediation of  production pits as part of a global remediation plan that will culminate in  the pits are excavations made in the soil andor constructions of earth walls that were used in the past to temporarily store the waste generated by the exploration and production activities these excavations were made when there was no appropriate technology available to avoid the use of pits currently pdvsa does not excavate pits as part of its operations         in addition for the period    citgo has planned expenditures of approximately  million to comply with environmental regulations in the united states         in  citgo reached an agreement with a state agency to cease usage of certain surface impoundments at citgos lake charles refinery by  a mutually acceptable closure plan was filed with the state in  citgo and its former owner are participating in the closure and sharing the related costs based on estimated contributions of waste and

agency a ruling on the proposal as amended is expected in  with final closure to begin later in          in january and july  citgo received notices of violation from the us environmental protection agency alleging violations of the clean air act the notices of violation are an outgrowth of an industrywide and multiindustry us environmental protection agency enforcement initiative alleging that many refineries and electric utilities modified air emission sources without obtaining permits under the new source review provision of the clean air act the notices of violation to citgo followed inspections and formal information requests regarding citgos lake charles louisiana and corpus christi texas refineries and the lemont illinois refinery operated by citgo at the request of the us

petroleum dominated the economy throughout the twentieth century in  the petroleum industry provided almost  percent of the gdp  percent of government revenues and  percent of exports before the sharp drop in international oil prices in the s these ratios were considerably higher from  to  the year of the countrys peak production venezuela was the worlds largest exporter of petroleum in  the country ranked as the third leading oil exporter after saudi arabia and iran and contained at least  percent of proven world oil reserves the countrys national petroleum company the venezuelan petroleum corporation petróleos de venezuela sapdvsa the third largest international oil conglomerate owned refineries and service stations in north america and europe although venezuela was only the third largest petroleum producer in the western hemisphere behind the united states and mexico its proven reserves at  billion barrels in  exceeded those of both countries venezuela exported  percent of its petroleum to the united states in  representing about  percent of american petroleum imports the first commercial drilling of petroleum in venezuela took place in  after world war i british and american multinational oil companies rushed to lago de maracaibo to tap the countrys huge petroleum reserves oil jumped from  percent of exports to  percent from  to  the industry proved extremely lucrative to the scores of foreign companies that drilled venezuelan crude because of the countrys low wages and nominal taxes policies supported by corrupt relations between foreign oil companies and various military dictatorships in the fortyyear period after the death of juan vicente gómez in  the government and foreign oil companies engaged in a tugofwar over taxation regulation and ultimately ownership although venezuela reaped substantially greater benefits from its generous oil endowment after  corruption and deceit on the part of the foreign companies and avaricious caudillos such as pérez jiménez still limited the national benefits of the industry by the early s the possible nationalization of the oil industry became the focus of debate among labor businesses professionals government and the public at large aware of the conflicts and subsequent difficulties of mexicos sudden dramatic nationalization of the entire oil industry in the s venezuela pursued its acquisition of the petroleum sector cautiously and deliberately in december  a national commission created by president pérez delivered a proposal for nationalization this proposal formed the core of the  law that nationalized the oil industry the most controversial element of the new law was article  which gave the government the authority to contract out to multinational firms for various technical services and marketing despite the controversy article  provided technical expertise that proved crucial to the industrys smooth transition to state control beginning on january   in  the government created a holding company pdvsa to serve as the umbrella organization for four major petroleum producing affiliates this process consolidated the holdings of fourteen foreign companies and one national company the venezuelan petroleum corporation corporación venezolana de petróleoscvp into four competing and largely autonomous subsidiaries industry analysts have credited the competitive structure of the subsidiaries with increasing overall efficiency to levels well above those of most nationalized companies the largest subsidiary of pdvsa was lagoven which was composed mainly of the facilities previously operated by the united states oil company exxon lagoven accounted for  percent of national output in  from the holdings of british and dutch shell pdvsa created a subsidiary called maraven four smaller united states companies became meneven finally pdvsa consolidated six smaller foreign firms and the state oil company into corpoven a slump in world oil prices beginning in  rolled back the substantial revenues acquired and largely squandered during the s the symbolic end of pdvsas prosperity came in  when the central bank of venezuela seized us billion of the oil companys earnings to help offset the countrys growing external debt problems this action effectively eliminated pdvsas autonomy after oil prices dropped nearly  percent in  the government accelerated industrial diversification programs in specialized petroleum refining natural gas petrochemicals and mining and also stepped up oil exploration efforts exploration remained a major focus of pdvsa activities in the s at the time of nationalization in  exploration efforts had come to a near standstill little exploratory activity took place during the s and s because the venezuelan government did not grant any new oil concessions after  and most foreign oil companies anticipated eventual nationalization although financial constraints slowed the pace of exploratory drilling in the s major new finds of light medium and heavy crude by  nearly doubled proven reserves the countrys  oil reserves were expected to last for at least ninetythree years at prevailing rates of extraction the orinoco heavy oil belt accounted for  percent of proven reserves in  followed by the maracaibo region with  percent the eastern venezuelan basin with  percent and  percent in other areas see fig  only a small fraction of the orinocos total heavy oil deposits however were routinely included in estimates of total proven reserves because of the cost and difficulty of extraction some estimates of total recoverable heavy crude reserves ran as high as  to  billion barrels pdvsas early exploration strategy emphasized heavy crude but by the s the companys efforts shifted toward more valuable light and medium grades this approach proved successful as major new discoveries were made in the lago de maracaibo area the apurebarinas basin in southwest venezuela near the colombian border and in the eastern venezuelan basin in the el furrialmusipán area in the state of monagas encouraged by its finds in the mids pdvsa launched further drilling operations in the late s with the goal of adding  billion barrels of light and medium crude to its proven reserves by  in addition to its landbased drilling pdvsa established an increasing number of offshore rigs the venezuelans also explored off the coast of aruba and had discussed with the governments of guyana trinidad and tobago and guatemala the prospects of exploratory drilling pdvsa not only extracted crude oil but also refined and distributed a wide variety of petroleum products in  six active refineries in venezuela boasted an installed refining capacity of approximately  million barrels of oil a day these refineries produced a full range of oil products and specialty fuels making venezuela an international leader in petroleum refining see table  table  appendix pdvsa increased the percentage of locally refined crude from  percent to  percent between  and  in  the country for the first time exported more refined petroleum than crude pdvsa diversified its production during the s increasing the share of petroleum products that fell outside opec quotas until the late s in an effort to enhance price stability and boost profits orinoco asphalt bitúmenes del orinoco a pdvsa subsidiary began preliminary shipments in the late s of orimulsión a uniquely venezuelan synthetic fuel derived from orinoco heavy crude water and chemical additives pdvsa hoped to export increasing quantities of orimulsión outside opec quotas to canada and europe as a substitute for coal or fuel oils used by electric power stations from  to  pdvsa acquired overseas refining capacity from at least five multinational oil conglomerates either through production contracts or outright purchases for example in  pdvsa bought a  percent share of the west germanapple laserwriter plusiintiintxaplaspluprsthe swedish lubricant and asphalt producer nynas beginning in  pdvsa entered the united states oil market by purchasing united states oil firms refineries and retail outlets previously held by citgo champlin and unocal pdvsas overseas refining capacity exceeded  barrels per day by the close of the decade by  therefore pdvsa had the capability to refine nearly all of its crude oil production either at home or at venezuelanowned facilities overseas moreover with pdvsas purchase of citgo in  venezuela became the first opec member to wholly own a major united states oil refinery the united states has consistently been venezuelas leading oil export recipient during the s however pdvsa increased its exports to central america and the caribbean in  venezuela and mexico embarked on a joint program called the san josé accord under which the two oil producers exported oil to many countries of the caribbean basin see glossary region at concessionary rates the accord set up a system of compensatory finance and purchases of venezuelan

facebook twitter linkedin email print pdf backgrounder current political and economic issues succinctly explained more on venezuela fossil fuels more on venezuela fossil fuels cesar j alvarez stephanie hanson this publication is now archived introduction venezuela’s proven oil reserves are among the top ten in the world oil generates about  percent of the country’s total export revenue contributes about half of the central government’s income and is responsible for about onethird of the country’s gross domestic product gdp increases in world oil prices in recent years have allowed venezuelan president hugo chavez to expand social program spending bolster commercial ties with other countries and boost his own international profile though chavez has threatened to stop exporting venezuelan oil and refined petroleum products to the united states its biggest oiltrading partner experts say a significant shortterm shift in oil relations between venezuela and the united states is unlikely the mediumterm outlook for state oil company pdvsa is questionable however and analysts draw links between pdvsa’s profitability and the political stability of the country analysts say the recent global financial crisis and sudden drop in oil prices are adding to the oil company’s financial turmoil venezuela’s economy under chavez hugo chavez took office in  since then venezuela’s economy has remained squarely centered on oil production in  chavez announced a nationalization of oil fields managed by foreign companies which resulted in an increase of the government’s shares in these projects from  percent to  percent government officials argue however that economic growth efforts are not solely focused on oil venezuela’s ambassador to the united states bernardo alvarez herrera wrote in a  foreign affairs essay that the nonoil sector which includes mining manufacturing and agriculture grew  percent in  “indicating an important diversification of the country’s economy” yet even if the country is working to diversify“oil still predominates” says miguel tinkersalas a professor of latin american history at pomona college in  the venezuelan economy experienced a significant downturn following a failed military coup to overthrow chavez and a twomonth strike by the staterun oil company pdvsa the response to the strike—the dismissal of more than seventeen thousand pdvsa employees—resulted in a rapid drop in gdp between  and  in subsequent years rising international oil prices helped the economy to recover in  the international monetary fund imf estimates economic growth was  percent opinion is divided over the effect of chavez’s policies on venezuela’s economy some economists say the tremendous rise in social spending under chavez has greatly reduced poverty and pushed unemployment below  percent its lowest level in more than a decade according to a february  report from the washingtonbased center for economic and policy research not only has unemployment dropped formal employment has increased significantly pdf since chavez took office but other economists express concerns about the country’s high inflation levels the imf has forecast inflation of  percent in  and  percent in —among the highest rates for any country in the world—and according to news reports the country is already experiencing food shortages of goods such as sugar and milk francisco rodriguez former chief economist of the venezuelan national assembly writes in a  foreign affairs article that income inequality has increased during chavez’s tenure and further chavez’s social programs have not had a significant impact on infant mortality rate or literacy rates among venezuelans pdvsa pdvsa petróleos de venezuela sa venezuela’s stateowned petroleum company oversees the exploration production refinement and export of oil as well as the exploration and production of natural gas it is the world’s thirdlargest oil company behind saudi aramco and exxonmobil according to tinkersalas after the nationalization of venezuala’s oil in  pdvsa was very much like a “state within a state” it “insulated itself from the government” and functioned largely as its own entity with control of the nation’s wealth in  pdvsa acquired citgo a usbased refinery and it is now one of the world’s largest refiners under chavez however the company’s mandate has drastically expanded in  chavez redefined pdvsa’s role to include the government’s social priorities pdvsa must now spend at least  percent of its annual investment budget on social programs this money is funneled through the national development fund or fonden an investment fund set up in  that is not included in the government’s budget peter hakim president of the interamerican dialogue a washingtonbased center for policy analysis says that chavez’s gradual takeover of pdvsa has given him an enormous bankroll to pursue his political and economic ambitions yet chavez has also moved to expand pdvsa’s role in venezuela’s oil ventures in the s venezuela opened its oil industry to limited private investment and allowed foreign companies to manage specific oil fields such “strategic associations” made up roughly  percent of total oil production as of  in april  chavez announced the government would take a majority stake in such projects increasing its share from  percent to  percent though this partial nationalization is expected to burden pdvsa with investment costs in the billions in  the president created seven new subsidiaries of pdvsa including services agriculture shipbuilding construction and industry the head of pdvsa rafael ramirez told the new yorker in june  that chavez plans to use the oil company to transform venezuela from an oil sultanate to a productive society within a socialist framework the financial crisis and oil price drop has had some impact on the oil company in particular pdvsa lost a  billion line of credit in october  in early  chavez signaled the government would be open to more foreign investment in its oil resources but analysts say there is little trust bloomberg contracts would be honored over the long term chávez is celebrating the demise of capitalism as this international crisis unfolds pedro mario burelli a former board member of pdvsa told the international herald tribune but the irony is that capitalism actually fed his system in times of plenty spending the oil money it is difficult to determine how venezuela has been spending its oil windfall given the lack of government transparency the country ranks  out of  countries ranked on transparency international’s corruption index however from the few official figures the government has released and its stated pledges of aid to foreign countries it is possible to glean a picture of billions of dollars dispersed on activities not directly related to pdvsa’s core business analysts express frustration that these reports lack detail and efforts by news organization to obtain further information from government agencies have been rebuffed nyt pdvsa has transferred billions of dollars to fonden the offbudget investment fund many experts say is financing chavez’s social projects according to international oil daily an energy trade publication pdvsa spent  billion on social programs in  as compared to  billion in  these programs include projects such as medical clinics providing free health care discounted food and household goods centers in poor neighborhoods indigenous landtitling job creation programs outside of the oil business and university and education programs increased oil revenues have also given chavez the ability to extend assistance programs outside venezuela’s borders for example he provides oil at a preferential price to many countries in the caribbean through the petrocaribe initiative in  a venezuelabacked home heating program to lowincome households in the united states was briefly halted a sign that low oil prices may be forcing chavez to reconsider time some of his social programs in august  the associated press calculated that chavez had promised  billion in aid financing and energy funding to latin america and the caribbean between january and august  a figure far higher than the  billion of us assistance for the entire year though it is impossible to determine how much of that funding was actually dispersed the difference in aid is striking chavez is also suspected of funneling money to the farc a colombian guerrilla group as well as providing funds to argentine president cristina kirchner’s election campaign in —though he denies both charges military expenditures are also funded by the government’s flush coffers between  and  venezuela spent roughly  billion on weapons according to a january  defense intelligence agency report as part of deals signed with russia in  venezuela purchased  kalashnikov rifles twentyfour sukhoi fighter planes and fiftythree russian helicopters in march  it hired belarus to build an air defense system critics of chavez think he should be pouring money into infrastructure to ensure a sustainable oil industry rather than allocating so much for social and foreign policy initiatives according to the wall street journal pdvsa “spent just  million on exploration in  compared with  million in ” but vicente frepescibils the lead economist for venezuela at the world bank says “investment is increasing” and venezuela has an accumulation of reserves including outside funds ranging from  billion to  billion that it is planning to use for oil infrastructure pdvsa’s production levels and fiscal health pdvsa has not filed financial statements with the us securities and exchange commission since  as a result its production levels and overall fiscal health are subject to debate among economists and industry analysts a report pdf by the international energy agency examining venezuela’s extraheavy crude oil production put pdvsa’s  production rate at  million barrels per day but showed a decreased rate of  million in september  currently opec the us government and the international energy agency agree that venezuelan oil production amounts to roughly  million barrels per day the venezuelan government however says pdvsa’s production is about  million barrels per day either way there are new signs that all isn’t rosy at pdvsa in  venezuela’s energy ministry released unaudited results documenting a  percent fall in profits by pdvsa the previous year a few months later audited figures were released that indicated profits increased  percent in  the international energy agency however shows a  billion loss in  oil prices which were extraordinarily high through much of  helped mask some of the company’s financial woes since they began to drop dramatically pdvsa has struggled to keep up with its financial obligations especially once it lost a  billion line of credit cnbc with the royal bank of scotland in october  the company had about  billion in unsettled accounts latin business chronicle between january and september  up from  billion during all of  but analysts say so far the company is unlikely to default on its creditors however the company may need to make serious cutbacks or possibly even sell assets analysts say venezuela has an estimated  billion barrels of proven conventional crude oil reserves and an additional estimated  billion barrels of unconventional extraheavy crude oil in the orinoco belt region located southeast of caracas if development in the region can turn this extraheavy tarlike oil into a more marketable commodity venezuela’s total reserves could rival those of saudi arabia reports the new york times oxford analytica notes however that pdvsa will struggle to develop its heavyoil reserves in a timely fashion given its lack of infrastructure investment and the ongoing oil nationalizations oil industry experts suggest that pdvsa needs to invest at least  billion annually into its existing fields just to maintain current production levels regional ventures venezuela is south america’s thirdlargest market and is actively pursuing further economic integration with other countries in the region in july  it became a member of the south american trade group mercosur mercado común del sur joining brazil argentina uruguay and paraguay chavez has also spurred the creation of a regional development bank known as banco del sur highlights of venezuela’s recent regional agreements include argentina venezuela and argentina have made agreements to

repeatedly threatened to cut off its oil exports to the united states analysts say the two countries are mutually dependent venezuela supplies about  million barrels of crude oil and refined petroleum products to the us market every day according to the eia venezuelan oil comprises about  percent of us crude oil imports which amounts to  percent of venezuela’s total exports pdvsa also wholly owns five refineries in the united states and partly owns four refineries either through partnerships with us companies or through pdvsa’s us subsidiary citgo a us government accountability office gao report pdf says venezuela’s exports of crude oil and refined petroleum products to the united states have been relatively stable with the exception of the strike period the world bank’s frepescibils says “venezuela will continue to be a key player in the us market” he argues that in the short term it will be very difficult for venezuela to make a significant shift in supply from the united states nevertheless chavez has increasingly made efforts to diversify his oil clients in order to lessen the country’s dependence on the united states the gao report says the sudden loss of venezuelan oil in

products  through nynäs we refine crude oil and market and transport asphalt specialty products lubricants and other refined petroleum products   in venezuela we have been conducting our petrochemical activities mainly through pequiven which has three petrochemical complexes in venezuela and  joint ventures with private sector partners  however as previously discussed the venezuelan government decided in june  to transfer pequiven to the ministry of energy and petroleum and pequiven is currently evaluating the sale and transfer of its  joint ventures  nevertheless pdvsa will supply the feedstocks required by pequiven see also item b business overview  marketing  marketing in venezuela  petrochemicals   the gas business is conducted by the previously mentioned divisions east and west exploration and production divisions while the gas downstream operations and lng segments are conducted by pdvsa gas  cvp manages offshore gas natural projects   since  deltaven a local retailing subsidiary has marketed and distributed retail gasoline and other refined petroleum products in venezuela under the pdv brand  deltaven also is promoting the development of the commercial infrastructure and services for retail clients together with the private sector   furthermore pdvsa finance was established in  to serve as our principal vehicle for corporate financing through the issuance of unsecured debt   another important subsidiary is intevep through which we manage our research and development activities  pdvsa also has an educational center cied which is responsible for the training and development of our personnel  cied is currently under a restructuring process to better suit current pdvsas needs   see item c organizational structure for a list of our significant subsidiaries   according to a comparative study published by petroleum intelligence weekly on december   based on a combination of operating criteria and other data for  such as reserves production refining capacity and refined petroleum product sales pdvsa is the worlds fourth largest vertically integrated oil and gas company ranked fifth in the world in production fifth in proved reserves of crude oil fourth in refining capacity and eighth in product sales  venezuela has been exporting crude oil primarily to the united states continously since   at the end of  we exported to the us market approximately  mbpd of crude oil and petroleum products and by december  we were exporting to the us market approximately  mbpd of crude oil and petroleum products   the oil sector has a great impact on the venezuelan economy  in  pdvsa accounted for approximately  of venezuelan gross domestic product  of its exports and  of government revenues  in  pdvsa accounted for approximately  of venezuelan gross domestic product  of its exports and  of government revenues   business strategy   our business strategy is focused on the development of venezuelas hydrocarbon resources on behalf of the country with the support of both national and foreign private capital  this strategy aims to maximize the value of oil and gas resources and also to ensure our financial strength and stability within the context of the dynamics of the energy market  since oil is a nonrenewable resource with an expected imbalance between oil demand and supply for the midterm we continue to participate actively in the world oil market in order to receive a fair and stable oil price  investments have to be made to avoid this expected imbalance especially considering that it is predicted that an imbalance between the installed refining capacity and the market for refined products also exists   this core strategy has been ratified in the  corporate business plan      pdvsa plans to intensively invest in both upstream and downstream projects in order to satisfy the current and expected increasing energy demand   according to this plan for  operations in venezuela will focus on          the exploration of condensate light and medium crude oil  pdvsa financial resources will be mainly concentrated on the backyard areas  all other exploration regions either onshore or offshore are opened for third party participation under the umbrella of the venezuelan organic hydrocarbon law gaseous hydrocarbon organic law and of course the national constitution          the production and marketing of the heavy and extraheavy crude oil including the huge reserves in the orinoco belt  according to the laws mentioned above pdvsa is willing to develop new business opportunities with third parties in order to manufacture high quality products          the gas sector development  pdvsa is planning thefast track development of this business segment with third party participation in either onshore or offshore and under the framework of venezuelas gaseous hydrocarbon law          in the downstream business we are looking for the right balance between our overseas and local assets in order to assure the domestic supply and quality for customers in line with the strategy of maximizing the value of venezuelan oil and gas resources          a new strategic objective consists of developing a sustainable social plan of large dimensions aligned with the social plan of the venezuelan government  pdvsas social plan includes education agricultural infrastructure and localregional development projects which will generate about  million direct and indirect jobs and benefit  million people in venezuela          we estimate that our business plan will require about  billion excluding pequiven to achieve a sustainable production capacity of  mbpd by   we expect to provide about  of the funds required for this plan from our own resources and  by means of different financing sources  the following chart shows a summary of actual and estimated capital expenditures   capital investment plan    for venezuela  in millions       actual                      total

operations and we aim to achieve effective and timely integration of business technologies in our operational activities to develop a sustainable competitive advantage  we also endeavor to provide quality training for our personnel finally the      business plan seeks to help to strengthen the national economy and to contribute to social programs such as education healthcare and job creation   we invested  million in operating assets in   this expenditure was  lower than we had anticipated in our previous business plan  this was due to technical difficulties resulting from sabotage against the venezuelan oil industry in december  and the first quarter of   additionally in  pdvsa expensed  million as a contribution to social programs in venezuela   furthermore we will support the process of latin america and caribbean energy and economic integration promoted by the venezuelan government  we will also contribute effectively to put into practice the governmental initiative of building a new worldwide multipolar system of international relations based on justice mutual respect and social equity  this initiative will allow venezuelan people to achieve a better standard of living with less poverty and sustainable development   these new social commitments have not to date materially or adversely impacted pdvsa petróleoss ability to generate the necessary flow of eligible receivables to support payments on our indebtedness   as part of our business strategy we intend to   with respect to exploration production and upgrading activities           incorporate reserves of light and medium gravity crude oil          increase our overall recovery factor          continue the development of our orinoco belt extraheavy crude oil projects and          leverage existing technology in order to maximize the return on our investments   with respect to refining and marketing           assure product enhancement and environmental compliance in venezuela and abroad          expand and diversify our markets into latin america caribbean and asia including china and india and          improve the efficiency of our refining processes and marketing activities   with respect to natural gas           actively promote the national and international private sector participation in onshore and offshore nonassociated gas reserves exploitation and processing          enhance our distribution processes in order to increase the breadth of our domestic and international markets and          assure participation in the liquified natural gas lng markets   with respect to petrochemicals           provide feedstocks and other raw material to pequiven in a timely manner and continue to evaluate opportunities for petrochemical product development in our refineries abroad   the execution of pdvsas corporate plan includes the following initiatives or business             exploration production and upgrading  the exploration and production strategy focuses on increasing our efforts to search for new light and medium gravity crude oil reserves and the systematic replacement of such reserves in back yard areas developing new production areas adjusting our production activities to cater market demands and agreements reached among opec members and other oil producing countries  for this purpose we will acquire  km of d seismic lines  km  of d seismic lines and drill about  exploratory wells  pdvsa will drill some  production wells and perform maintenance rarc on  wells among other activities in order to reach a production capacity of  mbpd by   pdvsa is also making efforts to maintain competitive production costs by using stateoftheart technology  the first four orinoco belt projects have been completed and are in full operation hamaca a pdvsa  conocophillips  chevron texaco joint venture petrozuata a joint venture between pdvsa and conocophillips cerro negro a pdvsa  exxonmobil  bp joint venture sincor a pdvsa  totalfina  statoil joint venture  these strategic alliances are currently producing more than  mbpd of heavy and extraheavy crudes  pdvsa will start a project to quantify and to certify proved hydrocarbons reserves in the orinoco belt in order to determine the economic prospects and thus properly direct future business in that area          refining  our refining strategy focuses on improving the efficiency of our downstream operations  in venezuela we will construct three new refineries cabruta  mbpd barinas  mbpd and caripito  mbpd  also we will add deep conversion capacity to the puerto la cruz crp amuay and cardón and el palito refineries in order to increase the efficiency of heavy crude oil processing  in our refineries in the united states europe and the caribbean we will invest in order to comply with quality standards demanded by those markets  additionally we will invest in the refineries of kingstonjamaica and cienfuegoscuba and develop a new refinery with petrobras in the north of brazil and in a deep conversion project in la teja refinery in uruguay  we continue to aim to achieve a higher margin on refined petroleum products and to comply with all applicable environmental quality standards see item b business overview  refining and marketing          marketing  the plan considers continuing the expansion of our international marketing operations to ensure market share growth for our crude oil and refined petroleum products and to increase brand recognition for the products  also we seek to diversify our customer portfolio by entering new markets such as china and india  pdvsa will expand its operations in the caribbean and south america through the petroamerica initiative which includes the petrosur petrocaribe and petroandina initiatives in order to promote regional integration and a fair energy distribution among the latin american nations  we aim to maintain our market position in the us through a more efficient distribution system of citgo and its refined petroleum products  citgo international latin america inc cila which sells lubricants gasoline and distillates in various latin american countries was recently transferred to interven venezuela and is currently evaluating the operation of its various subsidiaries see item b business overview  refining and marketing  additionally in order to improve our logistic and marine transportation capabilities pdvsa will construct  tankers through strategic agreements with argentina brazil china and spain to increase from  to  the number of ships owned and operated by our subsidiary pdv marina          in venezuela we plan to continue to promote a reliable supply of our products and the use of unleaded gasoline a process started during the fourth quarter of  to improve the competitive position of our network of service stations lubrication centers and macrostores to continue the development of our commercial network through business relationships and other associations and to increase our product supply to hightraffic airports  also we are developing an ethanol production project in order to substitute octane enhancement additives such as tel and mtbe in the production of gasoline  with the use of ethanol we will have environmentally friendlier products and at the same time we will be promoting agricultural and social development in rural areas due to the fact that ethanol is produced from agricultural feedstocks such as sugarcane          gas  the development of the gas business is one of our major goals  we plan to focus on creating attractive investment opportunities for the private sector in nonassociated gas production expanding      our transmission and distribution systems and natural gas liquids extraction processing and fractioning capacity and developing new gas export ventures including exports of lng  we intend to operate most of the existing associated natural gas production fields currently assigned to us by the ministry of energy and petroleum  we will continue to explore and develop nonassociated gas reserves with the support of private investment  we expect to support the activities related to our gas business using our existing gas transmission and distribution systems          the ministry of energy and mines currently known as the ministry of energy and petroleum completed a round of onshore nonassociated gas licensing bids for exploration and production activities in  new onshore areas in   six of those areas were awarded to foreign and domestic investors  yucalplacer norte and yucalplacer sur both development areas barrancas tinaco tiznado and barbacoas each exploratory areas  the yucalplacer areas produced  mmcfd in  and approximately  mmcfd are expected to be in production by   during the first quarter of  the venezuelan government assigned two blocks within the deltana platform area eastern venezuela and on the maritime border with trinidad  tobago to statoil and chevrontexaco and conocophillips  more recently it has assigned another block to chevrontexaco  additionally we have under way a new bidding round to explore and develop offshore resources in the west and northeast of venezuela such developments will principally include projects for the production of lng once the local demand in venezuela has been satisfied  we have defined an offshore natural gas project called rafael urdaneta located in the venezuelan gulf and northeast of falcon state with an area of  km   split into  blocks to be offered in two phases  phase one was initiated beginning the second quarter of  when the venezuelan government offered the first six blocks to  national and foreign oil companies  of this offer blocks urumaco i and ii were awarded to the russian company gazprom while block cardon iii was awarded to chevrontexaco          we anticipate that development of our gas business segment will require approximately  billion in capital from  to   we expect that such capital expenditures will be obtained primarily from the private sector including partners          we believe that our natural gas resources and venezuelas geographical location at the center of the atlantic basin puts us in an advantageous position to achieve our goals by   we intend to capitalize on our advantages by promoting an increased and more diverse use of natural gas within the country          at this time the orimulsion® production is operated just to meet the needs of our clients in europe asia and the united states  during  we conducted a full review of this business  the outcome of such analysis showed that a reevaluation of our strategy was necessary within the framework of the new corporate strategy in order to maximize the value of venezuelan natural resources  since that reassessment we produce only enough orimulsion® to comply with our existing contracts  a new production module sinovensa will be in place by the end of  in order to supply the existing agreements   exploration and production   venezuelas proved crude oil reserves have continued to increase over the years with a cumulative production of crude oil from  through december   totaling approximately  billion barrels  venezuelas commercial production of crude oil is concentrated in the western zulia basin and the western barinas  apure basin in western venezuela and in the monagas and anzoategui states in the eastern basin  the large number of fields in production in these three basins are broadly distributed geographically and as a result substantially diversifies our production risk  the impact of a loss of production in any one field would be relatively minor when compared to venezuelas total production  the western and eastern basins have produced  billion and  billion barrels respectively of crude oil to date  substantial portions of the sedimentary basins in venezuela have not yet been explored      principal

crude oil and natural gas reserves including proved developed and undeveloped reserves  such data is capable of demonstrating with reasonable certainty whether such reserves are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  we expect to recover proved crude oil and natural gas reserves principally from new wells and acreage that has not been drilled using currently available equipment and operating methods  our estimates of reserves are not precise and are subject to revision  we review these crude oil and natural gas reserves annually to take into account among other things production levels field reviews the addition of new reserves from discoveries yearend prices and economic and other factors  proved reserve estimates may be

over two billion barrels of crude oil  on april   we approved phase i of the development plan for this field involving a capital investment of approximately  million by investors and an expected production level of  million barrels of crude oil over the next  years  phase i of this development will be conducted using a wellhead platform a floating production unit with a separate accommodations platform pipeline to a floating storage offtake vessel fso and a mooring buoy for loading arriving tankers  phase i also will include water injection for pressure maintenance  the produced associated gas will be stored in an aquifer zone wholly contained within the overall corocoro gas column  the operator will manage the facilities design construction installation and subsequent production operations  a total of  wells will be drilled comprising  producers  water injectors  gas injectors and one utility well  we estimate an average production of  mbpd in  increasing to  mbpd in or after    it is currently projected that phase ii expected to commence in  would involve a further  million of investments to recover additional reserves of up to  million barrels of crude oil from the field  we believe that we can make an efficient transition from phase i to phase ii by using existing production facilities in the second phase  the total project cost for phase i and phase ii is estimated at  per barrel comprising  per barrel for development and  per barrel for operations   in  we invested  million for exploratory activities related to the western paria gulf field  additionally in  we drilled four development wells in that field which required a total investment of  million  in the la ceiba field we began drilling wells la ceiba x and la ceiba x and depending on the evaluation of the results of those wells a declaration of commercial operation will be issued to then begin the construction of production facilities to handle the early crude oil production with an estimated investment of approximately  million   orinoco belt extraheavy crude oil projects   the venezuelan congress approved the creation of four vertically integrated joint venture projects in the orinoco belt for the exploitation and upgrading of extraheavy crude oil of average api gravity of ° and marketing of the upgraded crude oil with api gravities ranging from ° to °  these joint venture projects have been implemented through association agreements between the various participating entities and pdvsa  the term of each association agreement is approximately  years after commencement of commercial production and upon termination the foreign participants ownership is transferred to pdvsa  each of the projects is assigned an area that is expected to contain sufficient recoverable extraheavy oil to meet planned output during the life of the association  for the foreign partners the projects represent a significant opportunity to increase production and proved crude oil reserves  for us the projects represent an opportunity to develop the orinoco belts extraheavy crude oil reserves   each of these associations are required to pay the standard venezuelan corporate tax rate of  as compared to a tax rate of  that is applicable to our venezuelan subsidiaries engaged in the production of hydrocarbons  in addition they pay a production tax ranging between  to   measured depending on accumulated revenues and total investment  these tax conditions were modified in october   see note a to our consolidated financial statements included under item   financial statements  also these strategic associations benefit from a  investment tax credit on capital investments made after december   plus an additional  on capital investments that contribute to the environmental preservation of their operational areas   the four joint venture projects in the orinoco belt are as follows          the petrozuata joint venture   petrozuata is a company owned by pdvsa petróleo a subsidiary of pdvsa and conocophillips  the construction of facilities at petrozuata began in   initial production of extraheavy crude oil commenced in august   upgraded facilities were completed      in   during  petrozuata produced  mbpd of extraheavy crude oil and  mbpd of upgraded crude oil with an average api gravity ranging from ° to °  under the terms of the joint venture agreement conocophillips has agreed to undertake the refining process at its lake charles refinery in lake charles louisiana  by december  total investments in this project amounted to  million          the sincor joint venture   sincrudos de oriente is a joint venture owned by pdvsa sincor a subsidiary of pdvsa totalfina and statoil  in  this joint venture produced  mbpd of extraheavy crude oil and  mbpd of upgraded crude oil with an average api gravity ranging from ° to °  we anticipate that this joint venture will reach a production level of  mbpd of upgraded crude oil by   by december  total investments in this project amounted to  million          the hamaca joint venture   petrolera hamaca is a company owned by corpoguanipa a subsidiary of pdvsa chevrontexaco and conocophillips  hamaca started producing upgraded crude oil in october  achieving by the end of that year a production of  mbpd with an average api gravity of ° to °  in  average production of extraheavy crude oil was  mbpd and average production of diluted crude oil was  mbpd with an average gravity of ° api  by december  total investments in this project amounted to  million of which  million was invested in           the cerro negro joint venture   petrolera cerro negro is a company owned by pdvsa cerro negro sa a subsidiary of pdvsa exxonmobil and bp formerly veba oel  pursuant to the terms of this joint venture agreement we have agreed to sell our share of upgraded crude oil produced by this joint venture approximately  of total production to chalmette refining a refinery in chalmette louisiana which is an equal share joint venture between pdvsa and exxonmobil  during  this joint venture produced  mbpd of extraheavy crude oil and  mbpd of upgraded crude oil with an average api gravity of °  by december  total investments in this project amounted to  million  see item b business overviewrefining and marketingrefining and note a to our consolidated financial statements included under item   financial statements   the orinoco belt projects differ primarily by the quantity and quality of output  for the hamaca and sincor joint ventures the projects are designed to produce upgraded crude oil that can be sold to thirdparty refiners who would otherwise process light sweet conventional crude oil  for the petrozuata and cerro negro joint

eastern university universidad del zulia zulia university and universidad central de venezuela central university of venezuela  in these agreements we auctioned the right to reactivate rehabilitate and develop fields located in three geographical areas  the purpose of these agreements with the national universities is to provide training and industry experience to venezuelan university students especially geophysics petroleum engineers and geology students   each field will be developed by separate entities that are  owned by us and  owned by the respective universities  these fields are  socororo located in anzoátegui state operated by petroucv sa with an assigned surface of  square km mara este located in the zulia state operated by oleoluz sa with an assigned surface of  square km and jobo located in monagas state operated by petroudo sa with an assigned surface of  square km  the total assigned area for all these fields is approximately  square kilometers  as of december   these fields have estimated proved reserves of approximately  mmb of crude oil consisting of  mmb at socororo  mmb at mara este and  mmb at jobo respectively with an average api gravity of ° to ° api  during  the total oil production under these operating service agreements was  mbpd  we expect these fields to produce approximately  mbpd by   we also anticipate investing a total of approximately  million in these fields over the next  years  by december  total expenditures amounted to  million   overview of main projects with private sector participation   the plataforma deltana project   the plataforma deltana area is located  km offshore east of the orinoco river delta and southeast of the territorial border with the republic of trinidad and tobago trinidad and tobago  for bidding and business purposes the zone has been divided into five blocks mainly prospective for nonassociated gas  the main objective of the project is to confirm and develop new nonassociated natural gas reserves to meet domestic market requirements as well as for export mainly to the atlantic basin   the first exploration phase with disbursement amounting to  million was completed by pdvsa on july   in an area of  square kilometers next to the territorial border with trinidad  tobago  such exploration activity resulted in an increase of the nonassociated natural gas reserves estimates to  trillion cubic feet as audited by the specialized firm ryder scott  a  tcf short term proven reserves objective is being considered as part of the second exploratory phase being executed in the period  by the companies working in the area under the granted licenses to assure the commercial development of the plataforma deltana area  total investment in this project has been estimated at approximately  billion   licenses for exploration and development for blocks  and  were granted by the ministry of energy and petroleum to three international oil and gas companies in february  chevrontexaco and conocophillips in block  and statoil in block   the international companies are committed to a minimum exploratory program with an estimated investment of  million drilling activities started in august  and to subsequent investments for development if commercial viability is confirmed  pdvsas participation in the partnership which could range from  to  will be determined upon declaration of commercial viability   the selection process of partners for block  was completed in   in february  the ministry of energy and petroleum granted the license for exploration and development to chevrontexaco  block  is reserved for business opportunities subject to an unitization agreement with trinidad and tobago  on august  a memorandum of understanding was signed between the two countries to manage all common reservoirs along the territorial border  the exploratory program for this block will cost approximately  million block  remains for future growth opportunities   the natural gas produced offshore will be processed onshore in a new industrial complex to be located near the city of guiria in sucre state in the north east of venezuela  it is planned that this industrial complex will also      serve the lng mariscal sucre and other gas projects in the region  the application of international health safety and environment standards and sustainable development practices are key strategies for the development of this area  this project will contribute to venezuelas natural gas business expansion and will further diversify the countrys energy sources   mariscal sucre project   the main purpose of this project is the development of north paria fields at the north east of venezuela to produce nonassociated natural gas to supply both local and international markets the project involves production of  million cubic feet of natural gas per day mmcfd the construction of a gas liquefaction train with a design capacity of  million metric tons per year mmty  as a reference one of the development scenarios for the four mariscal sucre projects fields consist of a total of  reservoirs that are going to be drained with  wells and drilled in  development phases over a period of about  years   the first drilling phase comprises  platform wells  average of  days to drill and  days to complete if no downhole chemical injection is needed  and will all be completed with the use of a deepwater cantilever jackup rig  the initial wells will be at río caribe  wells and mejillones  wells from four platforms  the central production facility cpf for the entire development will be located at mejillones and initially it will gather all production  the export pipeline will initiate from this platform and the offshore central control room will be located on this structure  there are no processing facilities on the cpf  the gas condensate and produced water will be routed to the lng plant at güiria by a multiphase export pipeline  all platforms will contain power generation and associated utilities   estimated initial production will be  bpd of stabilized condensate from rio caribe and  mmcfd of gas from all fields  during this phase the bulk of condensate will come from rio caribe   the total estimated investment is  million  first stage activities include basic services dock services port services general services corridors services roads and security residential area and relocation of city airport   refining and marketing   refining   our downstream strategy has been focused on the expansion and upgrading of our refining operations in venezuela the united states and europe allowing us to increase our production of refined petroleum products and upgrade our product slate toward highermargin refined petroleum products  we have also increased the complexity of our refining capacity in venezuela and made extensive investments to convert our worldwide refining assets from simple conversion to deep conversion capabilities  deep conversion capabilities in our venezuelan refineries have enabled us to improve yields by allowing a greater percentage of higher value products to be produced  such capabilities have resulted in an increase in our gasoline and distillate yield from  in  to  in  and has allowed us to reduce our fuel oil production from  to  during the same period resulting in an improved export product portfolio   we conduct refining activities in venezuela the caribbean the united states and europe  our net interest in refining capacity has grown from  mbpd

divested in    in order to maintain our competitiveness within international markets we expect to invest approximately  million from  through  in venezuela to improve our refining systems and to adapt our systems to meet environmental regulations and domestic and international product quality requirements  the refining plan includes projects aimed at manufacturing gasoline  on march   we entered into a contract for approximately  million with a venezuelanjapanese consortium led by the japanese jgc corporation formed by the japanese chiyoda corporation and the venezuelan companies jantesa and vepica to construct naphtha hydrotreating facilities and diesel hydrodesulphurization and environmental units in a refinery located in puerto la cruz referred to in this annual report as the valcor project  the primary objective of this project was to produce unleaded gasoline to meet the demands of the local market and to produce distillates of low sulphur content for export to international markets   the facilities and processing units were completed in december  at a cost of  million  valcor is currently in production mode producing  mbpd of gasoline and  mbpd of diesel blending components   additionally the two fluid catalytic cracking units located at our amuay and cardón refineries paraguaná refining complex  prc are being modified to manufacture more gasoline  a low sulfur gasoline production unit currently in the engineering phase based on our own technology isal® developed by intevep a whollyowned subsidiary of pdvsa is expected to be operational in the amuay refinery by  and another similar unit will be installed at the isla refinery in curacao sometime in the refining plan period  we also plan to increase the heavy crude refining capacity and we foresee the expansion of our delayed coking plants located at the refining complex in paraguaná venezuela and we are also performing studies to increase venezuelas refining capacity   venezuela and the

respectively  we also operate the isla refinery in curaçao which we lease on a longterm basis from the netherlandsantilles government  the lease expires in   through these refineries we produce reformulated gasoline and distillates to meet the us and other international market requirements   united states   through our wholly owned subsidiary citgo we produce light fuels and petrochemicals primarily through our refineries in lake charles louisiana corpus christi texas and lemont illinois  our asphalt refining operations are carried out through refineries in paulsboro new jersey and savannah georgia      citgos largest supplier of crude oil is pdvsa  citgo has entered into longterm crude oil supply agreements with pdvsa with respect to the crude oil requirements for each of citgos lake charles corpus christi paulsboro and savannah refineries  these crude oil supply agreements require pdvsa to supply minimum quantities of crude oil and other feedstocks to citgo usually from  to  years  these crude supply agreements contain force majeure provisions that entitle the supplier to reduce the quantity of crude oil and feedstocks delivered under the crude supply agreements under specified circumstances   the lake charles refinery has a rated refining capacity of  mbpd and is capable of processing large volumes of heavy crude oil into a flexible slate of refined products including significant quantities of highoctane unleaded gasoline and reformulated gasoline  a project to increase the crude oil distillation capacity by  mbpd was completed and became operative by february  so this refinery is currently the fourth largest in the us with a total refining capacity of  mbpd  the lake charles refinerys main petrochemical products are propylene benzene and mixed xylenes  its industrial products include sulphur residual fuels and petroleum coke  this refinery has one of the highest capacity levels for higher valueadded products production in the united states with a multiple stream capacity that allows it to continue operating with one or more units shut down  this refinery has a solomon process complexity rating of  as compared to an average of  for us refineries in solomon associates incs most recently available survey  the solomon process complexity rating is an industry measure of a refinerys ability to produce higher value products  a higher solomon process complexity rating indicates a greater capability to produce such products   the corpus christi refinery has a refining capacity of  mbpd and a processing technology that enables it to produce premium grades of gasoline that exceed that of most of its us competitors and to reduce sulfur levels in refined petroleum products  this refinery has a solomon process complexity rating of   the corpus christi refinerys main petrochemical products include cumene cyclohexane and aromatics including benzene toluene and xylenes   the lemont refinery processes heavy crude oil into a flexible slate of refined products  the refinery has a rated refining capacity of  mbpd and has a solomon process complexity rating of   this refinery is one of the most recently designed and constructed refineries in the united states  it is a flexible deep conversion facility that produces primarily gasoline diesel jet fuel and petrochemicals   the refineries in paulsboro new jersey and savannah georgia are specialized asphalt refineries  the paulsboro refinery which is particularly suited to processing asphalt also has facilities to process low sulfur light crude oil whenever favorable conditions exist   through lyondellcitgo a joint venture owned  by pdvsa and  by lyondell we have a net interest in refining capacity of  mbpd in a refinery located in houston texas with a refining capacity of  mbpd  pdvsa supplies a substantial amount of the crude oil processed by this refinery under a longterm crude oil supply agreement that expires in the year   under this agreement lyondellcitgo purchased approximately  billion of crude oil and feedstocks at market related prices from pdvsa in   citgo purchases substantially all of the gasoline diesel and jet fuel produced at this refinery under a longterm contract   various disputes exist between lyondellcitgo and its partners and their respective affiliates concerning the interpretation of agreements between the parties relating to the operation of the refinery   pdvsa petróleo pursuant to its contractual rights under the crude oil supply agreement with lyondellcitgo declared a force majeure situation in april  and again in february  through october  as well as from february  to march   pdvsa pursuant to its contractual rights under the supplemental supply agreement with lyondellcitgo which guarantees pdvsa petróleos obligations under the crude oil supply agreement invoked its right to declare a force majeure situation during the same time periods  as a result of these declarations pdvsa petróleo and pdvsa were relieved of their obligations to deliver crude oil under both agreements and lyondellcitgo purchased crude oil from alternate sources  lyondellcitgo received notice of force majeure from pdvsa petróleo andor pdvsa in december   lyondellcitgo purchased crude oil in the spot market to replace the volume not delivered under contract  the force majeure was lifted on march    in february  lyondellcitgo commenced an action against pdvsa and pdvsa petróleo in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking damages for      alleged breaches of the longterm crude oil supply agreement between lyondellcitgo and lagoven subsequently merged into pdvsa petróleo and the supplemental supply agreement between lyondellcitgo and pdvsa  both agreements are dated may   and expire in   on may   pdvsa and pdvsa petróleo filed a motion to dismiss the case  on august   the judge dismissed one of the ten counts in the complaint allowing the remaining counts to proceed through early stages of litigation  the parties engaged in extensive discovery beginning in november   in the course of expert discovery on september   one of lyondellcitgos retained experts filed a report listing the amount of liquidated damages owed by pdvsa and pdvsa petróleo to lyondellcitgo through september  as   for the same period lyondellcitgos expert calculated the amount of actual damages as  to  depending on the method used to calculate interest  lyondellcitgo also claims additional unspecified amounts for attorneys fees and costs  discovery was formally concluded on october    on october  and october   the magistrate judge issued orders directing pdvsa and pdvsa petróleo to produce all board of directors minutes and related documents to lyondellcitgo  pdvsa informed the magistrate judge that it could not comply with his order because granting lyondellcitgo unrestricted access to pdvsas board of directors materials violated venezuelan law  the magistrate judge entered an adverse inference sanction against pdvsa and pdvsa petróleo ordering that the court may infer that the board of directors documents were unfavorable to pdvsa and favorable to lyondellcitgo  the magistrate judge also ordered that the court may give the strongest weight to the evidence already in the case in favor of lyondellcitgo but may also consider any evidence presented

with crude oil and feedstocks either produced by us or purchased in the open market  some of our us affiliates have entered into longterm supply contracts with us that require us to supply minimum quantities of crude oil and other feedstocks to such affiliates usually for  to  years  these contracts are scheduled to expire in or after    such contracts incorporate price formulas based on the market value of a slate of refined petroleum products deemed to be produced from each particular grade of crude oil or feedstock less certain deemed refining costs certain actual costs including transportation charges import duties and taxes and a deemed margin which varies according to the grade of crude oil or other feedstock delivered  deemed margins and deemed costs are adjusted periodically by a formula primarily based on the rate of inflation  because deemed operating costs and the slate of refined petroleum products deemed to be produced for a given barrel of crude oil or other feedstock do not necessarily reflect the actual costs and yields in any period the actual refining margin earned by the purchaser under the various contracts will vary depending on among other things the efficiency with which such purchaser conducts its operations during such period  these contracts are designed to reduce the inherent earnings volatility of the refining and marketing operations of our international refining affiliates  other supply contracts between us and our us affiliates provide for the sale of crude oil at market prices   some of the above contracts provide that under certain circumstances if supplies are interrupted we are required to compensate the affected affiliate for any additional costs incurred in securing crude oil or other feedstocks  these crude oil supply contracts may be terminated by mutual agreement by either party in the event of      a material default bankruptcy or similar financial hardship on the part of the other party or in certain cases if we no longer hold directly or indirectly  or more of the ownership interests in the related affiliate   sales of crude oil to third parties   most of our export sales of crude oil to third parties including customers in the united states with which we maintain longstanding commercial relationships are made at market prices pursuant to our general terms and conditions and priced in dollars  among our customers are major oil companies and other mediumsized companies  although our general terms and conditions do not require specified volumes to be bought or sold historically a majority of our customers have taken shipments on a regular basis at a relatively constant volume throughout the year   sales of refined products   we conduct all our retail sales in the united states through citgo  citgos major products are light fuels including gasoline jet fuel and diesel fuel industrial products and petrochemicals asphalt and lubricants and waxes  gasoline sales accounted for  of citgos total sales in   citgo markets citgobranded gasoline through approximately  independently owned and operated retail outlets located throughout the united states primarily east of the rocky mountains   citgo also markets jet fuel directly to airline customers at over  airports diesel fuel in wholesale rack sales to distributors and in bulk through contract sales primarily as heating oil in the northeast region of the united states or on a spot basis petrochemicals in bulk to a variety of us manufacturers as raw materials for finished goods including sulfur cycle oils liquid petroleum gas petroleum coke and residual fuel oil asphalt to independent contractors for use in the construction and resurfacing of roadways and many different types grades and container sizes of lubricant and wax products   crude oil and refined product purchases   citgo owns no crude oil reserves or production facilities and must therefore rely on purchases of crude oil and feedstocks for its refinery operations  we are citgos largest supplier of crude oil and citgo has entered into longterm crude oil supply agreements with us with respect to the crude oil requirements for each of citgos refineries  citgo also purchases crude oil in the market  in addition because citgos refinery operations do not produce sufficient refined petroleum products to meet the demands of its branded distributors citgo purchases refined petroleum products primarily gasoline from third party refiners  citgo also purchases refined petroleum products from various other affiliates including lyondellcitgo chalmette refining and hovensa pursuant to longterm contracts  in  citgo purchased  mbpd of refined petroleum products under these contracts  in addition citgo occasionally purchases on a spot basis refined petroleum products from our venezuelan refineries   marketing in europe   we supply crude oil to our european affiliates pursuant to various supply agreements  the crude oil that we supply to our european affiliates exceeds as a percentage of total supply our aggregate net ownership interest in such entities combined refining capacity  in  we supplied to the european refineries in which we held an interest  mbpd of crude oil of which  mbpd were exported from venezuela and  mbpd were purchased in world markets   the crude oil processed at the ruhr oel refineries is supplied  by us and  by deutsche bp pursuant to a joint venture agreement and a longterm supply contract  pursuant to these agreements ruhr does not acquire title to any crude oil or refined petroleum products  instead the crude oil supplied by us or deutsche bp remains owned by us or deutsche bp as applicable throughout the refining process  our share of the refined petroleum products processed at the ruhr oel refineries is distributed through deutsche bps marketing network  the operating costs of the ruhr oel refineries are shared equally by us and deutsche bp   we receive  of the revenues from deutsche bps sales of the refined petroleum products processed at the ruhr oel refineries less attributable operating and marketing costs  this arrangement effectively provides ruhr oel with constant breakeven results  we supply crude oil to the ruhr oel refineries and receive revenues from the sale of refined petroleum products attributable to such crude oil      nynäs purchases crude oil from pdvsa and produces asphalt and naphthenic specialty oils two products for which venezuelan heavy sour crude oil is a particularly well suited feedstock due to its content of naphthenic paraffinic and aromatic compounds  asphalt products are used for road construction and various industrial purposes while naphthenic specialty oils are used principally in electrical transformers as mechanical process oils and in the rubber and printing ink industries  nynäs does not own crude oil reserves or production facilities and therefore must purchase crude oil for its refining operations  nearly all crude oil purchased by nynäs is supplied by us pursuant to longterm supply contracts  we supply nynäs only with high sulfur extraheavy venezuelan crude oil   nynäs markets asphalt products through an extensive marketing network in several european countries  scandinavia the united kingdom and continental europe are the source of   and  respectively of nynäs consolidated revenues for   nynäs markets its naphthenic specialty oils throughout europe africa the middle east and australia and the distillates that it produces are either sold as fuel or further processed into naphthenic specialty oils  nynäs distributes its refined products primarily by a terminal network specialized bitumen ships rail tanks and trucks   marketing in latin america and caribbean   pdvsa has been strengthening a commercial strategy of integration that will allow the completion of several projects in the countries of the region within the scope of the petroamerica initiative which is being promoted by venezuela based on the establishment of cooperation and integration mechanisms and the utilization of the resources and potentials of latin america and the caribbean in order to support the socio economic improvement of its population   the implementation of this initiative is based on bilateral negotiations with the intention of transferring financial resources to the people through the joint action of the states  it is also based on cost rationalization through tax and port services cost reductions and on cooperation agreements not only for energy issues but for education health and infrastructure as well   during  pdvsa supplied under special terms crude oil and refined products to the caribbean and central america by means of the san josé and caracas agreements  furthermore in  we created pdvsacuba in order to promote refining and marketing businesses in the area  in the south american market pdvsa has been making efforts towards the strengthening of the commercial relationships with argentina brazil uruguay paraguay ecuador and bolivia through the endorsement of memoranda of understanding with their national oil enterprises with the intention of studying crude oil and refined products supply opportunities   marketing in venezuela   the following table shows our sales of refined petroleum products and natural gas of the venezuelan domestic market   pdvsas

and distribute retail gasoline and other refined petroleum products under the pdv brand in the venezuelan local market  deltaven is also promoting the development of the commercial infrastructure and services for retail clients with the participation of the private sector   the retail price for gasoline is set by the venezuelan government and represents approximately  of the export price for gasoline in    since the end of  three private domestic participants grupo trebol llanopetrol and ccmonagas and four private international participants shell chevrontexaco exxonmobil and british petroleum have been marketing their products in venezuela  these companies market their brands through  retail outlets owned or operated by them and have a market share in the gasoline and diesel sector of  compared to deltavens    gas   venezuela has abundant natural gas fields  according to bp amoco statistical review of world energy  at november  venezuela was the ninth largest owner of proved reserves in the world and the largest owner of proved reserves in latin america  these reserves were estimated at  bcf at the end of  of which  bcf are proved reserves   of these are associated with crude oil deposits and  are in the form of free gas  our total sales of methane gas in the venezuelan market amounted to  mmcfd by december    petrochemicals   the venezuelan government decided in june  to transfer the activities assets and shares held by pdvsa in pequiven the companys shareholder to the ministry of energy and petroleum and to submit this transfer for approval by the shareholder of pdvsa  the transfer is subject to the reform of the petrochemical act and the resolution of other legal and administrative issues   pequiven was established in  to produce and commercialize petrochemical products in the domestic and international markets  pequiven is organized into business units focused on three production lines          olefins and derivative products          fertilizers and          industrial products   pequiven is party to  joint ventures with domestic and international business partners  most of the production facilities of these joint ventures are located at pequivens complexes  we estimate that the combined production capacity of these complexes is approximately eight million tons per year   pequiven operates three petrochemical complexes in venezuela          the zuliael tablazo complex in western venezuela which produces mainly olefins chlorine or caustic soda fertilizers industrial feedstocks and thermoplastic resins          the morón complex in central venezuela which produces fertilizers and sulfuric acid and             the jose complex in eastern venezuela which produces methanol fertilizers industrial products and methyl terbutylether mtbe   in addition to the three petrochemical complexes pequiven also has facilities to produce aromatics in the pdvsa el palito refinery located in the central north region of venezuela  the gross production of pequivens wholly owned plants and complexes in  and  was approximately  million metric tons and  million metric tons respectively  the gross production of pequivens joint ventures in  and  was approximately  million metric tons and  million metric tons respectively  products of these joint ventures include methanol mtbe polyethylenes polypropylenes ethylene oxide ethylene glycols caustic soda chlorine fertilizers caprolactam and other specialty products   pequivens goals are to increase the production of our petrochemical products and promote growth in this sector by increasing the sales of petrochemical products domestically  it is expected to achieve an annual combined production capacity of  million metric tons by  at pequivens plants and through pequivens joint ventures  pequiven also will continue to focus on improving competitiveness especially in the latin american market and profitability of the natural chemical and petrochemical sector   in this regard pequiven continuously explores new projects and joint ventures with third parties currently there are in discussions with potential partners regarding the development of the jose complex  to date pequivens joint ventures have allowed it to establish a significant and growing presence in regional and international markets  in  north america remained pequivens largest export destination followed by south america europe and asia and central america and the caribbean   the following table sets forth pequivens sales consolidated revenues net

subsidiaries which are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements   extraheavy crude oil   previously our subsidiary bitor was developing reserves of approximately  million of metric tons of extraheavy crude oil or approximately  million barrels principally through a process of emulsifying natural extraheavy crude oil in water to create an alternative liquid fuel to generate electricity which we refer to as orimulsion®  however pdvsa decided to apply most of these reserves to the production of commercial crude oil minimizing the production of orimulsion®  this new scheme is part of an effort to develop a financially balanced strategy for our natural extraheavy crude oil production   in december  bitor china national oil and gas exploration and development corporation and petrochina fuel oil company limited formed a joint venture called orifuels sinoven sa with the view to building and operating a production facility capable of producing up to  million metric tons by   orifuels sinoven sa is developing production facilities in two locations in venezuela morichal facilities were approximately  complete and the jose plant was approximately  complete by june       due to this new approach to the extraheavy crude oil business we have decided to call off all other production facilities development plans  we expect to complete the orifuels sinoven complex by october  and once it is operational this will be our exclusive orimulsion® manufacturing facility  from the production of this complex bitor will supply directly its orimulsion® supply agreements   our orimulsion® production capacity is currently  million metric tons per year or approximately  million barrels per year  our net production in  was approximately  million metric tons or  million barrels
