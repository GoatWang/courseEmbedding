biotherapeutics inc announced that phase ii trial results including new clinical data for alidornase alfa prx for the treatment of cystic fibrosis cf will be the subject of an oral presentation at the th european cystic fibrosis society conference in seville spain  alidornase alfa is a plant cellexpressed chemicallymodified recombinant dnase i enzyme resistant to inhibition by actin which the company has specifically designed to enhance the enzyme’s efficacy in cf patients the phase ii trial is a day switchover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alidornase alfa in cf patients previously treated with pulmozyme currently the only commercially available dnase i therapy for cf  participation in the trial was preceded by a twoweek washout period from pulmozyme before treatment with alidornase alfa via inhalation  sixteen patients were enrolled in the study all of whom completed the trial in accordance with the trial design each participating patient was tested at three major timepoints during the study for percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second or ppfev a key efficacy measure  the first ppfev test was performed at screening when the patient was still being treated with pulmozyme®  the second ppfev test was performed after the patient underwent a twoweek washout period from pulmozyme® but before first inhalation with alidornase alfa – the baseline – and the third ppfev test was performed at the end of the day study after the patient underwent daily inhalation treatments of alidornase alfa final analysis of the data demonstrated a mean absolute increase in ppfev of  points from baseline and an increase in ppfev of  points when compared to measurements taken from patients at enrollment before the switch from pulmozyme® to alidornase alfa in addition to the ppfev measurements taken during the study an additional ppfev measurement was taken two weeks after patients stopped treatment with alidornase alfa  for this measurement point a mean decrease in ppfev of  points was observed from the last alidornase alfa inhalation while patients taken off pulmozyme® at the beginning of the trial for two weeks experienced a mean decrease in ppfev of only  points for the same off treatment duration protalix bio therapeutics announces fda approval to operate current facility as multiproduct facility jun   protalix biotherapeutics inc

plant cell culture produced protein product taliglucerase alpha elelyso® was approved by the fda in may  for longterm enzyme replacement therapy ert for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type  gaucher disease   our focus protalix is dedicated to researching developing and marketing recombinant therapeutic proteins with clinically improved profiles produced by our procellex® plant cellbased protein expression platform our multidisciplinary scientific teams are focused on modifying biological properties of biotherapeutics aimed at improving clinical outcomes of therapies in areas of unmet need these capabilities are well demonstrated in protalix’s current pipeline   a proven alternative to mammalian cellbased production technology our platform is a proven alternative to the mammalian cellbased production technology the most common form of recombinant protein production overcoming many of its weaknesses while offering significant production regulatory and cost benefits as opposed to mammalian cells plant cells tolerate a relatively wide range of culturing conditions and naturally do not carry the risk of infection by human or animal pathogens this translates into lower capital investment in the set up as well as in ongoing maintenance of the production plant plant cells provide a natural barrier to human and animal pathogens and are able to utilize a simple culture medium with no requirement to any animal originated supplements this may prove to be important advantage from a regulatory perspective protalix’s procellex® platform uses flexible polyethylene disposable bioreactors designed and optimized for plant cell cultures as opposed to the large stainless steel reactors commonly used for recombinant protein production the procellex® bioreactors are easy to use entail low initial capital investment and can be scalable costeffectively additionally they require relatively low handson maintenance between cycles procellex® can potentially express certain proteins that are difficult to express in other systems through the procellex® system it is possible in certain cases to develop and commercialize recombinant proteins without infringing upon the methodbased patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties additionally the procellex® platform has the ability to more rapidly develop clinical material for testing versus other protein platforms     development of transgenic cell lines for production of target protein   orally delivered proteins a solution for oral delivery of proteins has been a long soughtafter aspiration of the biopharmaceutical industry orally delivered proteins provide more convenient drug administration than some of the current delivery options for proteins which include intravenous infusions and intramuscular and subcutaneous injections an oral delivery solution is expected to result in better patient compliance along with increased quality of life to date efforts have been met with very limited success due to the inability of proteins to survive the gastric environment of the digestive tract and to act only in the intestine there is a need for a safe noninvasive method for continuous delivery of protein therapeutics oral delivery of protein therapies produced through the procellex® platform can be made possible due to the unique cellulose wall of plant cells that makes them resistant to degradation when passing through the digestive tract the plant cell can serve as a natural vehicle for oral administration oprx is an oral antitumor necrosis factor antitnf candidate currently in a phase ii  clinical trial for inflammatory bowel diseases from concept to market we offer the following significant opportunities for the biopharmaceutical industry broad range of expression capabilities procellex® is able to produce a broad array of complex glycosylated proteins some of which are difficult to produce in mammalian bacterial and  and yeast cellbased systems significantly lower capital and production costs rapid scalable manufacturing based on requirements elimination of risk of mammalian viral transmission or infection biologic optimization

established pharmaceutical markets all of our pipeline candidates are proteins expressed via our proprietary procellex® system we are advancing clinical programs addressing fabry disease cystic fibrosis and immune and inflammatory diseases in addition protalix is conducting initial research to evaluate additional programs for developing proprietary proteins with improved clinical profiles exploiting the unique nature of plant cell expression pipeline overview pegunigalsidase alfa prx for the treatment of fabry disease about fabry disease fabry disease is an xlinked inherited disease that results from abnormal deposits of a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide in blood vessel walls throughout the body it occurs in one person per  patients with fabry disease inherit a deficiency of the enzyme alphagalactosidasea which is normally responsible for the breakdown of globotriaosylceramide the abnormal storage of globotriaosylceramide increases with time and so it accumulates primarily in the blood and in the blood vessel walls the channels of blood vessels narrow leading to decreased blood flow and decreased tissue nourishment the ultimate consequences of globotriaosylceramide deposition range from episodes of pain and impaired peripheral sensation to endorgan failure—particularly of the kidneys but also of the heart and cerebrovascular system fabry disease is generally treated by enzyme replacement therapy ert meaning replacing the missing alphagalactosidasea enzyme with a recombinant protein via intravenous infusion once every two weeks about pegunigalsidase alfa pegunigalsidase alfa is a plant cell culture expressed and a chemically modified version of the recombinant alphagalactosidasea protein protein subunits are covalently bound via chemical crosslinking using peg chains resulting in a more active and stable molecule than the current available versions prx  demonstrated enhanced circulatory halflife with higher enzyme activity in target organs affected by fabry disease protalix believes that this may potentially lead to a better clinical efficacy and an improved safety profile compared to currently available treatments see the latest presentation clinical data from phase iii study      days of active enzyme in clinical trials pegunigalsidase alfa has been shown to be active in the plasma for the entire two weeks between infusions this level of enzyme activity in the blood is substantially higher than that of currently available enzyme replacement therapies circulatory halflife pegunigalsidase alfa has demonstrated a halflife of approximately  hours it is a more stable molecule with a significantly longer circulatory halflife than the currently marketed enzyme replacement therapies positive impact on kidney function results of the phase iii study  with pegunigalsidase alfa showed a stability in egfr levels of the patients from baseline bl through  months and  months of treatment with the drug egfr estimated glomerular filtration rate measures level of kidney function and determines stage of kidney disease and function consistent egfr levels means that the kidney function does not deteriorate germaine et al  favorable safety and tolerability throughout the phase iii trial  infusions of pegunigalsidase alfa were administered this  amounts to approximately  patient years pegunigalsidase alfa was found to be  well tolerated with  of events being mild and moderate pegunigalsidase alfa demonstrated lower immunogenicity only three patients  tested positive for treatmentinduced antidrug antibodies lower immunogenicity means that the drug provokes a lower immune response as such patients may potentially experience less side effects fabrazyme prescribing information positive impact on cardiac function results of the phase iii study with pegunigalsidase alfa showed stability in key parameters relating to cardiac function meaningful reduction in pain results of the phase iii study showed that patients experienced less pain while being treated with pegunigalsidase alfa pivotal studies in  we have commenced two pivotal trials to support registration of pegunigalsidase alfa the balance study is a randomized double blind active control study of pegunigalsidase alfa prx compared to fabrazyme® in fabry patients previously treated with fabrazyme® the objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of pegunigalsidase alfa prx in renal function by comparison of the egfr slope mean annualized change between treatment groups the bridge study is an open label single arm switchover study to assess the efficacy and safety of pegunigalsidase alfa prx in fabry patients currently treated with replagal® alidornase alfa prx for the treatment of cystic fibrosis about cystic fibrosis cystic fibrosis cf is a lifethreatening genetic disease affecting the lungs and digestive system an estimated  children and adults worldwide have cf in patients with cf a defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce unusually thick sticky mucus that clogs the lungs this may lead to lung damage high exposure to lung infections and loss of respiratory function additionally the thickened mucus obstructs the pancreas and stops natural enzymes from helping the body break down food and absorb vital nutrients current therapies include multiple daily physiotherapy sessions to improve breathing various drug therapies as well as acute and preventive antibiotic therapy despite progress in understanding and treating cf it remains a challenge to significantly improve quality of life and prolong life prx alidornase alfa alidornase alfa prx is a proprietary plant cellexpressed recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease i dnase i that protalix has designed through chemical modification to be resistant to inhibition by actin dnase i is part of current cf therapy intended to reduce sputum viscosity that accumulates in the lungs of cf patients which exposes patients to recurrent infections and compromises lung function the current therapy is known as pulmozyme® dornase alfa given actin is a potent inhibitor of dnase i activity protalix’s alidornase alfa prx has the potential to enhance the enzyme’s efficacy significantly in cf patients when compared to the currently approved dnase treatment pulmozyme® however dnase i activity is compromised by actin a globular multifunctional protein found in high concentration in cf patients’ sputum which is a potent inhibitor of dnase i actin may decrease the enzyme’s dna degradation activity and potentially interfere with the effectiveness of inhaled dnase i in the lungs of cf patients in order to reduce the actindnase i interaction and the subsequent inhibition of dnase i activity by actin protalix developed alidornase alfa by chemically modifying the enzyme forming an actin inhibition resistant dnase i this novel treatment may result in an improved lung function and decreased incidence of recurrent infections in patients inhaled alidornase alfa prx was found safe in healthy volunteers protalix has begun a phase iia trial of alidornase alfa prx in cf patients following which protalix intends to actively seek collaboration with strategic partners for further development prx clinical data we have completed a phase i trial with  healthy volunteers alidornase alfa prx was found to be safe and tolerable in july  the first patient was dosed in protalix’s phase iia clinical trial of alidornase alfa prx  in january  protalix announced positive interim results from the phase ii clinical trial for the first  cf patients enrolled in the study at that time  patients had been enrolled in and were expected to complete the study the initial primary efficacy result shows that alidornase alfa prx improves lung function as demonstrated by a mean absolute increase in the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second ppfev of  points from baseline a commercially available small molecule cftr modulator for the treatment of cf has reported a mean absolute increase in ppfev of  from baseline in its registration clinical study this score was achieved while  of the patients participating in the trial of the cftr modulator were also treated with pulmozyme® on top of the modulator while this marketed cftr addresses a certain mutation applicable to less than  of cf patients alidornase alfa prx is being developed to treat all cf patients sputa available dna samples were analyzed for approximately half of the patients a mean reduction of approximately  in dna content from baseline was observed and a mean reduction of approximately  from baseline was observed for sputa viscoelasticity this data provides further supportive evidence of improved lung function after treatment with alidornase alfa prx as demonstrated by the increase in ppfev no serious adverse events were reported and all adverse events that occurred during the study were mild and transient in nature the phase ii trial is a day switchover study of  cf patients previously treated with pulmozyme® to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alidornase alfa prx in cf patients participation in the trial is preceded by a twoweek washout period from pulmozyme® before treatment with prx via inhalation   the main efficacy endpoint is the change of forced expiratory volume fev and forced vital capacity fvc  additional endpoints include safety and tolerability immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic data in the trial alidornase alfa prx is administered through philips respironics’ ineb aad inhaler system for which protalix has a supply agreement for the exclusive use of the device for the development of an inhaled product based on dornase alfa for the treatment of cf  the ineb aad is a small lightweight virtually silent device that is fully portable and has a unique vibrating mesh technology that allows for faster administration than conventional jet or ultrasonic nebulizers air dnase™ prx remains active in vitro assays have shown that that alidornase alfa prx remains active in the relevant concentrations of actin and alidornase alfa prx as opposed to pulmozyme® which loses activity reduction in mucus viscosity through rheological measurements in human sputa samples alidornase alfa prx  demonstrated a greater reduction in mucus viscosity compared to pulmozyme®  oprx for for the treatment of inflammatory diseases about autoimmunemediated disorders autoimmunemediated inflammatory disorders are conditions that are characterized by common pathways that lead to inflammation and are caused or triggered by a compromised or dysregulation of the normal immune response immunemediated inflammatory disorders can cause organ damage and are associated with increased morbidity common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease psoriasis and others some of the major treatments are antitumor necrosis factor antitnf drugs administered as subcutaneous injections or as intravenous infusions sales of antitnf drugs exceeded  billion annually about oprx oprx is a plant cellexpressed recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor ii fused to an igg fc domain tnfriifc in development for oral administration when administered orally and while passing through the digestive tract the plant cells function as a natural delivery vehicle having the unique attribute of a cellulose cell wall which makes them resistant to degradation compared to proteins produced via mammalian cell expression preclinical data and clinical studies in november  the first patient was enrolled in protalix’s phase ii clinical trial of oprx for the treatment of ulcerative colitis oprx is a plant cellexpressed recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor ii fused to an igg fc domain tnfriifc the phase ii clinical trial is a randomized open label arm study of oprx in  patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis patients will be randomized to receive  mg or  mg of oprx administered orally once daily for  weeks the primary endpoint of the study is safety including monitoring for adverse events following daily administration of the drug key efficacy endpoints include relevant disease parameters of the drug including mayo score and rectal bleeding if successful oprx will be the first ever oral enzyme treatment as currently there are no other oral enzyme treatments available in august  we announced positive clinical study results from our phase i clinical trial of oprx prx demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile and biological activity in the gut the phase i clinical trial was a randomized paralleldesign openlabel study designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of prx in healthy volunteers the trial enrolled  subjects that were randomized to one of three dosing cohorts receiving prx doses equivalent to mg mg or mg tumor necrosis factor receptorfc fusion protein subjects received once daily oral administrations for five consecutive days the results demonstrated that oral administration of prx is safe and well tolerated no major side effects were noted and no suppression of the immune system was observed regulatory t cell activation showing biological activity in the gut was observed fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis facs was performed using various antibodies for surface markers and it was observed that all three dosages of prx promoted the induction of various subsets of t cells some of which are correlated with antiinflammatory response the efficacy of oprx was shown in preclinical studies using mouse models of immunemediated diseases such as ibd inflammatory bowel diseases and immunemediated hepatitis results showed that prx has the potential to positively affect these diseases displaying changes in symptoms and in serum levels of antiinflammatory markers   inflamatory disease animal model oral antitumor necrosis factor alpha anti tnf α oprx  for  inflammatory diseases potential to locally deliver higher doses with fewer side effects in an oral formulation  collaborations protalix is leveraging internally developed capabilities to improve biologic dynamics eg glycosylation halflife extension of a protein combined with the multiple unique advantages of its proprietary procellex® protein expression system including advanced genetic engineering technology and plant cellbased protein expression methods to develop a pipeline of novel nextgeneration or clinically superior versions of recombinant therapeutic proteins significant advantages of procellex® over existing expression systems of mammalian bacterial yeast and transgenic cellbased expression technologies include biologic optimization the ability to penetrate certain patentprotected markets a broad range of expression capabilities significantly lower capital and production costs elimination of the risk of viral transmission or infection by mammalian components and the potential ability to administer active therapeutic proteins and vaccines orally we believe that all these elements along with our success in bringing elelyso® taliglucerase alfa for injection through clinical trials regulatory agency approval and into the market demonstrates a full set of capabilities which make protalix a partner of choice for other complex therapeutic proteins protalix is interested in considering partnership opportunities on biobetter and novel therapeutic proteins and vaccines as well as exploring oral delivery of biotherapeutics and vaccines by utilizing procellex® technology in addition to collaborations relating to protalix’s current pipeline of proprietary
