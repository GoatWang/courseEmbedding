possibilities were good following the countrys unprecedented prosperity and world influence after ww ii the s were marked by emerging violence and discontentthe watts riots brutal political killingsthe fearsome responses to shattered hopes farber sketches an arresting picture of a national midlife crisis recorded and disseminated in part by an infectious tv culture that for the first time provided the majority of americans with their news and hit an unlikely nerve with the ever popular story of a poor family making good the beverly hillbillies  beatniks beatles timothy leary and marijuana busts shared prime time with vietnam mario salvios free speech movement black power and the landmark civil rights act lyndon johnson reportedly said to segregationist sen richard russell get out of my way im going to run over you the great dreams of the s like johnsons great society collided with the explosive realities with deft overview farber explores the many intertwined movements including kennedys strident anticommunist election campaign that later contributed to his committing combat troops in vietnam although the complex arts and letters get short shrift in favor of pop culture and a sense of pastiche is inevitable readers who lived through the sor wish they didwill relish this work copyright  reed business information inc read more from library journal in this reasoned and readable survey of the momentous social and political events of the s historian farber sympathetically looks at this period without rosecolored glasses critically analyzing it without assigning blame he treats the decade as a critical period of changeof creativity and chaosthat grew out of an increasingly consumeroriented postworld war ii society reaching out to absorb all americans the civil rights revolution the vietnam war the urban riots the rise of rock music the decades rise and fall of the great society and the assassinations are all woven together masterfully in a historical narrative that successfully communicates the eras zeitgeist especially interesting is farbers final chapter explaning how the s and the beginning of the reagan era evolved from the burnedout fragments of the s a synthesis of late thcentury american political and social history against which future books on the decade will be measured jack forman mesa coll lib san diegocopyright

university of chicago press copyright copy  david r farber all right reserved isbn    sloans work selfforgetfulness is what is required early twentiethcentury engineer on being a corporate employee being a child held little interest for alfred sloan even before his youth had ended he strained to begin his work the eldest of ﬁve children sloan was born in new haven connecticut on may   his father alfred p sloan sr was then twentyﬁve his mother twentythree they were originally from upstate new york where their respective families were old and respectable but not welltodo mrs sloans father had been a methodist episcopal minister the sloans but not their eldest son maintained a close association with the denomination until their deaths sloan srs father had been a private school master but when his father sickened alfred sr was forced to leave school early and make his way in the world this he did by the time alfred jr was born his father was already a successful merchant purveying tea cigars and coffee primarily he imported coffee beans which he roasted ground and blended and then sold them wholesale by the time young alfred was eleven years of age bennett sloan and company was a twostory concern located at  hudson street in lower manhattan the success of the business founded in new haven had brought sloan sr and his partner to new york city in  the company prospered and sloan grew up in a large brownstone at  garﬁeld place in a relatively fashionable part of brooklyn soon after moving to brooklyn alfred began attending the brooklyn polytechnic institute which educated boys in what was then called mechanics or the practical sciences much to young alfreds delight he was an outstanding student who relished book learning most of the boys in his neighborhood spent their afternoons out on the streets teasing the icemans horse or playing ball ﬂipping on and off wagons or hustling nickels sellingnewspapers in  twothirds of newspapers were sold by newsboysand a few newsgirls as wellin the late afternoon in his own accounts of his youth sloan states that he went straight home from school and spent his afterschool hours avidly working through his text books while sloan would never display any nostalgic interest in his brooklyn youthor ever mention any particular feelings he may have had about moving from new haven to new yorkhe did retain throughout his life a distinct brooklyn accent which others often found surprising on ﬁrst hearing he had a somewhat reedy tenor voice and his speech was marked with such brooklynese as foist for ﬁrst and woik for work since neither of his parents were brooklyn natives the heaviness of sloans accent suggests that he spent more time than he later admitted outside his home playing with other children and exploring his neighborhood in the only published photograph from alfred sloans boyhood he sits astride a highwheel bicycle probably an  columbia light roadster sloan in later life always carefully crafted his selfimage for public consumption and it is likely that he provided the photo himself ﬁrst published in a  fortune magazine proﬁle to reveal his early interest in the wheeled technology that directly contributed to his own industrial career the photo was captioned young alfred astride the mechanical marvel of his age had already chosen his career whatever sloans intent the photo of a cocksure boy high atop his spectacular bicycleif it was a columbia bicycle it cost upwards of  at a time when the us per capita income was under reveals that he was never as onedimensional a ﬁgure as his own accounts even of his boyhood always suggested whether or not alfred was a more playful child than he later wished others to know by the time he was a teenager he was clearly eager to move forward and put childhood behind him sloan had decided that he wanted to be an engineer a profession of relatively recent vintage at age seventeen he attempted to enroll at the columbia university school of mines despite easily passing the entrance exams he was told he was too young to matriculate probably after some independent investigation he turned to the more distant massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge which saw his age as no impediment his father had the money to send sloan to mit and support him there in  the year before sloan matriculated at mit and only thirty years after the schools establishment the institutes president francis amasa walker had told his fellow educators that in the schools of applied science and technology is to be found the perfection of education for young men sloan wanted just such an education he expected the work to be difﬁcult and he intended to devote himself to it with a singular dedication further he decided early on that he would compound the challenge of mits program of studies by completing the fouryear program in three years sloan saw his university days as a training ground for professional activities not as some adventure in selfdiscovery or youthful pleasures as sloan remembered almost a half a century later i had been a grind i had worked every possible minute so that i might be graduated a year ahead with the class of  sloan succeeded he graduated from arguably the ﬁnest technology program in the nation in just three years he had led his class in calculus receiving a perfect score of  in his freshman year he had also excelled in thermodynamics in which he received a near perfect semester average of  not all went so well for sloan during his mit days in his courses in literature and history which the school required he did far worse receiving three ds and two cs many decades later sloan forgot or more likely chose to ignore at least temporarily that he had ever taken such frustrating courses he told an associate when i went to mit i did not have a single course in english to say nothing of a single course in literature i did not have a course in economics or in sociology or in history to say nothing of broader courses than that sloan concluded i had a very narrow technical education   for that reason and probably for inherent reasons i am a very narrow man mits president in the s francis amasa walker would have been disappointed with sloans harsh selfassessment and of his recollection of what courses he had actually taken president walker had hoped that requiring humanities courses with their liberalizing tendencies would combine with the work of the sciences in making the pupils exact and strong undoubtedly sloan believed he had achieved exactitude in his studies and even a certain kind of mental strength cultural interests however did not stem naturally from his exposure to them to go for the moment far ahead in this unfolding story throughout his long life alfred sloan nearly never read for pleasure or voluntarily attended cultural performances of any kind the mit curriculum whatever sloan chose to remember or say in retrospect was not to blame for this antipathy to works of literature or the creative arts sloan received a bachelor of science in electricity a ﬁeld of study added to the curriculum at mit only in  but which was by the mids the most popular major at the school electrical engineering was then still in its infancy sloan worked on equipment donated by thomas edison just before his arrival like edison sloan did not see himself as a lone genius preparing for a lifetime of creative breakthroughs he would be a scientiﬁcally trained technical problem solver prepared for coordinated work on practical concerns alfred sloan had become an electrical engineer like most of his cohort to take a corporate position in americas worldleading industrial sector the mit classes of the s were memorable ones by the early s institute alumni ran general motors general electric goodyear and du pont the engineering minddisciplined logical and methodicalﬁt perfectly the needs of americas evolving business corporations when he graduated in  sloan expected that his training would afford him the opportunity to take a respectable place in an industrial enterprise at the end of the nineteenth century in the united states as elsewhere in the world that mattered to alfred sloan it was in industry that opportunity for achievement lay a position within an industrial enterprise he believed would allow him to demonstrate his abilities make his way and advance rapidly the meaning and nature of that success were subjects about which sloan made no internal queries his mind at least as he and others have revealed it did not turn in those sorts of direction sloan just twenty years of age when he left mit was already a man of some certainties the great depression the era that will ﬁgure so centrally in this story could not have been a huge shock to alfred sloan jr he had been born just after the horrendous panic of  and when he graduated from mit in  the american economy was still reeling from the  depression the worst the nation had yet suffered as the economy contracted in  some six hundred banks and more than ﬁfteen thousand businesses dissolved farmers were hit especially hard and for the ﬁrst time in the nations history tens of thousands of tramps most of them farm laborers wandered the countryside in search of food in the urban industrial centers employers had to let go as many as one quarter of all unskilled industrial workers sloan followed the effects of the struggling economy in the boston newspapers he knew and almost certainly disapproved of william jennings bryants inﬂationary demands for the coinage of silver to increase the money supply and so ease farmers perilous economic plight and he read with interest the daily press reports tracking the progress of the socalled coxeys army of unemployed men which made its way by rail and road to washington dc to wage the ﬁrst national political campaign against unemployment in  about ten thousand of the unemployed most of them in small groups from the far northwest california new england the middle west and the rocky mountain states marched on the nations capital to present a petition in boots they wanted congress to provide a national public works program until private employment again became possible the largest group perhaps a thousand men called themselves coxeys army after their radical leader jacob coxey a successful ohio businessman who insisted that a humanitarian concern for the less fortunate and the new industrial order could be reconciled through government action the marchers succeeded in capturing the nations interest but received no hearing from congress coxey was jailed for twenty days for illegally carrying banners and for walking on the grass in the mids the federal government provided the general citizenry with less than  million a year for all social welfare health and security programs the business cycle while little analyzed was understood by most men of the capitalist class to be an unfortunate but regular part of the workings of the modern economy for sloan this downward turn was not merely a story in the newspapers he could not ﬁnd a job he spent a few months after his graduation working with one of his professors on engineering projects but nothing developed from it when he began looking in earnest for a regular position in late  alfred sloan who had graduated mit in three years was turned down by every employer he contacted many industrial ﬁrms still distrusted universityeducated menfew of the older generation of industrialists had received a higher educationand engineering positions of any kind following the  downturn were in short supply in sloans understated way he once allowed that the year after he graduated college was an unhappy time for him the most discouraging point of my whole life he was forced to look inward and ask himself where did i ﬁt into the american economy what could i do sloan remember was only twenty years old when he ﬁnished with mit the youngest member of his graduating class forced leisure did not however encourage in him some desire to travel or to pursue adventure like most young professional men of his time he had no interest in fostering his personality through some course of selfdiscovery such emphasis on the rewards of personal development would not become commonplace for another quarter of a century sloan wished only to ﬁnd opportunity for the talent and training he had developed at mit a favorite adage like many american businessmenfrom benjamin franklin through the present daysloan did produce and adhere to certain adages expressed his outlook and goal everyone of us has a certain talent in a certain direction and in other directions we may be completely devoid of talent it is essential he would say to ﬁgure out your talent for that way work becomes a pleasure and not a drudgery that sloan would simply assume that any talent worthy of being so described would be workdirected indicates a fundamental aspect of his social outlook sloans talent so well proven at mit was in mastering and even exceeding the demands of institutional structures sloan needed a position a place in an organization from which he could direct his immense capacity for focused work in problem solving without such an organization he was without purpose in another rare allowance of personal feeling sloan would note as i was naturally of a serious turn of mind i suppose i was more than ordinarily troubled when i failed to ﬁnd work at any of the places where i applied no evidence exists suggesting that sloans inability to ﬁnd a position despite his superior qualiﬁcations during a time of market contraction caused him to regard the free enterprise system with any disfavor in the account of his employment troubles just quoted which was written at the end of the great depression sloan managed to interject the ﬁrstperson pronoun ﬁve times in one sentence to make it clear that he blames no one and nothing for his difﬁculties except himself emphasizing i failed to ﬁnd work whether or not sloan accurately recalls what he felt at the time he does admit to being deeply depressed in late  the damaged economy thwarted him and he did not know what to do after some months of this unhappiness his father ﬁnally was able to help sloan sr was well acquainted with one of brooklyns richest men john e searles of the american sugar reﬁning company their friendship extended back to the beginnings of their respective business pursuits in new haven and had been renewed at the methodist episcopal church in brooklyn where both men played an active role searles agreed to meet sloans son and see what he could do for him the meeting was brief sloan was shy at ﬁrst as was his nature but was soon put at ease by searles kind and courteous demeanor searles whose business made him an experienced judge of character and ability recognized what youngalfred had to offer sloan left the meeting with a position in one of searles smaller companies his career was launched sloan never in later years pretended his entrance into the business world to be anything other than it was he was of a new breed he was born not into great wealth nor was he a selfmade man his was no horatio alger story sloan would later use the term algerboy to refer to the selfmade he came from a respectable uppermiddleclass white anglosaxon protestant family his fathers connections coupled to his excellent education and obvious talent proved out over time sloans hardest problem ﬁnding out where he ﬁt into the american economy had been solved and his timein retrospect a very brief timeof great disappointment had come to a close sloans career did not at ﬁrst seem to be on a meteoric course the position that searles had provided for him was the relatively humble post of draftsman young alfred probably did not mention to searles that the worst grade he had received at mitan fhad been in drawing sloan was employed at a small factory the hyatt roller bearing company a ﬂedgling company in which searles had the major interest hyatt was itself a humble concern which moved from gritty newark to the even less glamorous harrison new jersey shortly after sloan began work its operations were composed of a single building a dirty shacklike structure its nearest neighbor was a sprawling junkyard ﬁlled with rusting obsolete machinery indicative of its status hyatt was sited on low ground so that when it rained the unpaved grounds surrounding the factory became a sea of mud hyatt manufactured a new sort of antifriction roller bearing this bearing served to increase energy efﬁciency and thus decrease energy expenditures by reducing the frictional pressures on the line shafting that still turned most of the industrial machines then in use in the united states this being just prior to the use of electric motors in such machinery one can still view how industrial machinery was turned by line shafting at the textile factories preserved as museums in the old mill towns of lowell and lawrence massachusetts the bearing had been ﬁrst used in searles sugar grinders the hyatt roller bearing had been invented by john wesley hyatt an oldschool inventor largely selftaught and unsophisticated in scientiﬁc methods and theory despite his formal shortcomings hyatt was one of the most productive independent inventors of the nineteenth century his breakthrough had come in  when a shortage of elephant tusks had induced a new york city billiard ball manufacturer to offer a prize of ten thousand dollars for a synthetic billiard ball hyatt had combined pyroxylin a volatile nitrocellulose substance with camphor to make his plastine ball in a small shop hyatt churned out other ingenious materials including a much improved hardened wood for golf club heads the roller bearing that bore its inventors name developed from the same lathe that hyatt had invented to produce the synthetic billiard balls had a decided advantage over competitive products for one simple reason it was made of coiled steel tubing that gave it a springy quality and thus as sloan wrote some years later yielded to irregularities caused by poor manufacture thus making automatic adjustments between housing and bearing it is worth emphasizing given sloans subsequent career that the hyatt bearing was needed because machined parts in the late nineteenth century had not yet as a matter of course been engineered to ﬁne tolerances as a result the ﬂexibility of the hyatt roller bearing made it an excellent product for the time but as sloan understood almost immediately despite his lowly position and youth the company was poorly run and so incapable of capitalizing its opportunities at best the company with its twentyﬁve or so employees was averaging two thousand dollars a month in sales sloan was paid ﬁfty dollars monthly and he quickly observed that the payroll was quite often being met only because mr searles subsidized it the business was a money loser sloan became friendly with the companys young bookkeeper a norwegian immigrant named peter steenstrup over lunches at the nearest eatery they discussed the means by which hyatt could be made into a proﬁtable business the talk was idle as no one in authority had the least interest in their viewpoint sloan was frustrated his talents were being wasted and he was impatient to move forward in the world he desired to be married to a women he had been courting since his days at mit irene jackson of roxbury massachusetts although where he found the time to meet and then court miss jackson remains a great mystery given his work habits both in college and on the job in sloans mind marriage was impossible until he had achieved a more respectable economic status in  sloan left hyatt in a rare but not unique move he took a gamble on an unproven invention an electric refrigeration unit being developed by lieutenant michael e wood of the us navy wood no longer a young man was an inveterate inventor trained some years earlier at the naval academy one of the nations ﬁrst institutions to professionally educate engineers he was sure he had ﬁnally come up with a winning technology and his enthusiasm was contagious wood had started a company to manufacture and install his refrigeration units in large apartment houses and hotels as he explained to sloan the main refrigeration machinery would be located in a buildings basement cold brine would then be pumped to individual boxes lined with copper coils that in turn would chill the boxs contents and incredibly also supply icycold running water a rich bostonian had provided the startup capital sloan was charged with designing the systems circulating system and with managing sales that the shy sloan completely unsuited to backslapping and gladhanding had been given salesman duties indicates how shaky were the enterprises foundations wood called his brainchild the hygienic refrigeration company as sloan recalled many years later i was a kid infected with lieutenant woods blind faith sloan was just twentytwo years old from his experiences with the hygienic refrigeration company he would learn to trust even more in his dispassionate nature like so many other new technologybased companies then and now the business was not a success many were interested in the idea but the system was quite expensive worse it frequently broke down even so sloan threw himself into the work the enterprise was exciting demanding of his talents and provided at ﬁrst a good income based on his faulty expectations of a reasonable economic future with hygienic sloan married irene jackson on september   we do not know if the couple were giddy with love or as sober in private as they always appeared in their relatively rare public appearances in later years separated as they were for nearly three years one assumes they corresponded and perhaps they phoned one another despite the cost and the relatively poor quality of long distance transmissions no record exists images of the courting sloan the young man in love died with him all that remains of the sloans from their ﬁrst year of marriage is a single photograph made sometime during the spring or early summer of  like so much else that sloan left for others to ponder it is a conventionalized image the newlyweds are pictured with alfreds family alfred sr is at the center of the family arrangement holding his youngest child raymond in his lap he maintains the six year olds attention with a picture book alfred jr sits at his fathers right hand looking quite composed in a canebacked rocking chair he stares as was his way all through life with a ﬁxed unemotional gaze at the cameraa typical pose for a young man of his status at the end of the nineteenth century the cameras slow shutter speed contributed to such stifflooking poses the only person standing in the family photo is irene she is all in white positioned behind her husband her arm on his chair but not touching him perhaps it is a not the best picture of her she appears to have a very long nose on a small face her dark hair is neatly tied behind her head in a bun like her motherinlaw she hints at a smile we know at the very least that sloan did love his bride at least in his own reserved way in the same year of her death in  sloan would break down before the man warren weaver he wished to appoint to the presidency of the sloan foundation weaver had just told sloan that he would seriously consider the presidency of the foundation but only if he not be asked to make extensive business travels he explained that in his previous position with the rockefeller foundation he had been forced to spend too much time away from his wife the eightyoneyearold sloan responded if i ever ask you to do anything that limits your companionship with your wife you just tell me to go to hell i understand completely for many years i was too completely absorbed in my business i always said that i would cut down on this and spend more time with my wife but warren i waited too long at this point sloan a man who aside from the perfunctory and brief handshake almost never physically touched anyone at least in public put his arm across weavers shoulders as tears rolled down his cheeks sloan undoubtedly loved irene even if he chose not to show that affection publicly and rarely found the time to demonstrate it privately sloan would remain married to irene jackson sloan for the next ﬁftyeight years according to one lateinlife acquaintance mr and mrs sloan wished to have children but they were unable to do so whether they considered adopting a son or a daughter is unknown no child would ever be theirs sloans longlife would not be colored by children or childish ways though sloan did have a great affection for his youngest brother raymond his junior by eighteen years family life as a rule did not much touch the inner life or daily routine of alfred sloan though the available evidence indicates that he believed himself to be in love with his wife even that union as sloan confessed had little impact on his devotion to his work commitments in  sloan dedicated his publicity driven autobiography in which his personal life ﬁgures almost not at all to ijs my partner in the enterprise it was for sloan a rare touch of the ironic that only highlighted the obviousirene had nothing at all to do with the enterprise that consumed sloans time and energies for sloan work would always come ﬁrst soon after his marriage the hygienic refrigeration company dissolved wood had died sloan by this time less than pleased with the companys founding genius seems not to have been moved by his demise luckily even as the refrigeration enterprise went under an opportunity had arisen john searles the man who had given sloan his start was fed up with the hyatt roller bearing company facing some personal ﬁnancial difﬁcultieshe was soon to go broke not unusual for backers of new technologieshe wished to sell the moneylosing enterprise at the younger alfreds urging alfred sloan sr and an associate agreed to buy searles out for ﬁve thousand dollars sloan sr further agreed to supply capital at least for a period of six months until the business was proﬁtable he clearly made this investment for his son just twentythree years old alfred sloan jr was put in charge of the hyatt roller bearing company over time he would accumulate a large equity interest in the business his righthand man was peter steenstrup the lunchtime discussions the two had enjoyed little more than a year earlier were to be put to the test within six months the company was turned around while steenstrup relentlessly pursued new sales opportunities sloan completely reorganized production to achieve far greater cost efﬁciency and product reliability sloan spent the ﬁrst four years working at least ten hours a day six days a week week after week after week he took no vacations for the next eighteen years sloan ran the company under his direction hyatt became an extraordinary success quickly outgrowing its one shacklike building to become an expansive modern industrial complex this success was due to sloans correct assessment that hyatt should direct its efforts toward integrating its products with the nascent auto industry the auto industry at the end of the nineteenth century was pure ﬂux and partial whimsy it was hundreds of men tinkering in barns garages and dirtﬂoored machine shops carriage makers buggy builders bicycle mechanics wagon wheel manufacturers machine parts makers and an exotic melange of undercapitalized entrepreneurs wrestled with the possibilities of manufacturing an automobile a selfpropelled vehicle a machine that moved itself under the control of its human operator it was a time of technological and cultural free play in which a machine and basic ways of living working playing and courting were on the verge of being integrated in unanticipated ways in terms of its sociohistorical development the united states had entered a liminal zone a threshold between two cultural landscapes the english language itselfwith much borrowing from the french chassis limousine garage chauffeur automobilewould have to be squeezed and reshaped in order to build a vocabulary that could incorporate the construction of a way of being in the worldriding in an autoanticipated by other modes of transport but fully realized by none other given the right kind of imagination it was a fantastic historic moment in the year  few in the united states envisioned a mass market for the gasolinepowered road car only about ﬁfteen hundred such cars were produced that year whereas manhattan alone had over  horses working the streets or put another way more than ten times as many horses died in new york city as there were new autos with internal combustion engines built in the entire country wealthy sports most of them urbanites drove the tiny automobile market though increasingly rural doctors were buying cars as well the highpriced machines were amusingly if at times painfully unreliable still an aura surrounded this technological phenomena the aura glistened green money possibly a great deal of money could be made in this new world few of course saw this opportunity horse manure still seemed a more likely growth industry one more equine fact to ponder new york city horses excreted roughly one million pounds of manure a day as a result the industry for the most part was not developed by major corporations which generally were unwilling to take on the high risks associated with technological experimentation unrelated to their ongoing businesses instead auto enthusiasts smalltime investors and a mixed bagof mechanically gifted men willing to gamble in exchange for the main chance struggled to make automobiles scores of workshops and small companies hammered out the parts and accessories that would be painstakingly assembled into a working vehicle by dozens of competing automakers each of whom fought off creditors and cash ﬂow problems in the furious rush to manufacture a breakthrough machine sloan did not in a leap of imagination picture the possibilities created by the smalltime automakers he was approached by them at least that is how sloan in his selfdeprecating manner tells the story though he alludes to the fact that he and his associate mr steenstrup were aggressively looking for new markets for their product they knew that roller bearings for machine line shafting due to the increasingly common use of electric engines were about to become technologically obsolete hyatt bearings or at least some manufacturers bearings were needed by the automakers to make car wheels turn efﬁciently on their axles hyatt was ﬁrst approached about supplying auto wheel bearings in  by elwood haynes producer of haynes apperson cars in kokomo indiana haynes as sloan described him some years later was the quintessential rube sophisticated about nothing but the possibilities of the automobile sloan also seems to have found it quite amusing that haynes and his nascent auto works was based in the booming alliterative metropolis of kokomo indiana in fact haynes was an extraordinarily accomplished american engineer with degrees from both worcester polytechnic institute and johns hopkins university who had mastered german in order to follow the pathbreaking automotive work of gottfried daimler and karl benz sloan was a new yorker and despite hayness ﬁrstrate east coast education technical training linguistic gifts and proven talents the kokomobased haynes might well have appeared to sloan as a provincial yokel or more likely in his postnew deal  description of haynes and the advent of the auto industry sloan aimed to make a point about the lowcost entry freemarket creativity at work in those ﬁrst days of the auto business while sloan himself would soon enough do his best to ensure that the auto industry itself would become a very highcost entry business he took pains in his own account of his early years to tell his tale of elwood haynes of kokomo and other rather simple people to convince the democratic citizenry that the free market enables economic creativity in the most unexpected places by the most unexpected people it was alfred p sloans ﬁrm belief one which he wanted all americans to fully appreciate that no government planner could ever anticipate the vitality of individual americans free to pursue their dreams of proﬁtable accomplishment of course such thoughts were in the early years of the twentieth century not yet in sloans ken it would take the political turmoil of the s to turn his mind in such an unwelcome direction in the ﬁrst years of the automobile age sloan and his hyatt associate peter steenstrup became industry ﬁxtures steenstrup was the ﬁeld man he visited every manufacturer and set up shop at every trade show steenstrups mission was simple but as any sales representative knows not easy his responsibility was to identify and to win the trust of the many men in the highly volatile auto business who had the responsibility for buying parts for their companys machines steenstrup had to be the hailfellowwellmet who got hyatt in the door sloan then would ﬁgure out how to design hyatt bearings into the auto manufacturers assemblage through trade show excursions and factory visits sloan too met most everyone of signiﬁcance in the auto industry in his own recollections of those early days in the auto parts business sloan credited many individuals with providing him with lifelong business lessons one of the ﬁrst and most important of these lessons came from henry leland general manager of cadillac then an independent automaker sloan received this lesson ﬁrsthand after leland rejected the ﬁrst shipment of bearings hyatt had sent cadillac the contract was vitally important to hyatts shortterm proﬁtability and even more essential to the companys reputation for reliability in the infant auto industry sloan rushed by train from new york to detroit in an attempt to salvage the contract in his ofﬁce leland a large bearded gentleman of old testament rages showed sloan the facts bearings in hand and his anger still on call leland demonstrated that the hyatt product despite salesman steenstrups assurances did not meet cadillacs required parameters accuracy within a thousandth of an inch sloan though speaking as softly as he could did at ﬁrst attempt to explain away the difﬁculty after leland angrily interrupted him however sloan stopped defending his company and listened leland explained the necessity of manufacturing precisely engineered interchangeable parts mr sloan he roared cadillacs are made to run not just to sell sloan understood he agreed he asked lelands advice from then on he would do better i was determined to be as fanatical as he in obtaining precision in our work an entirely different standard had been established for hyatt roller bearings one of sloans many strengths was his ability to hear others out dispassionately if the facts as he understood them bore out he could and did shift his perspective given his later political difﬁculties it is worth emphasizing the other side of this character trait if sloan did not believe the facts bore out or if facts as he perceived them were not being given their due sloan could become quite recalcitrant and even emotionally explosive such times were rare leland spoke in a language sloan understood and sloans postgraduate work in manufacturing advanced signiﬁcantly as a result one other character trait worth noting is revealed in the leland anecdote sloan as both a young man and a man of middle age was skilled at working with men older than himself as well as with men of his own generation this ability was amply demonstrated in his ﬁrst years with hyatt when he had sought out old john wesley hyatt in his inventors shop and plied him with questions about roller ball bearings leland too was a man of an altogether different generation and set of experiences including leland believed a personal visitation from god but sloan developed a strong working relationship with him leland was an engineer of the old school of practical experience he had received his start as a toolmaker for a federal arsenal during the civil war in sloans eyes however leland was always an elder not only in age but in engineering wisdom sloan had a gift that is rare in young men the ability to learn from ones elders and to seek their counsel in establishing such relations sloan also bore out an old organizational adage to the effect that seeking help and counsel from those one admires generally brings support and concern from the sought after for the seeker for sloan later in his life a major problem would be the lack of anyone from whom he felt he could learn in the world he respected few people seemed to be his equal let alone his superior he would retain his gift for listening to the facts and admitting his own mistaken viewpoints but what he lost was his ability to rethink fundamentals based on advice or instruction from others sloan was a regular at the yearly auto shows which began in  ﬁve in fact were held that year all claiming to be the ﬁrst by the  auto show hyatt passed out brochures advertising the hyatt improved self oiling self contained bearing with removable inside and outside casings sloan wrote the copy for the brochure which reveals something of the state of advertising in the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century as well as of the directions sloans talents did and did not point the prospective purchaser of a motor car must be satisﬁed upon three vital points before he can possibly be induced to invest   the car must have all the power that is required it must be built so that it may easily be taken care of and it must be constructed in such a manner that the driver may be reasonably sure of getting back home any humor found in this ad is wholly the work of the reader not the writer of the copy during the auto shows steenstrup would rope in the multitudes of car enthusiasts master auto mechanics and pioneering adventurers in the motor business and herd them over to the hyatt booth sloan waited for them there henry ford and alfred sloan ﬁrst met at the hyatt booth probably in  when ford was working on the racing car that would soon thereafter bring him his ﬁrst fame ford and sloan we only know watched together from the gallery of madison square garden as the earliest american auto manufacturers ran their carsoften oneofakind modelsaround a track set up on the ﬂoor of the hall continues
