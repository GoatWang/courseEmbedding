mention that applying oilbased products to polyurethane can make items oily and even slippery can scotts liquid gold be used to remove wax buildup scotts liquid gold wood care will remove light wax buildups when applied to previously waxed furniture the wax will soften leaving a smeary cloudy surface apply scotts liquid gold liberally and let stand for several hours before wiping dry turn cloth repeatedly to avoid spreading the softened wax this process may need to be repeated several times before all of the old waxes are completely removed when finished the surface should look clean and feel slightly oily once the wax has been completely removed scotts liquid gold will penetrate the wood to restore lost moisture note if white circles develop you may need to refinish the wood this occurs when products containing silicone were previously used for faster results on extremely heavy wax buildups use a commercial grade wax remover or talk with a wood professional about doing the job
