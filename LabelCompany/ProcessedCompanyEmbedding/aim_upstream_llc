upstream and downstream in the production process by brian bass commercial shipping or receiving of goods globally involves international logistics ryan mcvayphotodiscgetty images related articles  push vs pull supply chain strategy  upstream and downstream activities for a marketing director  what are the four elements of supply chain management  difference between tier   tier  companies upstream and downstream are business terms applicable to the production processes that exist within several industries industries that commonly use this terminology include the metals industry oil gas biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries upstream downstream and midstream make up the stages of the production process for these and other industries definition of upstream the upstream stage of the production process involves searching for and extracting raw materials the upstream part of the production process does not do anything with the material itself such as processing the material this part of the process simply finds and extracts the raw material thus any industry that relies on the extraction of raw materials commonly has an upstream stage in its production process in a more general sense upstream can also refer to any part of the production process relating to the extraction stages examples of upstream processes in the petroleum industry locating underground or underwater oil reserves characterizes the upstream process additionally the upstream process in this industry involves bringing oil and gas to the surface extraction wells represent an example of a structure operating in this stage in the process the upstream stage in the production process may also manifest itself as a supplier providing raw materials to manufacturers or other businesses that ultimately process the materials definition of downstream the downstream stage in the production process involves processing the materials collected during the upstream stage into a finished product the downstream stage further includes the actual sale of that product to other businesses governments or private individuals the type of end user will vary depending on the finished product regardless of the industry involved the downstream process has direct contact with customers through the finished product examples of downstream processes in the oil and gas industry the downstream process consists of converting crude oil into other products and then selling those products to customers thus oil refineries represent structures that operate within the downstream process however any kind of plant that processes raw materials may qualify as operating within the downstream stage of production a company that combines both upstream and downstream processes is an integrated company

hawkins services technology evaluation  selection real estate multiple listing services  association product management surveysresearch sales advisory marketing strategic planning wav group communications waves of change reports blog newsletter event calendar contact our customers project upstream revealed by victor lund on may   for a few years now industry leaders have been working together to address data problems producing almost two years ago a solution concept called “upstream” not long after that the wav group was asked to consult on the technical side of the development of the project our nondisclosure agreement has prevented us from saying much about it however now we are very pleased to be allowed finally to share some information about the concept in an announcement this week upstreamre llc the standalone company that will direct the effort announced that it is deep into serious negotiations with the national association of realtors exploring ways to leverage the significant assets and capabilities of nar’srealtor property resource unit to support key components of upstream’s functionality at the nar midyear meetings the nar board of directors approved  million in funding to support upstream and amp development projects for realtors property resource upstreamre llc will now consider using some rpr services combined with other vendor services for the project upstream is not an mls real estate firms across america have obstreperous data management problems three of those problems include the disorderly replication of addedit the replication and inconsistency of data formats and the challenge of perfecting copyright these challenges that face firms are interrelated in many ways  definition obstreperous – noisy difficult to control unruly unmanageable disorderly undisciplined rowdy disruptive  the solution for duplicate addedit when a firm acquires a listing there are many actions that often take place before that listing is placed in the mls for example firms likely create a transaction in their back office system that allows expenses such as sign services photography service staging or other expenditures to be ordered and tracked franchise firms are also required to enter the listing into the franchise system for accounting although some of the larger mlss have created a new status for tracking this prelisting data management need most do not the duplication of addedit in multiple databases is problematic nobody wants to experience the repetitive data entry for a variety of reasons chiefly duplication of addedit causes increased labor expenses and is prone to errors moreover managing edits in multiple systems requires significant training and support the very best addedit solution in the industry has been developed by mlss wav group supported project upstream by creating a specification for an mls quality addedit solution it includes usability solutions like prepopulating the listing from tax record sources it also includes listing integrity solutions to prevent errors in data entry most importantly the construct supports the reso data dictionary standard and field level business rules the specification for upstream addedit is the same specification used in mlss across the nation data dictionary compliant public record auto population and mls rules compliant today rpr does not offer addedit functionality however the new funding by nar will allow them to add this to their roadmap upstreamre will need to consider waiting vs licensing an existing solution already in production the solution for replication and inconsistent data formats overlapping market disorder has plagued real estate forever it has caused firms to enter and maintain data in multiple mlss firms are also operating a wide range of back office data management systems including franchise data management solutions replicating data is the process of storing the same information in multiple databases it’s expensive and wasteful different data base formats also create incremental costs whenever systems need to share data it requires data mapping and aggregation again it’s expensive and wasteful firms participating in upstream will individually manage their data in a common format and in a common database realtors property resource is the largest single data repository for listing content in the nation it would make perfect sense for upstream to leverage that realtor member benefit to store and normalize listing records agent records office records firm records employee records and customer records and who knows what other significant synergies might real estate practitioners benefit from in the future as a result of this logical collaboration “upstream always has been about making practitioners much more efficient in the handling of their data thus lowering the cost time and effort they spend” said craig cheatham secretary of the upstreamre llc board “and brokers will be able to regain much better control of that data for which they ultimately are held responsible” rpr could provide project upstreamre with a head start that would allow participating brokers to get a head start on pulling their data together rpr also has a lot of additionally useful data that was not contemplated by project upstreamre but could be a way to augment a firm’s data the solution for data distribution project upstream recognizes the incredible lack of efficiency in data distribution upstream will solve this problem by providing firms with a single data distribution dashboard to send their data wherever they want – an mls system a franchise system a technology vendor or even a publisher the broker and only the broker will be in control of where its data goes today rpr does not have a data dashboard solution that would meet the needs of project upstreamre upstreamre will need to use one of the many commercial data distribution applications or work with rpr to evaluate their development capabilities in this area the image below shows how upstreamre and rpr might be integrated about the organizers project upstream has the support of the realty alliance keller williams homeservices of
