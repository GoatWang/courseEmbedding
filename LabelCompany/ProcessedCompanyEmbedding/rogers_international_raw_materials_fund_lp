chief financial officer have identified a material weakness have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december   the material weakness identified by

reporting these significant weaknesses did not result in any omission or misstatement of information required to be disclosed in reports filed by the partnership’s financial reporting management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af

under the framework in internal control—integrated framework a material weakness was identified in internal control over partner activity expenses and financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis beeland management has identified the following material weakness the infrastructure of personnel responsible for the daily administration is limited and does not allow for segregation of key duties this material weakness is pervasive across all operations of the partnership and leads to a reasonable possibility that

internal control over financial reporting there were no changes to internal control or financial reporting procedures during the fourth quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect internal control over financial reporting however as discussed above beeland management has identified a material weakness in our internal control procedures that could impact our financial reporting while management has taken certain steps to address the identified material weakness in internal control procedures as of the date of this report the beeland management has not hired any additional personnel beeland management has however engaged consultants to assist in the identification and design of effective internal controls provided employees of beeland management educational
