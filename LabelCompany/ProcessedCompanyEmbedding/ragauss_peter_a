industry playing it conservative is the game plan for baker hughes cfo peter ragauss “i’m the de facto steward of our resources capital and balance sheet” he says photo ken childress amid headlines about gas prices oil company profits and energy demand—all of which are rising—it’s plain to see energy creates wealth a few minutes into a conversation with peter ragauss however one realizes that the reverse is also true before oil makes money it’s money that makes oil “think about what it takes to develop a decentsized oil field” says ragauss senior vice president and cfo for houstonbased baker hughes inc which supplies oil field services products technology and systems to the oil and natural gas industries “first it requires economically risky exploration then you’ve got to drill wells and build pipelines and everything else to carry the product to market a year project is cash flownegative for the first – years of its life that’s billions of dollars up front before you see any return” in other words oil drilling is just as expensive as it is profitable and just as risky as it is lucrative to continually match demand with supply oil companies must funnel a constant stream of cash from producing properties to exploration properties along with the engineers who extract it therefore the financiers who fund energy are critically important “many oil and gas companies spend more than their cash flow in a given year so they’re always talking to lenders and investors” ragauss says “as a result their cfos are very active they have to understand the story and sell the story to raise the capital that’s needed to grow the business” the son of a cabinetmaker ragauss has been “raising capital” his entire life “i grew up in a pretty modest place under pretty modest means” says ragauss who had a paper route when he was  worked in a pizza parlor all through high school and earned extra income playing billiards in his hometown of grand rapids michigan “my parents didn’t have any spare money but i always had good pocket money that i earned myself” although he got his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and flirted with the idea of becoming an attorney ragauss’s dedication to work and money ultimately evolved into an interest in business after a brief career as a sales engineer he applied to business school ultimately graduating from harvard business school in  “global supply still has room it’s getting more expensive to drill but the resource is there”—peter ragauss “after business school i managed to land a job with one of the smaller investment banks kidder peabody which was really active in corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions for energy companies” ragauss says—and he has been an oilman ever since “energy was one of the biggest income sources for investment bankers and still is to this day that’s how i got involved in energy” ragauss spent nearly six years at new yorkbased kidder peabody because most of his clients were in houston he moved there in  when the firm opened a houston office “having seen all the activity in houston it seemed like a good move” ragauss says “houston has more public companies than any other city in the country except new york so there’s plenty of opportunity it seemed like a good place to build a career” that career took ragauss to autoparts supplier tenneco inc from 3 until  then to amoco in —eight months before it sold itself to british oil titan bp even before the sale closed he was the first amoco employee invited to move to london “i worked at bp until  which is when i was contacted by baker hughes” ragauss recalls “they were looking for a cfo and i knew i eventually wanted to get back to houston this was the perfect opportunity so we picked up everything and moved back” founded in  by howard hughes sr—the famous aviator’s father—baker hughes developed the oil industry’s first twocone drill bit ragauss manages a finance group of approximately  employees at the company with responsibilities ranging from accounting external reporting and internal control to investor relations tax and treasury his job is a crucial one as the company continues its historic legacy by drilling oil and gas wells for the world’s largest energy companies getting to know peter ragauss profile what motivates you most in life i live by the boy scout motto which is to do my best

they’re still young so we’ve still got about  years to see the results but that would be the accomplishment i would truly cherish profile if you could change one thing about your industry what would it be i think energy could and should garner more respect we’re the rodney dangerfield of industries there’s reasons for that—maybe we don’t do a very good job explaining ourselves maybe people feel powerless about the price of gasoline—but i think the energy industry is very efficient and competitive it’s not a bloated industry and i think people often forget that “we provide the ability to drill into the earth for miles measure the oil and gas that’s there with our sensors and then get the oil out of the ground reliably” ragauss says “i’m the de facto steward of our resources capital and balance sheet we’re in  countries and have eight product lines all requiring capital it’s my job to guide the business on where and how much to invest in those various geographies and products” during his sevenyear tenure ragauss has helped baker hughes grow its quarterly revenues from approximately  billion to more than  billion “we completely reorganized the company from seven fiercely independent divisions to a geographic operating structure” he says “we rewired all the roles and financial reporting systems within the company and on top of that we completed the secondlargest merger in the oilfield services business—the purchase of bj services in  which was a  billion deal i had a major role in all those developments” ragauss has also had a major role in streamlining the company’s operations which keeps baker hughes competitive “our customers beat us up pretty hard to keep our costs down” ragauss says “if they can save  percent on a  million well that’s real money so we have to constantly chase efficiencies we like many have moved manufacturing to lowercost locations consolidated suppliers and redesigned many of our factory floors to be more efficient we’ve taken hundreds of millions of dollars out of our supplychain and backoffice costs” ragauss spends as much time on strategy as he does on streamlining which gives him a unique perspective on some of the world’s most pressing energy issues not the least of which is supply and demand “we’ve got cheap and abundant natural gas now and for the first time in decades we’ve had rising us oil production all coming out of the shale plays in north dakota and the eagle ford in south texas” he says “that’s the most rapid shift of anything that’s occurred in the last few years other sources of growth are brazil angola and iraq these provinces are taking off as we speak all this is to say global supply still has room it’s getting more expensive to drill but the resource is there on the demand side it’s true that mature economies like europe and the us are seeing oil consumption fall but that’s being offset by china and india those countries are massively short on energy and they’re going to find a way to get it” that there’s still plenty of supply and lots of demand means alternative energy is a long way from replacing fossil fuels “there are positive developments in renewables and other sources of energy but their costs are still too high and their production rates too low” ragauss says “i don’t see them making economic breakthroughs at least for the next decade or two they’ll grow but they’re still a very small slice of the energysupply pie” ragauss has seen with his own eyes just how big that pie is and it’s his job to cut baker hughes as large a piece as possible “there’s oil all over the world” he says “some of it’s in easier places some in more difficult places but it’s all over take iraq for instance we had the iraq war and now it’s open to investment with enormous reserves it’s my job to figure out how much we’re willing to risk in what is clearly a very risky place there are no easy answers but it’s what cfos do every day of the week” in this issue go with
