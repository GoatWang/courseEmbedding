diligence on an alternative investment vehicle as it shows compelling interest in the companys offerings on its platform takung art  listed pieces transaction growth is the seed that eventually blooms into profit growth in an efficiently operated company profit margin takung arts profit growth for q  was mainly because of quarterly growth in listing fees and management fee revenue the companys profit margin is  its operating margin for the trailing twelve months is  as a profitability ratio profit margin is important to consider as it quantifies what percentage of sales is made up of net income a business can cut costs to improve this ratio or grow revenues takung art has grown its revenue however the company had quarteroverquarter increases of  in general and administrative expenses and  in selling expenses so it must get a handle on these increases to facilitate even greater profits revenueemployee  incomeemployee takung art is operating relatively efficiently with

efficiently using shareholder funds to produce profits levered free cash flow takung arts levered free cash flow for the trailing twelve months is  million alibabas is  billion amazons levered free cash flow for the trailing twelve months is  billion etsys is   million ive mentioned levered free cash flow many times i always consider this financial metric because it tells me how much money a business has after it has met its financial commitments positive levered free cash flow enables a company to reinvest in its business it also tells me that company management has the funds to institute continue or increase dividends as a dividend investor primarily i always consider levered free cash flow so takung arts positive here albeit a small player versus the alibaba and amazon giants two challenges in art investing discretionary income investors with less financial resources depend on discretionary income when wanting to make purchases of art the art marketplace is competitive and volatile in economic upswings in these uncertain economic times art companies such as takung art must make art purchasing as affordable as possible while working to maintain and grow sales and profit margins this is easier said than accomplished and demands creative marketing and a good product mix appraisal and valuation the sector is dependent on firstrate appraising and valuation of artwork this ensures an entitys credibility with the art buying community from a profitability standpoint proper appraisal and valuation ensures a company sets a proper market value on the art it offers for sale this can make the difference between healthy profits or eroding losses the black market the new york times noted that billions of dollars worth of art goes missing every year what is the value of stolen art  ny times  november   therefore this is billions lost for legitimate companies duking it out in bricks and mortar and online venues its also something that makes people sometimes wary of buying art unless they can actually validate an art pieces true worth and authenticity much of this art ends up in the hands of unprincipled and dishonest art dealers  a challenge to honest players in the industry conclusion takung art has much going for it as it navigates the online artwork marketplace it is aggressive in growing market penetration the company recently obtained loans for us million to build hkd hong kong dollar reserves to support ongoing expansion of trading in china the company has a strong balance sheet at september   takung arts cash and cash equivalents totaled  this represents an increase from  on december   furthermore the company has robust demand for its artwork as evidenced by its growing sales and processed transactions as a foray into the art world its a unique investment opportunity for investors willing to ride the gyrations of the artsy art sector for now though ill wait to see if takung art institutes a dividend
