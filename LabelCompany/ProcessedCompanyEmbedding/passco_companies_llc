pursuing new stores to allow his children to focus on their college careers raghu and rohit attended california state polytechnic university pomona and majored in business and electrical engineering respectively both brothers pursued other careers after graduation but decided they didn’t have the passion for what they were doing so they went back to the franchising business they each became a manager of one of the four stores the family owned and took more than  percent pay cuts to do it even with the drastic decrease in financial freedom both were far happier than they had been in their previous occupations it was at this point that they realized that the franchising business their father had started years before could be the springboard for growing a hugely successful entrepreneurial venture as coceos at marwaha group they use the lessons they learned from their father each day and have built a business that now boasts  companyowned locations and another  overseen through various business ventures back to top finalists bill passo ceo passco companies llc bill passo started with humble beginnings but he never let that stop him from seizing opportunities and turning challenges into successes he earned his juris doctor at ucla and began practicing law shortly after graduation at the age of  passo decided to quit his job and move back to orange county to start his own law practice with no clients and a wife and a child to take care of he was determined to make his new law practice work he went to several banks for a loan of  but was unsuccessful many times before he finally found a bank that agreed to loan him the money he capitalized on the opportunity and within six months he was able to pay back the loan and purchase a house for his family it didn’t take long before passo determined he was capable of running his own business and formed passco companies llc the multifamily and commercial real estate investment firm has built an investor services department that is as robust as any other department in the company it’s a testament to passo’s willingness to put the interest of his investors above all else all investors have access to staff and management services and they receive frequent communication from the company passo invests in each property just like he would invest if it were his own and genuinely cares about his investors as ceo passo prefers what he calls an “enlistandenroll” management style that allows him to attract and retain the best talent when the company was going through management changes the new president personally requested that passo be more involved in the company because of how important and influential he is to all the employees he trusts his team which is what allows him to think more broadly he refuses to micromanage anyone and prefers to look at accomplishments and teamwork as a measure of success back to top michael cerillo ceo ben hoch president u brands the experiences relationships and innovation michael cerillo and ben hoch employed during their very successful first venture board dudes became the formula that allowed their new company u brands to achieve great success in only three years in january  hoch and cerillo met for coffee to discuss their next project having sold their last company and finished their time on the acquiring company’s board following the transition they decided that their chemistry and brand in the industry was too important to break apart that day they formed the business plan for u brands a company with a focus on creating a boutique feel to stationary products that targets the mass retail market soon after they were able to secure meetings with some of the largest national retailers by leveraging their connections and reputation from their first business hoch who is president and cerillo who serves as the ceo believe their funloving personalities and approach to business meetings have enabled them to form and maintain the relationships necessary to excel in the industry they quickly hired key talent that helped them design the initial skus that landed them in target walmart staples and other retailers before building a single prototype the response to their business and product lines were so great that u brands achieved its threeyear revenue projections within its first  months at the end of  u brands owned the entire stationary display at target half of walmart and key end cap displays at staples and bed bath  beyond hoch and cerillo deflect all the credit to their innovative design team for creating product lines that continue to stay ahead of the trends and their competitors however it is hoch and cerillo’s energy industry expertise and personal connections that are the true

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record

are subject to double taxation that is one tax at the corporate level on the corporations net income and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed s corporations have only one level of taxation all of their income is allocated to the shareholders however c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability in addition s corporations are subject to limitations such as the number and type of shareholders they can have legalzoom will help you start a c corporation or an s corporation get started by answering a few questions about your company and we will file your paperwork with the secretary of state how do i choose a corporate name in general the name of a corporation must end with incorporated corporation or an abbreviation of one of these a name will not be accepted if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name of another corporation already formed in that state many states also restrict the use of certain terms in a corporations name like bank police or insurance legalzoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names in order of preference we will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are available please note that for government purposes the names abc inc and abc corp are identical therefore you should disregard spaces periods and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name choices if the name of your corporation will be used in connection with goods or services you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark protection for the name this helps ensure that no one else in the us may use that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services except in areas where someone else is already using that name is a corporation required to have a registered agent each corporation must have a registered agent some states use the term resident agent or statutory agent but the concept is the same this

in the state of formation with a street address po boxes are not acceptable or  a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation that provides registered agent services one of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is that any officer or director of a corporation or manager or member of an llc can act as the registered agent however there are some advantages to having another person or company act as your registered agent first this adds an extra layer of privacy since the registered agents name and address are publicly available second this helps limit the risk that if your corporation or llc is named as a defendant in a lawsuit no one will surprise you at home on a sunday night with court
