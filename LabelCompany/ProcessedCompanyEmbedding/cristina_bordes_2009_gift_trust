daughters on the way to school  gustav adolph hennig painting in a social context trust has several connotations definitions of trust typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects one party trustor is willing to rely on the actions of another party trustee the situation is directed to the future in addition the trustor voluntarily or forcedly abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee as a consequence the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the others actions they can only develop and evaluate expectations the uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired vladimir ilych lenin expressed this idea with the sentence trust is good control is better trust can be attributed to relationships between people it can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain some studies indicate that trust can be altered eg by the application of oxytocin conceptually trust is also attributable to relationships within and between social groups history families friends communities organisations companies nations etc it is a popular approach to frame the dynamics of intergroup and intragroup interactions in terms of trust the trust formations of people towards different actors in society has been shaped into a generic model of trust with three levels of application ie macro micro and meso when it comes to the relationship between people and technology the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute the intentional stance demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies however rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artefacts one of the key current challenges in the social sciences is to rethink how the rapid progress of technology has impacted constructs such as trust this is specifically true for information technology that dramatically alters causation in social systems in the social sciences the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research in sociology and psychology the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of belief in the honesty fairness or benevolence of another party the term confidence is more appropriate for a belief in the competence of the other party based on the most recent researchcitation needed a failure in trust may be forgiven more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty in economics trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions in all cases trust is a heuristic decision rule allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning contents  sales and marketing  sociology  psychology  the social identity approach  philosophy  economics  systems  see also  references  further reading  external links sales and marketingedit an analysis of the multiple scholarly writings on the concept of the trust that develops between a seller and a buyer reveals that it rests on four structural variables  affinities or how similar their respective background and culture are  benevolence or the care one takes in the wellbeing of the other  abilities how competent the seller is deemed to be and how wellarticulated the buyer is and  integrity the first two variables are considered to be emotional because they are experienced as such and the last two are considered to be cognitive because they involve some level of rationalization sociologyedit when it comes to trust sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems interest in trust has grown significantly since the early eighties from the early works of luhmann barber  and giddens see  for a more detailed overview this growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by ongoing changes in society characterised as late modernity and postmodernity trust is one of several social constructs an element of the social reality it does not exist outside of our vision of the other this image can be real or imaginary but it is this one which permits the creation of the trust other constructs frequently discussed together with trust are control confidence risk meaning and power trust is naturally attributable to relationships between social actors both individuals and groups social systems because trust is a social construct it is valid to discuss whether trust can be trusted eg ie whether social trust operates as expected society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience and contingency of new possibilities without trust all contingent possibilities should be always considered leading to a paralysis of inaction trust can be seen as a bet on one of contingent futures the one that may deliver benefits once the bet is decided ie trust is granted the trustor suspends his or her disbelief and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all because of it trust acts as a reductor of social complexity allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered or even impossible to consider at all specifically for cooperation sociology tends to focus on two distinct views the macro view of social systems and a micro view of individual social actors where it borders with social psychology similarly views on trust follow this dichotomy therefore on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust the behavioural approach to trust is usually assumed  while actions of social actors are measurable leading to statistical modelling of trust this systemic approach can be contrasted  with studies on social actors and their decisionmaking process in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain and allow to model the emergence of trust sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors and specifically that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency being an attractive alternative to control trust is specifically valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee modern information technologies not only facilitated the transition towards postmodern society but they also challenged traditional views on trust empirical studies  confirms the new approach to the traditional question regarding whether technology artefacts can be attributed with trust trust is not attributable to artefacts but it is a representation of trust in social actors such as designers creators and operators of technology properties of technological artefacts form a message  to determine trustworthiness of those agents the discussion about the impact of information technologies is still in progress however it is worth noting a conceptual rethinking of technologymediated social groups or the proposition of a unifying sociotechnical view on trust from the perspective of social actors psychologyedit in psychology trust is believing that the person who is trusted will do what is expected it starts at the family and grows to others according to the psychoanalyst erik erikson development of basic trust is the first state psychosocial development occurring or failing during the first two years of life success results in feelings of security trust and optimism while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust possibly resulting in attachment disorders a persons dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a personality trait and as such is one of the strongest predictors of subjective wellbeing it has been argued that trust increases subjective wellbeing because it enhances the quality of ones interpersonal relationships and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships trust is integral to the idea of social influence it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting the notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others institutions eg government agencies and objects such as machines however once again perception of honesty competence and value similarity slightly similar to benevolence are essential there are three different forms of trust trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy trustworthiness are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person and trust propensity being able to rely on people once trust is lost by obvious violation of one of these three determinants it is very hard to regain thus there is clear asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust hence being and acting trustworthy should be considered the only sure way to maintain a trust level increasingly much research has been done on the notion of trust and its social implications barbara misztal in her book attempts to combine all notions of trust together she points out three basic things that trust does in the lives of people it makes social life predictable it creates a sense of community and it makes it easier for people to work together in the context of sexual trust riki robbins describes four stages of trust in the context of information theory ed gerck defines and contrasts trust with social functions such as power surveillance and accountability from a social identity perspective the propensity to trust in strangers see ingroup favoritism arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership stereotypes or the need to maintain the groups positive distinctiveness in addition to the social influence in organizational settings trust may have a positive influence on the behaviors perceptions and performances of a person trust has a circular relationship with organizational justice perceptions such that perceived justice leads to trust which in turn promotes future perceptions of justice one factor that enhances trust in a human being is facial resemblance through digital manipulation of facial resemblance in a twoperson sequential trust game supporting evidence was found that having similar facial features facial resemblance enhanced trust in a subject’s respective partner though facial resemblance was shown to increase trust facial resemblance had the effect of decreased sexual desire in a particular partner in a series of tests digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects to be evaluated for attractiveness within the context of a long term or short term relationship the results showed that within the context of a short term relationship which is dependent on sexual desire similar facial features caused a decrease in said desire within the context of a long term relationship which is dependent on trust similar facial features increased the attractiveness of an individual leading one to believe that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships structure often creates trust in a person that encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace working anywhere may be stressful and takes effort by having a conveniently organized area to work on concentration will increase as well as effort structure is not just a method of order it increases trust and therefore makes a workplace manageable a structured ordered environment produces trust as one may contain increased cooperation and perform on a higher level people may work together and achieve success through trust while working on projects that rely on each individual’s contribution conversely where trust is absent projects can fail especially if this lack of trust has not been identified and addressed this is one facet of vpect analysis this thinking framework is used when studying information systems identifying and dealing with cases where information providers information users and those responsible for processing information do not trust one another can result in the removal of a risk factor for a project ones social relationship characterized by low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement are expected to be associated with low academic achievement individuals that are in relationships characterized by high levels of social trust are more apt to openly exchange information and to act with caring benevolence toward one another than those in relationships lacking trust an important key to treating sexual victimization of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child failure for the adults to validate the sexual abuse contributes to the childs difficulty towards trusting self and others trust is often affected by the erosion of a marriagecitation needed children of divorce do not exhibit less trust in mothers partners spouses friends and associates than their peers of intact families the impact of parental divorce is limited to trust in the father the social identity approachedit the social identity approach explains trust in strangers as a function of groupbased stereotypes or ingroup favouring behaviours based on salient group memberships with regard to ingroup favoritism people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from ingroup members in comparison to outgroup members this greater expectation then translates into a higher propensity to trust an ingroup rather than outgroup member it has been pointed out that it is only advantageous to form such expectations of an ingroup stranger if they too know the group membership of the recipient there is considerable empirical activity related to the social identity approach allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand groupbased trust in strangers they may be operationalised as unilateral or bilateral relationships of exchange general social categories such as university affiliation course majors and even adhoc groups have been used to distinguish between ingroup and outgroup members in unilateral studies of trust the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an ingroup or outgroup member they would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction simulating brewer’s notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about groupbased trust and hence cooperation participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out in bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender trusting behaviour on the part of the sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money the above empirical research has demonstrated that when group membership is made salient and known to both parties trust is granted more readily to ingroup members than outgroup members this occurred even when the ingroup stereotype was comparatively less positive than an outgroup’s eg psychology versus nursing majors in the absence of personal identity cues and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money ie in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger in contrast when only the recipient was made aware of group membership trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes the group with the more positive stereotype was trusted eg one’s university affiliation over another even over that of the ingroup eg nursing over psychology majors another reason for ingroup favouring behaviours in trust could be attributed to the need to maintain ingroup positive distinctiveness particularly in the presence of social identity threat it should also be noted that trust in outgroup strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed philosophyedit some philosophers argue that trust is more than a relationship of reliance philosophers such as annette baier have made a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed whilst reliance can only be disappointed baier   carolyn mcleod explains baiers argument by giving the following examples we can rely on our clock to give the time but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks thus we cannot say that we trusted it we are not trusting when we are suspicious of the other person because this is in fact an expression of distrust mcleod  thus trust is different from reliance in the sense that a truster accepts the risk of being betrayed the definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something leads to eliminate the notion of risk from the definition because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable for example to have an expectation of a friend arriving to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years is a confident expectation whether or not we agree with her annoying late arrivals the trust is not about what we wish for rather it is in the consistency of the data of our habits as a result there is no risk or betrayal because the data now exists as collective knowledge economicsedit see also consumer confidence trust in economics is treated as an explanation for a difference between actual human behaviour and the one that can be explained by the individual desire to maximize ones utility in economic terms trust can provide an explanation of a difference between nash equilibrium and the observed equilibrium such an approach can be applied to individuals and well as societies trust is also seen as an economic lubricant reducing the cost of transactions between parties enabling new forms of cooperation and generally furthering business activities employment and prosperity this observation  created a significant interest in considering trust as a form of social capital and has led research into closer understanding of the process of creation and distribution of such capital it has been claimed that higher level of social trust is positively correlated with economic development even though the original concept of high trust and low trust societies may not necessarily hold it has been widely accepted and demonstrated that social trust benefits the economy  and that a low level of trust inhibits economic growth theoretical economical modelling  demonstrated that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to trustworthiness of the other party such a level of trust leads to efficient market trusting less lead to the loss of economic opportunities trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation economics is also interested in quantifying trust usually in monetary terms the level of correlation between increase in profit margin  or decrease in transactional cost can be used as indicators of economic value of trust economic trust games are popularly used to empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions there are several games and gamelike scenarios related to trust that have been tried with certain preferences to those that allow to estimate confidence in monetary terms games of trust are designed in a way that their nash equilibrium differ from pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximise his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation while cooperating partners can benefit the classical version of the game of trust has been described in  as an abstracted investment game using the scenario of an investor and a broker investor can invest a fraction of his money and broker can return only part of his gains if both players follow their economical best interest the investor should never invest and the broker will never be able to repay anything thus the flow of money flow its volume and character is attributable entirely to the existence of trust the game can be played as oneoff or as a repetitive one between the same or different sets of players to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships several other variants of this game exist reversing rules lead to the game of distrust predeclarations can be used to establish intentions of players while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate perception of both players the game can be also played by several players on the closed market with or without information about reputation other interesting games are eg binarychoice trust games the giftexchange game  and various other forms of social games specifically games based on the prisoners dilemma  are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity the work of rachel botsman is also very important about collaboration economy the popularisation of ecommerce opened the discussion of trust in economy to new challenges while at the same time elevating the importance of trust and desire to understand customer decision to trust for example interpersonal relationship between the buyer and the seller has been disintermediated by the technology and had to be improved upon alternatively web sites could be made to convince the buyer to trust the seller regardless of sellers actual trustworthiness eg  reputationbased systems improved on trust assessment by allowing to capture the collective perception of trustworthiness generating significant interest in various models of reputation systemsedit in systems a trusted component has a set of properties which another component can rely on if a trusts b this means that a violation in those properties of b might compromise the correct operation of a observe that those properties of b trusted by a might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to b’s actual properties this happens when the designer of the overall system does not take the relation into account in consequence trust should be placed to the extent of the component’s trustworthiness the trustworthiness of a component is thus not surprisingly defined by how well it secures a set of functional and nonfunctional properties deriving from its architecture construction and environment and evaluated as appropriate see alsoedit attachment theory credulity gullibility intimacy misplaced trust personal boundaries position of trust

enhances the quality of ones interpersonal relationships and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships trust is integral to the idea of social influence it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting the notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others institutions eg government agencies and objects such as machines however once again perception of honesty competence and value similarity slightly similar to benevolence are essential there are three different forms of trust trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy trustworthiness are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person and trust propensity being able to rely on people once trust is lost by obvious violation of one of these three determinants it is very hard to regain thus there is clear asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust hence being and acting trustworthy should be considered the only sure way to maintain a trust level increasingly much research has been done on the notion of trust and its social implications barbara misztal in her book attempts to combine all notions of trust together she points out three basic things that trust does in the lives of people it makes social life predictable it creates a sense of community and it makes it easier for people to work together in the context of sexual trust riki robbins describes four stages of trust in the context of information theory ed gerck defines and contrasts trust with social functions such as power surveillance and accountability from a social identity perspective the propensity to trust in strangers see ingroup favoritism arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership stereotypes or the need to maintain the groups positive distinctiveness in addition to the social influence in organizational settings trust may have a positive influence on the behaviors perceptions and performances of a person trust has a circular relationship with organizational justice perceptions such that perceived justice leads to trust which in turn promotes future perceptions of justice one factor that enhances trust in a human being is facial resemblance through digital manipulation of facial resemblance in a twoperson sequential trust game supporting evidence was found that having similar facial features facial resemblance enhanced trust in a subject’s respective partner though facial resemblance was shown to increase trust facial resemblance had the effect of decreased sexual desire in a particular partner in a series of tests digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects to be evaluated for attractiveness within the context of a long term or short term relationship the results showed that within the context of a short term relationship which is dependent on sexual desire similar facial features caused a decrease in said desire within the context of a long term relationship which is dependent on trust similar facial features increased the attractiveness of an individual leading one to believe that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships structure often creates trust in a person that encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace working anywhere may be stressful and takes effort by having a conveniently organized area to work on concentration will increase as well as effort structure is not just a method of order it increases trust and therefore makes a workplace manageable a structured ordered environment produces trust as one may contain increased cooperation and perform on a higher level people may work together and achieve success through trust while working on projects that rely on each individual’s contribution conversely where trust is absent projects can fail especially if this lack of trust has not been identified and addressed this is one facet of vpect analysis this thinking framework is used when studying information systems identifying and dealing with cases where information providers information users and those responsible for processing information do not trust one another can result in the removal of a risk factor for a project ones social relationship characterized by low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement are expected to be associated with low academic achievement individuals that are in relationships characterized by high levels of social trust are more apt to openly exchange information and to act with caring benevolence toward one another than those in relationships lacking trust an important key to treating sexual victimization of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child failure for the adults to validate the sexual abuse contributes to the childs difficulty towards trusting self and others trust is often affected by the erosion of a marriagecitation needed children of divorce do not exhibit less trust in mothers partners spouses friends and associates than their peers of intact families the impact of parental divorce is limited to trust in the father the social identity approachedit the social identity approach explains trust in strangers as a function of groupbased stereotypes or ingroup favouring behaviours based on salient group memberships with regard to ingroup favoritism people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from ingroup members in comparison to outgroup members this greater expectation then translates into a higher propensity to trust an ingroup rather than outgroup member it has been pointed out that it is only advantageous to form such expectations of an ingroup stranger if they too know the group membership of the recipient there is considerable empirical activity related to the social identity approach allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand groupbased trust in strangers they may be operationalised as unilateral or bilateral relationships of exchange general social categories such as university affiliation course majors and even adhoc groups have been used to distinguish between ingroup and outgroup members in unilateral studies of trust the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an ingroup or outgroup member they would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction simulating brewer’s notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about groupbased trust and hence cooperation participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out in bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender trusting behaviour on the part of the sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money the above empirical research has demonstrated that when group membership is made salient and known to both parties trust is granted more readily to ingroup members than outgroup members this occurred even when the ingroup stereotype was comparatively less positive than an outgroup’s eg psychology versus nursing majors in the absence of personal identity cues and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money ie in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger in contrast when only the recipient was made aware of group membership trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes the group with the more positive stereotype was trusted eg one’s university affiliation over another even over that of the ingroup eg nursing over psychology majors another reason for ingroup favouring behaviours in trust could be attributed to the need to maintain ingroup positive distinctiveness particularly in the presence of social identity threat it should also be noted that trust in outgroup strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed philosophyedit some philosophers argue that trust is more than a relationship of reliance philosophers such as annette baier have made a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed whilst reliance can only be disappointed baier   carolyn mcleod explains baiers argument by giving the following examples we can rely on our clock to give the time but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks thus we cannot say that we trusted it we are not trusting when we are suspicious of the other person because this is in fact an expression of distrust mcleod  thus trust is different from reliance in the sense that a truster accepts the risk of being betrayed the definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something leads to eliminate the notion of risk from the definition because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable for example to have an expectation of a friend arriving to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years is a confident expectation whether or not we agree with her annoying late arrivals the trust is not about what we wish for rather it is in the consistency of the data of our habits as a result there is no risk or betrayal because the data now exists as collective knowledge economicsedit see also consumer confidence trust in economics is treated as an explanation for a difference between actual human behaviour and the one that can be explained by the individual desire to maximize ones utility in economic terms trust can provide an explanation of a difference between nash equilibrium and the observed equilibrium such an approach can be applied to individuals and well as societies trust is also seen as an economic lubricant reducing the cost of transactions between parties enabling new forms of cooperation and generally furthering business activities employment and prosperity this observation  created a significant interest in considering trust as a form of social capital and has led research into closer understanding of the process of creation and distribution of such capital it has been claimed that higher level of social trust is positively correlated with economic development even though the original concept of high trust and low trust societies may not necessarily hold it has been widely accepted and demonstrated that social trust benefits the economy  and that a low level of trust inhibits economic growth theoretical economical modelling  demonstrated that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to trustworthiness of the other party such a level of trust leads to efficient market trusting less lead to the loss of economic opportunities trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation economics is also interested in quantifying trust usually in monetary terms the level of correlation between increase in profit margin  or decrease in transactional cost can be used as indicators of economic value of trust economic trust games are popularly used to empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions there are several games and gamelike scenarios related to trust that have been tried with certain preferences to those that allow to estimate confidence in monetary terms games of trust are designed in a way that their nash equilibrium differ from pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximise his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation while cooperating partners can benefit the classical version of the game of trust has been described in  as an abstracted investment game using the scenario of an investor and a broker investor can invest a fraction of his money and broker can return only part of his gains if both players follow their economical best interest the investor should never invest and the broker will never be able to repay anything thus the flow of money flow its volume and character is attributable entirely to the existence of trust the game can be played as oneoff or as a repetitive one between the same or different sets of players to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships several other variants of this game exist reversing rules lead to the game of distrust predeclarations can be used to establish intentions of players while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate perception of both players the game can be also played by several players on the closed market with or without information about reputation other interesting games are eg binarychoice trust games the giftexchange game  and various other forms of social games specifically games based on the prisoners dilemma  are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity the work of rachel botsman is also very important about collaboration economy the popularisation of ecommerce opened the discussion of trust in economy to new challenges while at the same time elevating the importance of trust and desire to understand customer decision to trust for example interpersonal relationship between the buyer and the seller has been disintermediated by the technology and had to be improved upon alternatively web sites could be made to convince the buyer to trust the seller regardless of sellers actual trustworthiness eg  reputationbased systems improved on trust assessment by allowing to capture the collective perception of trustworthiness generating significant interest in various models of reputation systemsedit in systems a trusted component has a set of properties which another component can rely on if a trusts b this means that a violation in those properties of b might compromise the correct operation of a observe that those properties of b trusted by a might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to b’s actual properties this happens when the designer of the overall system does not take the relation into account in consequence trust should be placed to the extent of the component’s trustworthiness the trustworthiness of a component is thus not surprisingly defined by how well it secures a set of functional and nonfunctional properties deriving from its architecture construction and environment and evaluated as appropriate see alsoedit attachment theory credulity gullibility intimacy misplaced trust

shock shyness sorrow suffering surprise trust wonder worry v t e trust the artists daughters on the way to school  gustav adolph hennig painting in a social context trust has several connotations definitions of trust typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects one party trustor is willing to rely on the actions of another party trustee the situation is directed to the future in addition the trustor voluntarily or forcedly abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee as a consequence the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the others actions they can only develop and evaluate expectations the uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired vladimir ilych lenin expressed this idea with the sentence trust is good control is better trust can be attributed to relationships between people it can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain some studies indicate that trust can be altered eg by the application of oxytocin conceptually trust is also attributable to relationships within and between social groups history families friends communities organisations companies nations etc it is a popular approach to frame the dynamics of intergroup and intragroup interactions in terms of trust the trust formations of people towards different actors in society has been shaped into a generic model of trust with three levels of application ie macro micro and meso when it comes to the relationship between people and technology the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute the intentional stance demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies however rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artefacts one of the key current challenges in the social sciences is to rethink how the rapid progress of technology has impacted constructs such as trust this is specifically true for information technology that dramatically alters causation in social systems in the social sciences the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research in sociology and psychology the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of belief in the honesty fairness or benevolence of another party the term confidence is more appropriate for a belief in the competence of the other party based on the most recent researchcitation needed a failure in trust may be forgiven more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty in economics trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions in all cases trust is a heuristic decision rule allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning contents  sales and marketing  sociology  psychology  the social identity approach  philosophy  economics  systems  see also  references  further reading  external links sales and marketingedit an analysis of the multiple scholarly writings on the concept of the trust that develops between a seller and a buyer reveals that it rests on four structural variables  affinities or how similar their respective background and culture are  benevolence or the care one takes in the wellbeing of the other  abilities how competent the seller is deemed to be and how wellarticulated the buyer is and  integrity the first two variables are considered to be emotional because they are experienced as such and the last two are considered to be cognitive because they involve some level of rationalization sociologyedit when it comes to trust sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems interest in trust has grown significantly since the early eighties from the early works of luhmann barber  and giddens see  for a more detailed overview this growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by ongoing changes in society characterised as late modernity and postmodernity trust is one of several social constructs an element of the social reality it does not exist outside of our vision of the other this image can be real or imaginary but it is this one which permits the creation of the trust other constructs frequently discussed together with trust are control confidence risk meaning and power trust is naturally attributable to relationships between social actors both individuals and groups social systems because trust is a social construct it is valid to discuss whether trust can be trusted eg ie whether social trust operates as expected society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience and contingency of new possibilities without trust all contingent possibilities should be always considered leading to a paralysis of inaction trust can be seen as a bet on one of contingent futures the one that may deliver benefits once the bet is decided ie trust is granted the trustor suspends his or her disbelief and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all because of it trust acts as a reductor of social complexity allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered or even impossible to consider at all specifically for cooperation sociology tends to focus on two distinct views the macro view of social systems and a micro view of individual social actors where it borders with social psychology similarly views on trust follow this dichotomy therefore on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust the behavioural approach to trust is usually assumed  while actions of social actors are measurable leading to statistical modelling of trust this systemic approach can be contrasted  with studies on social actors and their decisionmaking process in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain and allow to model the emergence of trust sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors and specifically that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency being an attractive alternative to control trust is specifically valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee modern information technologies not only facilitated the transition towards postmodern society but they also challenged traditional views on trust empirical studies  confirms the new approach to the traditional question regarding whether technology artefacts can be attributed with trust trust is not attributable to artefacts but it is a representation of trust in social actors such as designers creators and operators of technology properties of technological artefacts form a message  to determine trustworthiness of those agents the discussion about the impact of information technologies is still in progress however it is worth noting a conceptual rethinking of technologymediated social groups or the proposition of a unifying sociotechnical view on trust from the perspective of social actors psychologyedit in psychology trust is believing that the person who is trusted will do what is expected it starts at the family and grows to others according to the psychoanalyst erik erikson development of basic trust is the first state psychosocial development occurring or failing during the first two years of life success results in feelings of security trust and optimism while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust possibly resulting in attachment disorders a persons dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a personality trait and as such is one of the strongest predictors of subjective wellbeing it has been argued that trust increases subjective wellbeing because it enhances the quality of ones interpersonal relationships and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships trust is integral to the idea of social influence it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting the notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others institutions eg government agencies and objects such as machines however once again perception of honesty competence and value similarity slightly similar to benevolence are essential there are three different forms of trust trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they

clock to give the time but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks thus we cannot say that we trusted it we are not trusting when we are suspicious of the other person because this is in fact an expression of distrust mcleod  thus trust is different from reliance in the sense that a truster accepts the risk of being betrayed the definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something leads to eliminate the notion of risk from the definition because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable for example to have an expectation of a friend arriving to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years is a confident expectation whether or not we agree with her annoying late arrivals the trust is not about what we wish for rather it is in the consistency of the data of our habits as a result there is no risk or betrayal because the data now exists as collective knowledge economicsedit see also consumer confidence trust in economics is treated as an explanation for a difference between actual human behaviour and the one that can be explained by the individual desire to maximize ones utility in economic terms trust can provide an explanation of a difference between nash equilibrium and the observed equilibrium such an approach can be applied to individuals and well as societies trust is also seen as an economic lubricant reducing the cost of transactions between parties enabling new forms of cooperation and generally furthering business activities employment and prosperity this observation  created a significant interest in considering trust as a form of social capital and has led research into closer understanding of the process of creation and distribution of such capital it has been claimed that higher level of social trust is positively correlated with economic development even though the original concept of high trust and low trust societies may not necessarily hold it has been widely accepted and demonstrated that social trust benefits the economy  and that a low level of trust inhibits economic growth theoretical economical modelling  demonstrated that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to trustworthiness of the other party such a level of trust leads to efficient market trusting less lead to the loss of economic opportunities trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation economics is also interested in quantifying trust usually in monetary terms the level of correlation between increase in profit margin  or decrease in transactional cost can be used as indicators of economic value of trust economic trust games are popularly used to empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions there are several games and gamelike scenarios related to trust that have been tried with certain preferences to those that allow to estimate confidence in monetary terms games of trust are designed in a way that their nash equilibrium differ from pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximise his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation while cooperating partners can benefit the classical version of the game of trust has been described in  as an abstracted investment game using the scenario of an investor and a broker investor can invest a fraction of his money and broker can return only part of his gains if both players follow their economical best interest the investor should never invest and the broker will never be able to repay anything thus the flow of money flow its volume and character is attributable entirely to the existence of trust the game can be played as oneoff or as a repetitive one between the same or different sets of players to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships several other variants of this game exist reversing rules lead to the game of distrust predeclarations can be used to establish intentions of players while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate perception of both players the game can be also played by several players on the closed market with or without information about reputation other interesting games are eg binarychoice trust games the giftexchange game  and various other forms of social games specifically games based on the prisoners dilemma  are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity the work of rachel botsman is also very important about collaboration economy the popularisation of ecommerce opened the discussion of trust in economy to new challenges while at the same time elevating the importance of trust and desire to understand customer decision to trust for example interpersonal relationship between the buyer and the seller has been disintermediated by the technology and had to be improved upon alternatively web sites could be made to convince the buyer to trust the seller regardless of sellers actual trustworthiness eg  reputationbased systems improved on trust assessment by allowing to capture the collective perception of trustworthiness generating significant interest in various models of reputation systemsedit in systems a trusted component has a set of properties which another component can rely on if a trusts b this means that a violation in those properties of b might compromise the correct operation of a observe that those properties of b trusted by a might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to b’s actual properties this happens when the designer of the overall system does not take the relation into account in consequence trust should be placed to the extent of the component’s trustworthiness the trustworthiness of a component is thus not surprisingly defined by how well it secures a set of functional

shock shyness sorrow suffering surprise trust wonder worry v t e trust the artists daughters on the way to school  gustav adolph hennig painting in a social context trust has several connotations definitions of trust typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects one party trustor is willing to rely on the actions of another party trustee the situation is directed to the future in addition the trustor voluntarily or forcedly abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee as a consequence the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the others actions they can only develop and evaluate expectations the uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired vladimir ilych lenin expressed this idea with the sentence trust is good control is better trust can be attributed to relationships between people it can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain some studies indicate that trust can be altered eg by the application of oxytocin conceptually trust is also attributable to relationships within and between social groups history families friends communities organisations companies nations etc it is a popular approach to frame the dynamics of intergroup and intragroup interactions in terms of trust the trust formations of people towards different actors in society has been shaped into a generic model of trust with three levels of application ie macro micro and meso when it comes to the relationship between people and technology the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute the intentional stance demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies however rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artefacts one of the key current challenges in the social sciences is to rethink how the rapid progress of technology has impacted constructs such as trust this is specifically true for information technology that dramatically alters causation in social systems in the social sciences the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research in sociology and psychology the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of belief in the honesty fairness or benevolence of another party the term confidence is more appropriate for a belief in the competence of the other party based on the most recent researchcitation needed a failure in trust may be forgiven more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty in economics trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions in all cases trust is a heuristic decision rule allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning contents  sales and marketing  sociology  psychology  the social identity approach  philosophy  economics  systems  see also  references  further reading  external links sales and marketingedit an analysis of the multiple scholarly writings on the concept of the trust that develops between a seller and a buyer reveals that it rests on four structural variables  affinities or how similar their respective background and culture are  benevolence or the care one takes in the wellbeing of the other  abilities how competent the seller is deemed to be and how wellarticulated the buyer is and  integrity the first two variables are considered to be emotional because they are experienced as such and the last two are considered to be cognitive because they involve some level of rationalization sociologyedit when it comes to trust sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems interest in trust has grown significantly since the early eighties from the early works of luhmann barber  and giddens see  for a more detailed overview this growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by ongoing changes in society characterised as late modernity and postmodernity trust is one of several social constructs an element of the social reality it does not exist outside of our vision of the other this image can be real or imaginary but it is this one which permits the creation of the trust other constructs frequently discussed together with trust are control confidence risk meaning and power trust is naturally attributable to relationships between social actors both individuals and groups social systems because trust is a social construct it is valid to discuss whether trust can be trusted eg ie whether social trust operates as expected society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience and contingency of new possibilities without trust all contingent possibilities should be always considered leading to a paralysis of inaction trust can be seen as a bet on one of contingent futures the one that may deliver benefits once the bet is decided ie trust is granted the trustor suspends his or her disbelief and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all because of it trust acts as a reductor of social complexity allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered or even impossible to consider at all specifically for cooperation sociology tends to focus on two distinct views the macro view of social systems and a micro view of individual social actors where it borders with social psychology similarly views on trust follow this dichotomy therefore on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust the behavioural approach to trust is usually assumed  while actions of social actors are measurable leading to statistical modelling of trust this systemic approach can be contrasted  with studies on social actors and their decisionmaking process in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain and allow to model the emergence of trust sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors and specifically that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency being an attractive alternative to control trust is specifically valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee modern information technologies not only facilitated the transition towards postmodern society but they also challenged traditional views on trust empirical studies  confirms the new approach to the traditional question regarding whether technology artefacts can be attributed with trust trust is not attributable to artefacts but it is a representation of trust in social actors such as designers creators and operators of technology properties of technological artefacts form a message  to determine trustworthiness of those agents the discussion about the impact of information technologies is still in progress however it is worth noting a conceptual rethinking of technologymediated social groups or the proposition of a unifying sociotechnical view on trust from the perspective of social actors psychologyedit in psychology trust is believing that the person who is trusted will do what is expected it starts at the family and grows to others according to the psychoanalyst erik erikson development of basic trust is the first state psychosocial development occurring or failing during the first two years of life success results in feelings of security trust and optimism while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust possibly resulting in attachment disorders a persons dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a personality trait and as such is one of the strongest predictors of subjective wellbeing it has been argued that trust increases subjective wellbeing because it enhances the quality of ones interpersonal relationships and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships trust is integral to the idea of social influence it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting the notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others institutions eg government agencies and objects such as machines however once again perception of honesty competence and value similarity slightly similar to benevolence are essential there are three different forms of trust trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy trustworthiness are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person and trust propensity being able to rely on people once trust is lost by obvious violation of one of these three determinants it is very hard to regain thus there is clear asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust hence being and acting trustworthy should be considered the only sure way to maintain a trust level increasingly much research has been done on the notion of trust and its social implications barbara misztal in her book attempts to combine all notions of trust together she points out three basic things that trust does in the lives of people it makes social life predictable it creates a sense of community and it makes it easier for people to work together in the context of sexual trust riki robbins describes four stages of trust in the context of information theory ed gerck defines and contrasts trust with social functions such as power surveillance and accountability from a social identity perspective the propensity to trust in strangers see ingroup favoritism arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership stereotypes or the need to maintain the groups positive distinctiveness in addition to the social influence in organizational settings trust may have a positive influence on the behaviors perceptions and performances of a person trust has a circular relationship with organizational justice perceptions such that perceived justice leads to trust which in turn promotes future perceptions of justice one factor that enhances trust in a human being is facial resemblance through digital manipulation of facial resemblance in a twoperson sequential trust game supporting evidence was found that having similar facial features facial resemblance enhanced trust in a subject’s respective partner though facial resemblance was shown to increase trust facial resemblance had the effect of decreased sexual desire in a particular partner in a series of tests digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects to be evaluated for attractiveness within the context of a long term or short term relationship the results showed that within the context of a short term relationship which is dependent on sexual desire similar facial features caused a decrease in said desire within the context of a long term relationship which is dependent on trust similar facial features increased the attractiveness of an individual leading one to believe that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships structure often creates trust in a person that encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace working anywhere may be stressful and takes effort by having a conveniently organized area to work on concentration will increase as well as effort structure is not just a method of order it increases trust and therefore makes a workplace manageable a structured ordered environment produces trust as one may contain increased cooperation and perform on a higher level people may work together and achieve success through trust while working on projects that rely on each individual’s contribution conversely where trust is absent projects can fail especially if this lack of trust has not been identified and addressed this is one facet of vpect analysis this thinking framework is used when studying information systems identifying and dealing with cases where information providers information users and those responsible for processing information do not trust one another can result in the removal of a risk factor for a project ones social relationship characterized by low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement are expected to be associated with low academic achievement individuals that are in relationships characterized by high levels of social trust are more apt to openly exchange information and to act with caring benevolence toward one another than those in relationships lacking trust an important key to treating sexual victimization of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child failure for the adults to validate the sexual abuse contributes to the childs difficulty towards trusting self and others trust is often affected by the erosion of a marriagecitation needed children of divorce do not exhibit less trust in mothers partners spouses friends and associates than their peers of intact families the impact of parental divorce is limited to trust in the father the social identity approachedit the social identity approach explains trust in strangers as a function of groupbased stereotypes or ingroup favouring behaviours based on salient group memberships with regard to ingroup favoritism people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from ingroup members in comparison to outgroup members this greater expectation then translates into a higher propensity to trust an ingroup rather than outgroup member it has been pointed out that it is only advantageous to form such expectations of an ingroup stranger if they too know the group membership of the recipient there is considerable empirical activity related to the social identity approach allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand groupbased trust in strangers they may be operationalised as unilateral or bilateral relationships of exchange general social categories such as university affiliation course majors and even adhoc groups have been used to distinguish between ingroup and outgroup members in unilateral studies of trust the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an ingroup or outgroup member they would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction simulating brewer’s notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about groupbased trust and hence cooperation participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out in bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender trusting behaviour on the part of the sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money the above empirical research has demonstrated that when group membership is made salient and known to both parties trust is granted more readily to ingroup members than outgroup members this occurred even when the ingroup stereotype was comparatively less positive than an outgroup’s eg psychology versus nursing majors in the absence of personal identity cues and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money ie in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger in contrast when only the recipient was made aware of group membership trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes the group with the more positive stereotype was trusted eg one’s university affiliation over another even over that of the ingroup eg nursing over psychology majors another reason for ingroup favouring behaviours in trust could be attributed to the need to maintain ingroup positive distinctiveness particularly in the presence of social identity threat it should also be noted that trust in outgroup strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed philosophyedit some philosophers argue that trust is more than a relationship of reliance philosophers such as annette baier have made a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed whilst reliance can only be disappointed baier   carolyn mcleod explains baiers argument by giving the following examples we can rely on our

shock shyness sorrow suffering surprise trust wonder worry v t e trust the artists daughters on the way to school  gustav adolph hennig painting in a social context trust has several connotations definitions of trust typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects one party trustor is willing to rely on the actions of another party trustee the situation is directed to the future in addition the trustor voluntarily or forcedly abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee as a consequence the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the others actions they can only develop and evaluate expectations the uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired vladimir ilych lenin expressed this idea with the sentence trust is good control is better trust can be attributed to relationships between people it can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain some studies indicate that trust can be altered eg by the application of oxytocin conceptually trust is also attributable to relationships within and between social groups history families friends communities organisations companies nations etc it is a popular approach to frame the dynamics of intergroup and intragroup interactions in terms of trust the trust formations of people towards different actors in society has been shaped into a generic model of trust with three levels of application ie macro micro and meso when it comes to the relationship between people and technology the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute the intentional stance demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies however rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artefacts one of the key current challenges in the social sciences is to rethink how the rapid progress of technology has impacted constructs such as trust this is specifically true for information technology that dramatically alters causation in social systems in the social sciences the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research in sociology and psychology the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of belief in the honesty fairness or benevolence of another party the term confidence is more appropriate for a belief in the competence of the other party based on the most recent researchcitation needed a failure in trust may be forgiven more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty in economics trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions in all cases trust is a heuristic decision rule allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning contents  sales and marketing  sociology  psychology  the social identity approach  philosophy  economics  systems  see also  references  further reading  external links sales and marketingedit an analysis of the multiple scholarly writings on the concept of the trust that develops between a seller and a buyer reveals that it rests on four structural variables  affinities or how similar their respective background and culture are  benevolence or the care one takes in the wellbeing of the other  abilities how competent the seller is deemed to be and how wellarticulated the buyer is and  integrity the first two variables are considered to be emotional because they are experienced as such and the last two are considered to be cognitive because they involve some level of rationalization sociologyedit when it comes to trust sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems interest in trust has grown significantly since the early eighties from the early works of luhmann barber  and giddens see  for a more detailed overview this growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by ongoing changes in society characterised as late modernity and postmodernity trust is one of several social constructs an element of the social reality it does not exist outside of our vision of the other this image can be real or imaginary but it is this one which permits the creation of the trust other constructs frequently discussed together with trust are control confidence risk meaning and power trust is naturally attributable to relationships between social actors both individuals and groups social systems because trust is a social construct it is valid to discuss whether trust can be trusted eg ie whether social trust operates as expected society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience and contingency of new possibilities without trust all contingent possibilities should be always considered leading to a paralysis of inaction trust can be seen as a bet on one of contingent futures the one that may deliver benefits once the bet is decided ie trust is granted the trustor suspends his or her disbelief and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all because of it trust acts as a reductor of social complexity allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered or even impossible to consider at all specifically for cooperation sociology tends to focus on two distinct views the macro view of social systems and a micro view of individual social actors where it borders with social psychology similarly views on trust follow this dichotomy therefore on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust the behavioural approach to trust is usually assumed  while actions of social actors are measurable leading to statistical modelling of trust this systemic approach can be contrasted  with studies on social actors and their decisionmaking process in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain and allow to model the emergence of trust sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors and specifically that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency being an attractive alternative to control trust is specifically valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee modern information technologies not only facilitated the transition towards postmodern society but they also challenged traditional views on trust empirical studies  confirms the new approach to the traditional question regarding whether technology artefacts can be attributed with trust trust is not attributable to artefacts but it is a representation of trust in social actors such as designers creators and operators of technology properties of technological artefacts form a message  to determine trustworthiness of those agents the discussion about the impact of information technologies is still in progress however it is worth noting a conceptual rethinking of technologymediated social groups or the proposition of a unifying sociotechnical view on trust from the perspective of social actors psychologyedit in psychology trust is believing that the person who is trusted will do what is expected it starts at the family and grows to others according to the psychoanalyst erik erikson development of basic trust is the first state psychosocial development occurring or failing during the first two years of life success results in feelings of security trust and optimism while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust possibly resulting in attachment disorders a persons dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a personality trait and as such is one of the strongest predictors of subjective wellbeing it has been argued that trust increases subjective wellbeing because it enhances the quality of ones interpersonal relationships and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships trust is integral to the idea of social influence it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting the notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others institutions eg government agencies and objects such as machines however once again perception of honesty competence and value similarity slightly similar to benevolence are essential there are three different forms of trust trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy trustworthiness are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person and trust propensity being able to rely on people once trust is lost by obvious violation of one of these three determinants it is very hard to regain thus there is clear asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust hence being and acting trustworthy should be considered the only sure way to maintain a trust level increasingly much research has been done on the notion of trust and its social implications barbara misztal in her book attempts to combine all notions of trust together she points out three basic things that trust does in the lives of people it makes social life predictable it creates a sense of community and it makes it easier for people to work together in the context of sexual trust riki robbins describes four stages of trust in the context of information theory ed gerck defines and contrasts trust with social functions such as power surveillance and accountability from a social identity perspective the propensity to trust in strangers see ingroup favoritism arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership stereotypes or the need to maintain the groups positive distinctiveness in addition to the social influence in organizational settings trust may have a positive influence on the behaviors perceptions and performances of a person trust has a circular relationship with organizational justice perceptions such that perceived justice leads to trust which in turn promotes future perceptions of justice one factor that enhances trust in a human being is facial resemblance through digital manipulation of facial resemblance in a twoperson sequential trust game supporting evidence was found that having similar facial features facial resemblance enhanced trust in a subject’s respective partner though facial resemblance was shown to increase trust facial resemblance had the effect of decreased sexual desire in a particular partner in a series of tests digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects to be evaluated for attractiveness within the context of a long term or short term relationship the results showed that within the context of a short term relationship which is dependent on sexual desire similar facial features caused a decrease in said desire within the context of a long term relationship which is dependent on trust similar facial features increased the attractiveness of an individual leading one to believe that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships structure often creates trust in a person that encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace working anywhere may be stressful and takes effort by having a conveniently organized area to work on concentration will increase as well as effort structure is not just a method of order it increases trust and therefore makes a workplace manageable a structured ordered environment produces trust as one may contain increased cooperation and perform on a higher level people may work together and achieve success through trust while working on projects that rely on each individual’s contribution conversely where trust is absent projects can fail especially if this lack of trust has not been identified and addressed this is one facet of vpect analysis this thinking framework is used when studying information systems identifying and dealing with cases where information providers information users and those responsible for processing information do not trust one another can result in the removal of a risk factor for a project ones social relationship characterized by low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement are expected to be associated with low academic achievement individuals that are in relationships characterized by high levels of social trust are more apt to openly exchange information and to act with caring benevolence toward one another than those in relationships lacking trust an important key to treating sexual victimization of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child failure for the adults to validate the sexual abuse contributes to the childs difficulty towards trusting self and others trust is often affected by the erosion of a marriagecitation needed children of divorce do not exhibit less trust in mothers partners spouses friends and associates than their peers of intact families the impact of parental divorce is limited to trust in the father the social identity approachedit the social identity approach explains trust in strangers as a function of groupbased stereotypes or ingroup favouring behaviours based on salient group memberships with regard to ingroup favoritism people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from ingroup members in comparison to outgroup members this greater expectation then translates into a higher propensity to trust an ingroup rather than outgroup member it has been pointed out that it is only advantageous to form such expectations of an ingroup stranger if they too know the group membership of the recipient there is considerable empirical activity related to the social identity approach allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand groupbased trust in strangers they may be operationalised as unilateral or bilateral relationships of exchange general social categories such as university affiliation course majors and even adhoc groups have been used to distinguish between ingroup and outgroup members in unilateral studies of trust the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an ingroup or outgroup member they would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction simulating brewer’s notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about groupbased trust and hence cooperation participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out in bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender trusting behaviour on the part of the sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money the above empirical research has demonstrated that when group membership is made salient and known to both parties trust is granted more readily to ingroup members than outgroup members this occurred even when the ingroup stereotype was comparatively less positive than an outgroup’s eg psychology versus nursing majors in the absence of personal identity cues and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money ie in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger in contrast when only the recipient was made aware of group membership trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes the group with the more positive stereotype was trusted eg one’s university affiliation over another even over that of the ingroup eg nursing over psychology majors another reason for ingroup favouring behaviours in trust could be attributed to the need to maintain ingroup positive distinctiveness particularly in the presence of social identity threat it should also be noted that trust in outgroup strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed philosophyedit some philosophers argue that trust is more than a relationship of reliance philosophers such as annette baier have made a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed whilst reliance can only be disappointed baier   carolyn mcleod explains baiers argument by giving the following examples we can rely on our clock to give the time but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks thus we cannot say that we trusted it we are not trusting when we are suspicious of the other person because this is in fact an expression of distrust mcleod  thus trust is different from reliance in the sense that a truster accepts the risk of being betrayed the definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something leads to eliminate the notion of risk from the definition because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable for example to have an expectation of a friend arriving to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years is a confident expectation whether or not we agree with her annoying late arrivals the trust is not about what we wish for rather it is in the consistency of the data of our habits as a result there is no risk or betrayal because the data now exists as collective knowledge economicsedit see also consumer confidence trust in economics is treated as an explanation for a difference between actual human behaviour and the one that can be explained by the individual desire to maximize ones utility in economic terms trust can provide an explanation of a difference between nash equilibrium and the observed equilibrium such an approach can be applied to individuals and well as societies trust is also seen as an economic lubricant reducing the cost of transactions between parties enabling new forms of cooperation and generally furthering business activities employment and prosperity this observation  created a significant interest in considering trust as a form of social capital and has led research into closer understanding of the process of creation and distribution of such capital it has been claimed that higher level of social trust is positively correlated with economic development even though the original concept of high trust and low trust societies may not necessarily hold it has been widely accepted and demonstrated that social trust benefits the economy  and that a low level of trust inhibits economic growth theoretical economical modelling  demonstrated that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to trustworthiness of the other party such a level of trust leads to efficient market trusting less lead to the loss of economic opportunities trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation economics is also interested in quantifying trust usually in monetary terms the level of correlation between increase in profit margin  or decrease in transactional cost can be used as indicators of economic value of trust economic trust games are popularly used to empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions there are several games and gamelike scenarios related to trust that have been tried with certain preferences to those that allow to estimate confidence in monetary terms games of trust are designed in a way that their nash equilibrium differ from pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximise his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation while cooperating partners can benefit the classical version of the game of trust has been described in  as an abstracted investment game using the scenario of an investor and a broker investor can invest a fraction of his money and broker can return only part of his gains if both players follow their economical best interest the investor should never invest and the broker will never be able to repay anything thus the flow of money flow its volume and character is attributable entirely to the existence of trust the game can be played as oneoff or as a repetitive one between the same or different sets of players to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships several other variants of this game exist reversing rules lead to the game of distrust predeclarations can be used to establish intentions of players while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate perception of both players the game can be also played by several players on the closed market with or without information about reputation other interesting games are eg binarychoice trust games the giftexchange game  and various other forms of social games specifically games based on the prisoners dilemma  are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity the work of rachel botsman is also very important about collaboration economy the popularisation of ecommerce opened the discussion of trust in economy to new challenges while at the same time elevating the importance of trust and desire to understand customer decision to trust for example interpersonal relationship between the buyer and the seller has been disintermediated by the technology and had to be improved upon alternatively web sites could be made to convince the buyer to trust the seller regardless of sellers actual trustworthiness eg  reputationbased systems improved on trust assessment by allowing to capture the collective perception of trustworthiness generating significant interest in various models of reputation systemsedit in systems a trusted component has a set of properties which another component can rely on if a trusts b this means that a violation in those properties of b might compromise the correct operation of a observe that those properties of b trusted by a might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to b’s actual properties this happens when the designer of the overall system does not take the relation into account in consequence trust should be placed to the extent of the component’s trustworthiness the trustworthiness of a component is thus not surprisingly defined by how well it secures a set of functional and nonfunctional properties deriving from its architecture construction and environment and evaluated as appropriate see alsoedit attachment theory credulity gullibility intimacy misplaced trust

shock shyness sorrow suffering surprise trust wonder worry v t e trust the artists daughters on the way to school  gustav adolph hennig painting in a social context trust has several connotations definitions of trust typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects one party trustor is willing to rely on the actions of another party trustee the situation is directed to the future in addition the trustor voluntarily or forcedly abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee as a consequence the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the others actions they can only develop and evaluate expectations the uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired vladimir ilych lenin expressed this idea with the sentence trust is good control is better trust can be attributed to relationships between people it can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain some studies indicate that trust can be altered eg by the application of oxytocin conceptually trust is also attributable to relationships within and between social groups history families friends communities organisations companies nations etc it is a popular approach to frame the dynamics of intergroup and intragroup interactions in terms of trust the trust formations of people towards different actors in society has been shaped into a generic model of trust with three levels of application ie macro micro and meso when it comes to the relationship between people and technology the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute the intentional stance demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies however rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artefacts one of the key current challenges in the social sciences is to rethink how the rapid progress of technology has impacted constructs such as trust this is specifically true for information technology that dramatically alters causation in social systems in the social sciences the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research in sociology and psychology the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of belief in the honesty fairness or benevolence of another party the term confidence is more appropriate for a belief in the competence of the other party based on the most recent researchcitation needed a failure in trust may be forgiven more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty in economics trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions in all cases trust is a heuristic decision rule allowing the human to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning contents  sales and marketing  sociology  psychology  the social identity approach  philosophy  economics  systems  see also  references  further reading  external links sales and marketingedit an analysis of the multiple scholarly writings on the concept of the trust that develops between a seller and a buyer reveals that it rests on four structural variables  affinities or how similar their respective background and culture are  benevolence or the care one takes in the wellbeing of the other  abilities how competent the seller is deemed to be and how wellarticulated the buyer is and  integrity the first two variables are considered to be emotional because they are experienced as such and the last two are considered to be cognitive because they involve some level of rationalization sociologyedit when it comes to trust sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems interest in trust has grown significantly since the early eighties from the early works of luhmann barber  and giddens see  for a more detailed overview this growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by ongoing changes in society characterised as late modernity and postmodernity trust is one of several social constructs an element of the social reality it does not exist outside of our vision of the other this image can be real or imaginary but it is this one which permits the creation of the trust other constructs frequently discussed together with trust are control confidence risk meaning and power trust is naturally attributable to relationships between social actors both individuals and groups social systems because trust is a social construct it is valid to discuss whether trust can be trusted eg ie whether social trust operates as expected society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience and contingency of new possibilities without trust all contingent possibilities should be always considered leading to a paralysis of inaction trust can be seen as a bet on one of contingent futures the one that may deliver benefits once the bet is decided ie trust is granted the trustor suspends his or her disbelief and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all because of it trust acts as a reductor of social complexity allowing for actions that are otherwise too complex to be considered or even impossible to consider at all specifically for cooperation sociology tends to focus on two distinct views the macro view of social systems and a micro view of individual social actors where it borders with social psychology similarly views on trust follow this dichotomy therefore on one side the systemic role of trust can be discussed with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust the behavioural approach to trust is usually assumed  while actions of social actors are measurable leading to statistical modelling of trust this systemic approach can be contrasted  with studies on social actors and their decisionmaking process in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain and allow to model the emergence of trust sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors and specifically that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency being an attractive alternative to control trust is specifically valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee modern information technologies not only facilitated the transition towards postmodern society but they also challenged traditional views on trust empirical studies  confirms the new approach to the traditional question regarding whether technology artefacts can be attributed with trust trust is not attributable to artefacts but it is a representation of trust in social actors such as designers creators and operators of technology properties of technological artefacts form a message  to determine trustworthiness of those agents the discussion about the impact of information technologies is still in progress however it is worth noting a conceptual rethinking of technologymediated social groups or the proposition of a unifying sociotechnical view on trust from the perspective of social actors psychologyedit in psychology trust is believing that the person who is trusted will do what is expected it starts at the family and grows to others according to the psychoanalyst erik erikson development of basic trust is the first state psychosocial development occurring or failing during the first two years of life success results in feelings of security trust and optimism while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust possibly resulting in attachment disorders a persons dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a personality trait and as such is one of the strongest predictors of subjective wellbeing it has been argued that trust increases subjective wellbeing because it enhances the quality of ones interpersonal relationships and happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships trust is integral to the idea of social influence it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting the notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others institutions eg government agencies and objects such as machines however once again perception of honesty competence and value similarity slightly similar to benevolence are essential there are three different forms of trust trust is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy trustworthiness are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person and trust propensity being able to rely on people once trust is lost by obvious violation of one of these three determinants it is very hard to regain thus there is clear asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust hence being and acting trustworthy should be considered the only sure way to maintain a trust level increasingly much research has been done on the notion of trust and its social implications barbara misztal in her book attempts to combine all notions of trust together she points out three basic things that trust does in the lives of people it makes social life predictable it creates a sense of community and it makes it easier for people to work together in the context of sexual trust riki robbins describes four stages of trust in the context of information theory ed gerck defines and contrasts trust with social functions such as power surveillance and accountability from a social identity perspective the propensity to trust in strangers see ingroup favoritism arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership stereotypes or the need to maintain the groups positive distinctiveness in addition to the social influence in organizational settings trust may have a positive influence on the behaviors perceptions and performances of a person trust has a circular relationship with organizational justice perceptions such that perceived justice leads to trust which in turn promotes future perceptions of justice one factor that enhances trust in a human being is facial resemblance through digital manipulation of facial resemblance in a twoperson sequential trust game supporting evidence was found that having similar facial features facial resemblance enhanced trust in a subject’s respective partner though facial resemblance was shown to increase trust facial resemblance had the effect of decreased sexual desire in a particular partner in a series of tests digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects to be evaluated for attractiveness within the context of a long term or short term relationship the results showed that within the context of a short term relationship which is dependent on sexual desire similar facial features caused a decrease in said desire within the context of a long term relationship which is dependent on trust similar facial features increased the attractiveness of an individual leading one to believe that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships structure often creates trust in a person that encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace working anywhere may be stressful and takes effort by having a conveniently organized area to work on concentration will increase as well as effort structure is not just a method of order it increases trust and therefore makes a workplace manageable a structured ordered environment produces trust as one may contain increased cooperation and perform on a higher level people may work together and achieve success through trust while working on projects that rely on each individual’s contribution conversely where trust is absent projects can fail especially if this lack of trust has not been identified and addressed this is one facet of vpect analysis this thinking framework is used when studying information systems identifying and dealing with cases where information providers information users and those responsible for processing information do not trust one another can result in the removal of a risk factor for a project ones social relationship characterized by low trust and norms that discourage academic engagement are expected to be associated with low academic achievement individuals that are in relationships characterized by high levels of social trust are more apt to openly exchange information and to act with caring benevolence toward one another than those in relationships lacking trust an important key to treating sexual victimization of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child failure for the adults to validate the sexual abuse contributes to the childs difficulty towards trusting self and others trust is often affected by the erosion of a marriagecitation needed children of divorce do not exhibit less trust in mothers partners spouses friends and associates than their peers of intact families the impact of parental divorce is limited to trust in the father the social identity approachedit the social identity approach explains trust in strangers as a function of groupbased stereotypes or ingroup favouring behaviours based on salient group memberships with regard to ingroup favoritism people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from ingroup members in comparison to outgroup members this greater expectation then translates into a higher propensity to trust an ingroup rather than outgroup member it has been pointed out that it is only advantageous to form such expectations of an ingroup stranger if they too know the group membership of the recipient there is considerable empirical activity related to the social identity approach allocator studies have frequently been employed to understand groupbased trust in strangers they may be operationalised as unilateral or bilateral relationships of exchange general social categories such as university affiliation course majors and even adhoc groups have been used to distinguish between ingroup and outgroup members in unilateral studies of trust the participant would be asked to choose between envelopes containing money that was previously allocated by an ingroup or outgroup member they would have had no prior or future opportunities for interaction simulating brewer’s notion that group membership was sufficient in bringing about groupbased trust and hence cooperation participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out in bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by berg and colleagues where individuals could choose to give a portion or none of their money to another any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide on whether they would return the favour by giving money back to the sender trusting behaviour on the part of the sender and the eventual trustworthiness of the receiver was exemplified through the giving of money the above empirical research has demonstrated that when group membership is made salient and known to both parties trust is granted more readily to ingroup members than outgroup members this occurred even when the ingroup stereotype was comparatively less positive than an outgroup’s eg psychology versus nursing majors in the absence of personal identity cues and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money ie in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger in contrast when only the recipient was made aware of group membership trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes the group with the more positive stereotype was trusted eg one’s university affiliation over another even over that of the ingroup eg nursing over psychology majors another reason for ingroup favouring behaviours in trust could be attributed to the need to maintain ingroup positive distinctiveness particularly in the presence of social identity threat it should also be noted that trust in outgroup strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed philosophyedit some philosophers argue that trust is more than a relationship of reliance philosophers such as annette baier have made a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed whilst reliance can only be disappointed baier   carolyn mcleod explains baiers argument by giving the following examples we can rely on our clock to give the time but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks thus we cannot say that we trusted it we are not trusting when we are suspicious of the other person because this is in fact an expression of distrust mcleod  thus trust is different from reliance in the sense that a truster accepts the risk of being betrayed the definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something leads to eliminate the notion of risk from the definition because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable for example to have an expectation of a friend arriving to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years is a confident expectation whether or not we agree with her annoying late arrivals the trust is not about what we wish for rather it is in the consistency of the data of our habits as a result there is no risk or betrayal because the data now exists as collective knowledge economicsedit see also consumer confidence trust in economics is treated as an explanation for a difference between actual human behaviour and the one that can be explained by the individual desire to maximize ones utility in economic terms trust can provide an explanation of a difference between nash equilibrium and the observed equilibrium such an approach can be applied to individuals and well as societies trust is also seen as an economic lubricant reducing the cost of transactions between parties enabling new forms of cooperation and generally furthering business activities employment and prosperity this observation  created a significant interest in considering trust as a form of social capital and has led research into closer understanding of the process of creation and distribution of such capital it has been claimed that higher level of social trust is positively correlated with economic development even though the original concept of high trust and low trust societies may not necessarily hold it has been widely accepted and demonstrated that social trust benefits the economy  and that a low level of trust inhibits economic growth theoretical economical modelling  demonstrated that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to trustworthiness of the other party such a level of trust leads to efficient market trusting less lead to the loss of economic opportunities trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation economics is also interested in quantifying trust usually in monetary terms the level of correlation between increase in profit margin  or decrease in transactional cost can be used as indicators of economic value of trust economic trust games are popularly used to empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions there are several games and gamelike scenarios related to trust that have been tried with certain preferences to those that allow to estimate confidence in monetary terms games of trust are designed in a way that their nash equilibrium differ from pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximise his own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation while cooperating partners can benefit the classical version of the game of trust has been described in  as an abstracted investment game using the scenario of an investor and a broker investor can invest a fraction of his money and broker can return only part of his gains if both players follow their economical best interest the investor should never invest and the broker will never be able to repay anything thus the flow of money flow its volume and character is attributable entirely to the existence of trust the game can be played as oneoff or as a repetitive one between the same or different sets of players to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships several other variants of this game exist reversing rules lead to the game of distrust predeclarations can be used to establish intentions of players while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate perception of both players the game can be also played by several players on the closed market with or without information about reputation other interesting games are eg binarychoice trust games the giftexchange game  and various other forms of social games specifically games based on the prisoners dilemma  are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity the work of rachel botsman is also very important about collaboration economy the popularisation of ecommerce opened the discussion of trust in economy to new challenges while at the same time elevating the importance of trust and desire to understand customer decision to trust for example interpersonal relationship between the buyer and the seller has been disintermediated by the technology and had to be improved upon alternatively web sites could be made to convince the buyer to trust the seller regardless of sellers actual trustworthiness eg  reputationbased systems improved on trust assessment by allowing to capture the collective perception of trustworthiness generating significant interest in various models of reputation systemsedit in systems a trusted component has a set of properties which another component can rely on if a trusts b this means that a violation in those properties of b might compromise the correct operation of a observe that those properties of b trusted by a might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to b’s actual properties this happens when the designer of the overall system does not take the relation into account in consequence trust should be placed to the extent of the component’s trustworthiness the trustworthiness of a component is thus not surprisingly defined by how well it secures a set of functional and nonfunctional properties deriving from its architecture construction and environment and evaluated as appropriate see alsoedit attachment theory credulity gullibility intimacy misplaced trust

september   – the stenbeck foundation a family foundation established in  by the heirs of swedish industrialist jan stenbeck has made a generous gift of  million to the cancer research institute cri the gift will support the institute’s ovarian cancer research efforts underway within the cri ovarian cancer working group ocwg a program of the cri coordinated cancer initiatives and the cancer vaccine collaborative cvc a joint program of cri and the ludwig institute for cancer research ltd licr according to the terms of the gift  will go to the ocwg to support its efforts to find biological markers that will help doctors diagnose ovarian cancer at earlier stages of the disease and  will support the cvc site at roswell park cancer institute where clinical trials of therapeutic ovarian cancer vaccines are underway sophie stenbeck together with sister cristina and brother max established the stenbeck foundation as a way to combine their extensive philanthropic work and achieve greater impact according to sophie who presently serves as president of the foundation its mission is to honor causes that are close to the siblings’ hearts as well as causes that were important to their parents among the foundation’s main interests are researchbased medical developments primarily in early disease detection the importance of medical research to the stenbeck family is readily understood a heart attack claimed their father’s life at age  in  and four years later their mother merrill lost her battle with ovarian cancer within a year of her diagnosis for our first grant sophie explained in an interview with cri we wanted to choose causes that truly honored our parents for my mother obviously that was an ovarian cancer study right away we felt we wanted to do something that would potentially save lives and prevent others from experiencing what happened to her according to sophie doctors didn’t detect her mother’s cancer until after the disease had already progressed to an advanced stage she underwent aggressive treatments with chemotherapy in an attempt to bring her cancer under control it was very very difficult for me to watch her go through that sophie shared ovarian cancer is called the cancer that whispers because it often has no obvious symptoms until it has progressed to late stages there also currently are no screening tools that are highly reliable and easy to use the disease claims the lives of more than  women each year in the united states when considering which organization to select the stenbeck foundation sought to go beyond the standard approaches to cancer treatment and diagnosis we didn’t want to fund just another trial of some aggressive chemotherapy the family looked for a worthy charity but none seemed to resonate with them then they learned about the cancer research institute and its work in cancer immunology cri immediately felt different from other organizations sophie said cri scientists are developing treatments that work with the body as an interconnected whole that’s very important to me it gave me hope that there are studies like this being done the ovarian cancer working group an international coordinated initiative under the direction of dr kunle odunsi director of gynecologic oncology and coleader of the tumor immunology  immunotherapy program at roswell park cancer institute in buffalo ny aims to provide a molecular and cellular understanding of the immune system’s ability to recognize and destroy ovarian cancer cells with the ultimate goal of developing effective immunotherapies for the disease he and colleagues have recently identified a number of potential biomarkers in ovarian cancer the identified proteins appear to play a critical role in ovarian cancer progression and may be a predictive marker for early detection of the disease dr odunsi also is the principal investigator for the cancer vaccine collaborative clinical trials of ovarian cancer vaccines at roswell park he is working to increase the immunological and clinical potency of these vaccines by testing various delivery mechanisms forms of cancer targets called antigens and the effect of adding various immunological stimulatory molecules to the vaccine data from these trials are shared with the global network of cvc sites and also will help inform cri efforts to develop effective therapeutic vaccines for many other cancer types dr odunsi is incredible sophie said of her meeting in  with him cri executive director jill o’donnelltormey and other cri staff he’s not only passionate about his work but he’s also a true scientist who knows all the patients in his studies she added i trust everyone i met from the cancer research institute they’re all there because they each have a personal connection to their work cancer has somehow struck very close to home for them too media contact brian brewer director of communications cancer research

income tax better or worse free credit report mybankrate open advertisement how a trust is taxed george saenz april    in  taxes advertisement share dear tax talk i am the trustee of a complex trust set up for my son by his great uncle when my son was a year old my uncle died in  the will states that i may pay portions of net income andor principal for educational purposes it also states that when my son turns  i am to distribute half of the trust account to him at age  to distribute half of remaining balance and then at  to distribute the balance of the trust the only income is from dividends interest and any stock gains or losses i am not paying myself a trustee fee so expenses are taxes lawyer fees etc for the years through  the distributable net income or dni was not distributed and the trust paid the taxes do all these years of nondistributed dni now become part of the principal in  my son turned  and half of the trust amount was distributed to him for  tax purposes does that amount include the  dni or is the distributed amount considered all principal is there a way for the trust to still pay the taxes on the dni for  or do i have to pass that on to him on the k do i show the full amount distributed and if so where also some funds were distributed for college expenses — do these amounts also show up as being distributed to him on the k are the only forms to be filed the  and the k — mike dear mike a trust is a separate legal entity for income tax purposes and thus must file its own tax forms a trust that is required to distribute all its income currently is considered a simple trust otherwise the trust is a complex trust a trust figures its income and deductions much in the same way that an individual figures his or her income for tax purposes with one major difference a trust is allowed a deduction for income distributed to beneficiaries the income distribution deduction is figured by completing schedule b of form  the beneficiary not the trust pays the income tax on the taxable amount of the distributions generally if an amount is distributed from a trust that amount is considered to come out of currentyear income first then from accumulated capital or principal accumulated capital would be the original contribution or contributions to the trust plus all subsequent accumulations ie income in excess of distributions current income is figured under the state law applicable to trusts and the trust’s governing document generally the only distinction in accounting income under local law and regular net income would be the treatment of capital gains if you have capital gains you need to determine if they’re taxable to the trust or the beneficiary in  when you distributed half of the trust to your son all the  income will be taxed to him and accordingly you will need to complete a schedule k for him he in turn will include the k amounts on his individual return it is hoped he saved some money for taxes the trust must claim the distribution deduction and pass the tax burden on to the beneficiary the full amount distributed is shown on schedule b and is not required to be shown on the schedule k all amounts distributed to your son or for his benefit are taxable to him to the extent of the trust’s income distribution deduction if you don’t have capital gains or alternative minimum tax differences the two pages of form  and the schedule k would be a complete tax return to ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the irs we inform you that any us federal tax advice contained in this
