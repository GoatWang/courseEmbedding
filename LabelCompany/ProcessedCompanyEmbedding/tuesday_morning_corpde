believe are representative of its core operating performance  this measure is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as a measure of operating performance  in addition adjusted ebitda is not presented as and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under gaap and should not be construed as an inference that the company’s future results will

performance  these nongaap financial measures are included to supplement the company’s financial information presented in accordance with gaap and because the company uses these measures to monitor and evaluate the performance of its business as a supplement to gaap measures and believes the presentation of these nongaap measures enhances investors’ ability to analyze trends in the company’s
