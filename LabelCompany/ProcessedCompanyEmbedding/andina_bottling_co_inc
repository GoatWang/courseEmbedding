operations management case studies  andina bottling andina bottling harvard case solution  analysis andina bottling case solution operations management – case study andina bottling co  for operations management to be effective suggest three areas which need to be focused on and improved to align operations in chile brazil and argentina  marks all areas in the stream of operations are extremely necessary including production area sales area distribution area and logistic area the whole supply chain is connected to each other any bottleneck in these operation processes can hinder business profits and create hurdles in the operations management a company must ensure that it is able to generate and increase the demand for its product for this purpose the sales and marketing area is very important at andina the selling and distribution process started with taking orders the sales force went out daily to take orders from customers which were delivered the next day after going through the whole process of distribution and logistics if the system was made online and orders were made through virtual presence rather than physically meeting every customer then the supply chain would become more efficient and the process can be faster deliveries can be made on the same day it was ordered with the completion of the task of marketing and taking feedback at the time of actual deliveries this will improve the process and operations to a large extent along with a reduction in the lead time the company must also ensure that the supplydemand match is achieved having an oversupply situation can be wasteful and costly whereas undersupply will result in missed opportunity situation as a result potential customers will be lost for this purpose the production department should be closely aligned with the department that generates sales orders usually any inefficiency in gauging the correct demand figure and keeping the safety stock at each level creates the bullwhip effect that is not good for the company because the product will expire in the line with oversupply and production excess becoming evident if the sales department is focused and linked with the production department and  receives timely information then the company will be able to follow pullstrategy rather than pushstrategy for its production this will help to eradicate the bullwhip effect and the number of rejections will also be reduced at the brazilian production similar issue arose because the distribution rejection resulted in increased freight cost of the company although it was because of managers’ unethical practices that the company was paying high cost otherwise the firm could have avoided it if it did not have unaligned system last but not least the timely production and elimination in the bottlenecks of the process line will not matter much if the distribution is not timely proper and costefficient in argentina the unavailability of concrete data from the distribution department created a lag in the company’s operational system and it could not identify that a large number of clients were just resulting in  of sales and distribution costs were increasing highly because of this thus improving the distribution area will benefit the company to achieve operational efficiency    if overall strategy comes from coke what should andina look at as a bottler to achieve operational success  marks the overall strategy does come from the tccc but there are certain things that have to be handled by bottlers firstly fixed assets are owned by bottlers along with the inventory management and credit risks that are passed on to the them by the tccc andina can use these factors in their favour first of all the organization has to improve its marketing and research department the company should be able to estimate demand figures and should adjust the inventory accordingly the proper inventory management can lead them to eliminate much of its operational inefficiency the real time data from customers can be used to estimate inventory levels and the past data trend of the company will help to identify seasonal fluctuations if any if the inventory is properly maintained and optimization level is known then the capacity utilization of fixed assets can be achieved the excess fixed inventory that is causing additional cost with no value addition can be discarded this will help the company to streamline operations and eliminate redundancies in the system one of the most important factors is to manage the credit risk it is crucial because loosened credit policies will result in cash flow mismanagement and tight situations for the organization whereas rigid credit policies will reduce sales and competitors will be able to attract customers through their policies at this point it is evident that the credit management of andina was very poor some customers were never called for the collection while others were visited more than once thus improving the credit collection system will ensure operational success of the company the research department also plays a direct and indirect role in the operational efficiency of the company bottlers have the option to present proposals to the company about certain things like packaging hence if they manage to do a proper research about the needs and wants of the target market then they can present ideas to the management about better advertisement and packaging bottling techniques if the sales of the product increase so will the margin of the bottler because of achieving economies of scale in their plant…… this is just a sample partial case solution please place the order on the website to order your own originally done case solution the solution will also come with a

that all the information reached the headquarters and not just the positive also the same process would used at every subsidiary the manager of the plant in chile could be interchanged with the plant manager in brazil control panel is supposed to be a place where central management in the main office can see what is going on at each subsidiary control panel is there to find any discrepancies or issues in the operations at the subsidiaries it assesses how each division in the subsidiary is performing an example of what control panel can find is the  smaller clients in argentina as one reason for high distribution costs control panel showed the management that distribution costs were high in argentina they investigated this and decided that they needed to start focusing on their larger clients the system and control panel will be successful if they can open all their subsidiaries to it the case talks about how resistant brazil is to this they do not like the idea of someone watching what they are doing they seem very independent and not very fond of suggestions argentina on the other hand embraced the technology chile is below argentina when it comes to embracing the technology but they are still above brazil the managers of each of these subsidiaries needs to trust the system or else their employees will not if the manager does not believe in or follow the new system there is no point in implementing it the success of the new system and control panel are contingent on how well the managers of the subsidiaries embrace it eventually though the managers who do not embrace it will come around or leave and new people will be brought in the system will succeed especially if it does make life easier the main problem in chile is the insurgence of bbrands or cheaper substitutes for cocacola these knockoffs were invading cocacola’s market share in chile they were also causing the market price for a cocacola to drop to counter the bbrands chile introduced a low
