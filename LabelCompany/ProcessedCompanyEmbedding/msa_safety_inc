manufacturer of safety products was rescued by strong sales to the fire safety market matthew dilallo tmfmd oct   at am msa safety nysemsa is facing three very stiff headwinds from the strong dollar along with weaknesses in emerging and energy markets pushing against business growth while each put downward pressure on revenue and earnings in the third quarter the company was able to overcome much of this pressure thanks to a revolutionary new product that product the g scba pushed sales in its breathing apparatus segment up more than  over last years third quarter helping it to eke out single digit yearoveryear growth in adjusted earnings msa safetys results the raw numbers   q  actuals q  actuals growth yoy revenue  million  million  adjusted earnings  million  million  adjusted eps    data source msa safety what happened with msa safety this quarter even with a trio of challenges msa safety delivered fairly solid results while revenue was down  on a reported basis on a constant currency basis revenue increased  year over year this shows just how strongly foreign currency fluctuations are blowing against msa safety the big driver of course were sales of its new g scba which pushed sales of within the breathing apparatus segment up  year over year on a constant currency basis driven by a  sales increase in north america  the backlog of future sales within the breathing apparatus segment also remained strong at  million however on a net basis the backlog is down  million sequentially also strong were sales within the companys fire and rescue helmet segment which were up  worldwide again on a constant currency basis the rest of the companys segments were under pressure due to weaknesses in emerging markets particularly china and brazil as well as continued weakness in sales to energyrelated customers what management had to say ceo william lambert noted this pressure in his commentary on the quarter in the companys earnings press release according to him the third quarter presented us with several challenges including a stronger us dollar softer business conditions in emerging markets and continued weakness in the energy market despite these headwinds the results we continue to see in the fire service market provide a sense of optimism in an otherwise challenging macro environment sales to the fire service market really rescued msa safety this quarter with those customers driving both breathing apparatus and fire and rescue helmet segment sales msa safety isnt the company seeing its sales rescued by the fire service market honeywell nysehon noted on its thirdquarter conference call that it saw a good performance in its security and fire segment which helped push energy safety and security sales up  on a core organic basis furthermore honeywell cfo tom szlosek commented on the call that its security and fire business is well positioned for continued growth due in part to positive fire service market conditions looking forward msa safety expects the impact from currencies emerging markets and energy to last into  because of this it is now undergoing a restructuring to reduce its costs by  million next year these steps to pare down its cost structure will position the company to better weather the weakness ahead while still positioning it to capture growth over the long term in the near term that growth will likely continue to be driven by the fire service market where like honeywell it is banking on strong sales growth to persist  matt dilallo has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and
