support news  blog customers partners company resources products solutions inmemory data grids inmemory computing try for free products solutions inmemory data grids inmemory computing operational intelligence support news  blog customers partners company resources try for free solutions operational intelligence for the internet of things the internet of things is growing exponentially— and so is the need for operational intelligence operational intelligence for a waterfall of sensor data the internet of things iot refers to embedding sensors computing and connectivity in many of our everyday devices such as thermostats lighting cameras and appliances this opens the door to an unprecedented level of automation and personalization however without a scalable way to track and analyze all of the data being produced these benefits cannot be fully realized “by  the iot will have expanded … to a population of about  billion units” – gartner inmemory computing meets the challenge by simultaneously tracking millions of intelligent devices and analyzing telemetry in real time this provides the operational intelligence required to react to changing patterns optimize behavior and head off impending problems operational intelligence unlocks the power of the iot it’s not just devices the iot includes more than intelligent devices in the home machines on a manufacturing floor a fleet of rental cars or trucks and even a windmill farm benefit from operational intelligence inmemory computing a perfect fit for the iot with its ability to quickly update data analyze it in parallel and run in live missioncritical environments scaleout’s inmemory computing provides an ideal computing platform for the iot how inmemory computing enables the iot analytics strategies that focus on analyzing static data such as last week’s machine logs can help identify long term trends but they cannot react fast enough to capture business opportunities in the moment the iot needs realtime analytics that can track live continuouslyupdated data with extremely low latency the secret sauce that makes this possible is inmemory computing this technology has been used for more than a decade to store and update large fastchanging data sets such as shopping carts and financial data more recently scaleout software introduced scalable inmemory computing capabilities to give this computing platform the horsepower needed to rapidly analyze live data and provide immediate feedback for example scaleout computeserver can analyze a terabyte of continuously changing data in a few seconds or less as illustrated in the following diagram scaleout computeserver’s inmemory data grid tracks realtime state changes generated by an array of intelligent devices and maintains an inmemory representation of the state of these devices enriched by historical information held on disk it then uses dataparallel analytics to look for patterns and generate realtime feedback as required providing operational intelligence using inmemory computing to analyze data from the iot the possibilities are endless the use of operational intelligence with the internet of things has countless possibilities imagine a commercial food processor that streams sensor updates from its machines into a realtime analytics cluster to predict and avoid failure scenarios a rental car company can use operational intelligence to track vehicles look for lost or erratic drivers and anticipate deviations from safe practices a brickandmortar retailer can improve its competitive edge by using operational intelligence to precisely track rfid tags attached to inventory and thereby lower costs while enhancing the customer’s shopping experience in short operational intelligence gives companies the means to leverage the fastchanging data created by the iot and it empowers them to optimize business processes and grow profits so what are some examples of operational intelligence being used in the iot imagine a commercial food processor that streams sensor updates off of its machines into realtime analytics cluster to instantly predict failure scenarios or imagine a large cable provider analyzing user data coming off of set top boxes in realtime and delivering content recommendations immediately based on that analysis finally imagine a bricknmortar retailer — competing with ecommerce — using operational intelligence to combine a consumer’s location with her shopping history to deliver a personalized shopping experience a sales associate armed with a tablet could discover the consumer’s preferences sizes etc before they’ve interacted in short operational intelligence gives companies the means to leverage the fastchanging data created by the iot and it empowers them to enhance the customer experience optimize business processes and grow profits try scaleout for free use the power of inmemory computing in minutes on windows or linux try for free not ready to download

source code available proven solution unmatched developer support   the extremedb embedded database featurebyfeature core inmemory database system imds design as an inmemory database system imds extremedb gives your application speed without rewrites or expensive new hardware it eliminates disk and file io cache management and other sources of latency by working with data directly in main memory extremedb avoids the overhead of data duplication and transfer inherent in diskbased dbmss databases can be created in shared memory enabling concurrent access by multiple processes read about the performance advantages of imds technology in the white papers offered from this site tiny footprint approximately k small code size and minimal overhead database system memory footprint is as small as  of managed data volume means less ram is required extremedb’s streamlined design permits a lower cost cpu as a result your design can use less expensive hardware resulting in lower manufacturing costs or use the extra cpu speed to offer a snappier user experience than your competition and use the extra memory to manage more data at the same cost as competing products optional ondisk or hybrid storage in addition to the core extremedb inmemory data storage mcobjects extremedb fusion edition adds hybrid storage certain record types can be designated for ondisk storage with flexible caching choose the best storage medium based on performance persistence cost and form factor   high availability and clustering committed to  uptime or better extremedb high availability ha edition ensures continuous database operation even in the face of hardware or software failure extremedb ha supports both synchronous safe and asynchronous safe replication with automatic failover in distributed architectures based on extremedb cluster every database instance serves as a master any process on any node can update its local database and cluster efficiently replicates changes to other nodes clustering can dramatically increase available net processing power lower system expansion costs by enabling use of lowcost “commodity” hardware and maximize scalability and reliability for dataintensive applications acid transactions extremedb’s transactions support the acid atomic consistent isolated and durable principles which safeguard data integrity by guaranteeing that updates will complete together or the database will roll back to a pretransaction state extremedb also enables the developer to prioritize transactions bit support the bit edition of extremedb scales to support databases that are terabytes in size to address the realtime database needs of financial social network objectcaching and other highly scalable applications in a published benchmark test an extremedb database grew to  terabytes and  billion rows with no apparent limits on it scaling further performance remained consistent as the database size increased suggesting nearly linear scalability for a simple select against the fully populated database extremedb processed  million query transactions per second using its native application programming interface api and  million transactions per second using a sql odbc api multiversion concurrency control mvcc another important tool for scalability is extremedbs optional multiversion concurrency control mvcc transaction manager which is available as an alternative to the pessimistic database locking of the original extremedb mursiw multiple reader single writer transaction manager mvcc can dramatically improve scalability and performance especially in applications with ondisk or hybrid inmemory and ondisk database storage many tasks or processes concurrently modifying the database versus readonly and in multicore systems transaction logging extremedb transaction logging edition adds recoverability by writing database changes into a transaction log on persistent media logging may be set to different levels of transaction durability allowing system designers to make intelligent tradeoffs between performance and risk of unrecoverable transactions open replication mcobjects extremedb data relay technology facilitates seamless finegrained data sharing between realtime systems based on extremedb and external systems such as enterprise dbmss as part of the extremedb transaction logging edition data relay helps developers by simplifying the code that “looks inside” database transactions for changes that should be relayed it also guarantees maximum efficiency by eliminating the cpuintensive task of monitoring database activity sharing of data can be either synchronous or asynchronous cache prioritization extremedb fusion improves on typical least recently used lru cache policies by allowing applications to influence how long certain pages remain in cache to minimize retrieval overhead for objects used in timesensitive tasks when considering whether to remove a page from the cache extremedbs lru algorithm examines the cache priority property set for the page the higher the priority the longer the page remains linked to the lru list stays in cache a caching priority of zero is the default event notifications similar to triggers in a relational database management system this feature enables extremedb to notify an application when something of interest in the database changes it is available in synchronous and asynchronous modes deterministic rulebased sql optimizer costbased sql optimizers must collect sample data generate statistics and analyze thousands  sometimes hundreds of thousands  of possible execution plans these requirements make costbased optimizers operation cpuintensive and unpredictable in contrast extremesql extremedbs sql interface uses a highly efficient and predictable rulebased optimizer pattern search for flexibility in querying extremedb supports the use of wildcards to search tree index entries for single and multiple character matches security features extremedb protects your database cyclic redundancy check crc on the database page level detects whether unauthorized modification to stored data has occurred while rc encryption employs a userprovided cipher to prevent access or tampering in addition to safeguarding sensitive data in financial or defense systems for example pagelevel crc can be used in devices such as portable audio players to help enforce digital rights management binary schema evolution extremedb can save a database as a binary image and then restore it with a changed schema this can accomplish design changes more quickly using less memory and storage than the alternative approach using xml importexport remote procedure calls rpcs extremedb generates an interface that enables remote processes ie on another network node to readupdate an extremedb database database stripingmirroring extremedb fusion can exploit multidisk solid state or spinning configurations with its support for raidlike data striping and data mirroring striping accelerates performance when working with two or more disks by parallelizing access to data mirroring provides continuous backup by replicating data onto separate disks if disk a fails identical records are available from disk b xml importexport extremedbs schema compiler mcocomp can generate xml interface functions for each class providing the means to retrieve an object encoded as xml to create or replace update an object in the database from the content of an xml string to generate the xml schema for each class in the database in order to facilitate sharing data with other xmlenabled systems and to accomplish simple extremedb schema evolution kernel mode deployment mcobject pioneered the concept of an inmemory database that deploys in the operating system kernel extremedb kernel mode leverages the high priority zerolatency responsiveness afforded to kernel tasks—and meets the data sorting access and retrieval needs of applications that place key functions there cc sql java apis extremedb provides the developer with multiple application programming interfaces apis access extremedb using a fast native navigational api consisting of cc functions this is provided as both a typesafe and intuitive applicationspecific api functions are generated based on the data design and as a uniform data access uda api for a consistent interface across all projects extremedb’s sql implementation includes an odbc api for interoperability a more succinct and easier to use proprietary api and a type  version  jdbc driver extremedb’s java native interface jni and c native interface offer the fastest possible dbms solutions in these languages and the ability to access extremedb while working entirely with plain old java and c objects designed to prevent database corruption the extremedb native api is typesafe errors in datatyping are caught at compile time to eliminate database corruption in addition the extremedb runtime implements many verification traps and consistency checks after application debugging the optimized version of the extremedb runtime can be used removing traps and internal checks and restoring valuable clock cycles in addition cyclic redundancy check is built into the backupandrestore feature for inmemory databases executing automatically when a file is loaded to ensure the database was written in its entirety when saved and has not been corrupted btree rtree patricia trie kdtree and hash indexes extremedb provides a wide range of database indexes to boost application performance and minimize footprint extremedb offers rtrees for geospatial data patricia tries for iptelecom kdtrees for multidimensional data and querybyexample qbe btrees hash indexes and more for inmemory databases rather than storing duplicate data indexes contain only a reference to data keeping memory requirements to an absolute minimum wide range of supported data types extremedb supports a wide range of data types  including structures arrays vectors and blobs  for maximum coding efficiency data can be stored in the same complex form in which it is used in the application or as normalized relations custom collations extremedb includes hooks that enable developers to provide a desired character sorting sequence collation for data stored as text including collation that supports a particular language or combination of languages a single application can support search and other textprocessing functions in multiple languages broad platform support extremedb operates on multiple platforms including all major server and realtime operating systems rtoss and can even run without an os in bare bones boards configurations it is designed to minimize reliance on osspecific features in order to simplify the task of porting to new operating systems source code available available source code provides the ultimate transparency for developers using

operational intelligence for the internet of things the internet of things is growing exponentially— and so is the need for operational intelligence operational intelligence for a waterfall of sensor data the internet of things iot refers to embedding sensors computing and connectivity in many of our everyday devices such as thermostats lighting cameras and appliances this opens the door to an unprecedented level of automation and personalization however without a scalable way to track and analyze all of the data being produced these benefits cannot be fully realized “by  the iot will have expanded … to a population of about  billion units” – gartner inmemory computing meets the challenge by simultaneously tracking millions of intelligent devices and analyzing telemetry in real time this provides the operational intelligence required to react to changing patterns optimize behavior and head off impending problems operational intelligence unlocks the power of the iot it’s not just devices the iot includes more than intelligent devices in the home machines on a manufacturing floor a fleet of rental cars or trucks and even a windmill farm benefit from operational intelligence inmemory computing a perfect fit for the iot with its ability to quickly update data analyze it in parallel and run in live missioncritical environments scaleout’s inmemory computing provides an ideal computing platform for the iot how inmemory computing enables the iot analytics strategies that focus on analyzing static data such as last week’s machine logs can help identify long term trends but they cannot react fast enough to capture business opportunities in the moment the iot needs realtime analytics that can track live continuouslyupdated data with extremely low latency the secret sauce that makes this possible is inmemory computing this technology has been used for more than a decade to store and update large fastchanging data sets such as shopping carts and financial data more recently scaleout software introduced scalable inmemory computing capabilities to give this computing platform the horsepower needed to rapidly analyze live data and provide immediate feedback for example scaleout computeserver can analyze a terabyte of continuously changing data in a few seconds or less as illustrated in the following diagram scaleout computeserver’s inmemory data grid tracks realtime state changes generated by an array of intelligent devices and maintains an inmemory representation of the state of these devices enriched by historical information held on disk it then uses dataparallel analytics to look for patterns and generate realtime feedback as required providing operational intelligence using inmemory computing to analyze data from the iot the possibilities are endless the use of operational intelligence with the internet of things has countless possibilities imagine a commercial food processor that streams sensor updates from its machines into a realtime analytics cluster to predict and avoid failure scenarios a rental car company can use operational intelligence to track vehicles look for lost or erratic drivers and anticipate deviations from safe practices a brickandmortar retailer can improve its competitive edge by using operational intelligence to precisely track rfid tags attached to inventory and thereby lower costs while enhancing the customer’s shopping experience in short operational intelligence gives companies the means to leverage the fastchanging data created by the iot and it empowers them to optimize business processes and grow profits so what are some examples of operational intelligence being used in the iot imagine a commercial food processor that streams sensor updates off of its machines into realtime analytics cluster to instantly predict failure scenarios or imagine a large cable provider analyzing user data coming off of set top boxes in realtime and delivering content recommendations immediately based on that analysis finally imagine a bricknmortar retailer — competing with ecommerce — using operational intelligence to combine a consumer’s location with her shopping history to deliver a personalized shopping experience a sales associate armed with a tablet could discover the consumer’s preferences sizes etc before they’ve interacted in short operational intelligence gives companies the means to leverage the fastchanging data created by the iot and it empowers them to enhance the customer experience optimize business processes and grow profits try scaleout for free use the power of inmemory

hardware or software failure extremedb ha supports both synchronous safe and asynchronous safe replication with automatic failover in distributed architectures based on extremedb cluster every database instance serves as a master any process on any node can update its local database and cluster efficiently replicates changes to other nodes clustering can dramatically increase available net processing power lower system expansion costs by enabling use of lowcost “commodity” hardware and maximize scalability and reliability for dataintensive applications acid transactions extremedb’s transactions support the acid atomic consistent isolated and durable principles which safeguard data integrity by guaranteeing that updates will complete together or the database will roll back to a pretransaction state extremedb also enables the developer to prioritize transactions bit support the bit edition of extremedb scales to support databases that are terabytes in size to address the realtime database needs of financial social network objectcaching and other highly scalable applications in a published benchmark test an extremedb database grew to  terabytes and  billion rows with no apparent limits on it scaling further performance remained consistent as the database size increased suggesting nearly linear scalability for a simple select against the fully populated database extremedb processed  million query transactions per second using its native application programming interface api and  million transactions per second using a sql odbc api multiversion concurrency control mvcc another important tool for scalability is extremedbs optional multiversion concurrency control mvcc transaction manager which is available as an alternative to the pessimistic database locking of the original extremedb mursiw multiple reader single writer transaction manager mvcc can dramatically improve scalability and performance especially in applications with ondisk or hybrid inmemory and ondisk database storage many tasks or processes concurrently modifying the database versus readonly and in multicore systems transaction logging extremedb transaction logging edition adds recoverability by writing database changes into a transaction log on persistent media logging may be set to different levels of transaction durability allowing system designers to make intelligent tradeoffs between performance and risk of unrecoverable transactions open replication mcobjects extremedb data relay technology facilitates seamless finegrained data sharing between realtime systems based on extremedb and external systems such as enterprise dbmss as part of the extremedb transaction logging edition data relay helps developers by simplifying the code that “looks inside” database transactions for changes that should be relayed it also guarantees maximum efficiency by eliminating the cpuintensive task of monitoring database activity sharing of data can be either synchronous or asynchronous cache prioritization extremedb fusion improves on typical least recently used lru cache policies by allowing applications to influence how long certain pages remain in cache to minimize retrieval overhead for objects used in timesensitive tasks when considering whether to remove a page from the cache extremedbs lru algorithm examines the cache priority property set for the page the higher the priority the longer the page remains linked to the lru list stays in cache a caching priority of zero is the default event notifications similar to triggers in a relational database management system this feature enables extremedb to notify an application when something of interest in the database changes it is available in synchronous and asynchronous modes deterministic rulebased sql optimizer costbased sql optimizers must collect sample data generate statistics and analyze thousands  sometimes hundreds of thousands  of possible execution plans these requirements make costbased optimizers operation cpuintensive and unpredictable in contrast extremesql extremedbs sql interface uses a highly efficient and predictable rulebased optimizer pattern search for flexibility in querying extremedb supports the use of wildcards to search tree index entries for single and multiple character matches security features extremedb protects your database cyclic redundancy check crc on the database page level detects whether unauthorized modification to stored data has occurred while rc encryption employs a userprovided cipher to prevent access or tampering in addition to safeguarding sensitive data in financial or defense systems for example pagelevel crc can be used in devices such as portable audio players to help enforce digital rights management binary schema evolution extremedb can save a database as a binary image and then restore it with a changed schema this can accomplish design changes more quickly using less memory and storage than the alternative approach using xml importexport remote procedure calls rpcs extremedb generates an interface that enables remote processes ie on another network node to readupdate an extremedb database database stripingmirroring extremedb fusion can exploit multidisk solid state or spinning configurations with its support for raidlike data striping and data mirroring striping accelerates performance when working with two or more disks by parallelizing access to data mirroring provides continuous backup by replicating data onto separate disks if disk a fails identical records are available from disk b xml importexport extremedbs schema compiler mcocomp can generate xml interface functions for each class providing the means to retrieve an object encoded as xml to create or replace update an object in the database from the content of an xml string to generate the xml schema for each class in the database in order to facilitate sharing data with other xmlenabled systems and to accomplish simple extremedb schema evolution kernel mode deployment mcobject pioneered the concept of an inmemory database that deploys in the operating system kernel extremedb kernel mode leverages the high priority zerolatency responsiveness afforded to kernel tasks—and meets the data sorting access and retrieval needs of applications that place key functions there cc sql java apis extremedb provides the developer with multiple application programming interfaces apis access extremedb using a fast native navigational api consisting of cc functions this is provided as both a typesafe and intuitive applicationspecific api functions are generated based on the data design and as a uniform data access uda api for a consistent interface across all projects extremedb’s sql implementation includes an odbc api for interoperability a more succinct and easier to use proprietary api and a type  version  jdbc driver extremedb’s java native interface jni and c native interface offer the fastest possible dbms solutions in these languages and the ability to access extremedb while working entirely with plain old java and c objects designed to prevent database corruption the extremedb native api is typesafe errors in datatyping are caught at compile time to eliminate database corruption in addition the extremedb runtime implements many verification traps and consistency checks after application debugging the optimized version of the extremedb runtime can be used removing traps and internal checks and restoring valuable clock cycles in addition cyclic redundancy check is built into the backupandrestore feature for inmemory databases executing automatically when a file is loaded to ensure the database was written in its entirety when saved and has not been corrupted btree rtree patricia trie kdtree and hash indexes extremedb provides a wide range of database indexes to boost application performance and minimize footprint extremedb offers rtrees for geospatial data patricia tries for iptelecom kdtrees for multidimensional data and querybyexample qbe btrees hash indexes and more for inmemory databases rather than storing duplicate data indexes contain only a reference to data keeping memory requirements to an absolute minimum wide range of supported data types extremedb supports a wide range of data types  including structures arrays vectors and blobs  for maximum coding efficiency data can be stored in the same complex form in which it is used in the application or as normalized relations custom collations extremedb includes hooks that enable developers to provide a desired character sorting sequence collation for data stored as text including collation that supports a particular language or combination of languages a single application can support search and other textprocessing functions in multiple languages broad platform support extremedb operates on multiple platforms including all major server and realtime operating systems rtoss and can even run without an os in bare bones boards configurations it is designed to minimize reliance on osspecific features in order to simplify the task of porting to new operating systems source code
