average annualized rate of about  during the past five years however the company’s most recent quarter increase of  looks attractive the sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share sps has grown over a specific period of time it tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues the sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growthorientation is for a stock or portfolio ball corporation achieves belowaverage profit margin the best measure of a company is its profitability for without it it cannot grow and if it

profits into returns ball corporation bll’s roe is  while industry’s is  the average roe for the sector stands at  the return on equity roe also known as return on investment roi is the best measure of the return since it is the product of the operating performance asset turnover and debtequity management of the firm if a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity ball corporation’s roa is  while industry’s average is  as with any return the higher this

stock a buy now solid dividend growth opportunities aggressive management  whats not to like michael douglass tmfenterprise apr   at am source istock with a plus dividend a focus on groceryanchored shopping centers everyone needs groceries right and plenty of growth opportunity retail opportunity investments corp nasdaqroic has plenty going for it its worth a second look anyway but as we dig deeper the key question is simple is the stock a buy now at these prices strategyroics portfolio is anchored in highquality west coast assets management concentrates on topoftheline properties in or near big population centers think la portland and seattle roics portfolio is heavily focused in highnetworth areas within these larger markets which gives its tenants access to customers with an attractive demographic profile roic tends to own whole shopping centers instead of individual standalone buildings a holistic shopping centerbased strategy gives roic a powerful lever that if used correctly can catalyze tremendous growth to its rents across the board by increasing the rent in individual spaces over time it can gradually improve its tenant profile  thereby creating a virtuous cycle of tenant and rent upgrades  ill let coo richard schoebel explain it a bit better in this quote from roics q  earnings call all quotes come from sp global market intelligence just to give you a quick example one of our shopping centers in northern california we recaptured an underperforming anchor space that were replaced with a much stronger supermarket operator additionally capitalizing on this new grocery as a draw we recently signed  new anchor leases at the property roic leverages that new tenant to draw in other more attractive tenants  setting off a domino effect of better tenants and escalating rents leading to more money up front for the reit and a shopping center increasingly filled with tenants that roics affluent demographic finds most attractive that should lead to increased foot traffic enabling tenants to make even more money and ultimately lead to even more rent increases its a winwinwin across the board so long as roic is careful and disciplined in where it targets these adjustments always carefully balancing them against the need to keep space filled and the cash flow coming in of course with a portfolio currently  leased  and with  of that particularly important anchor space leased  its clear that management is keeping a very good balance thus far potential problemslike all reits roic uses debt to acquire new properties and is sensitive to interest rate increases the federal reserve plans to raise rates twice this year so thats a potential issue if the cost of borrowing increases its tougher to find profitable acquisitions and more money gets eaten up by current interest payments if the debt is floatingrate yet roic has done good work to lessen the potential pain at the end of  roic had roughly  million in debt of which  million was floatingrate and therefore could become more expensive to the company if interest rates increase but the company is already responding proactively having converted  million of that  million to fixedrate loans since the beginning of  another issue is roics geographic concentration it offers one product in one area  shopping centers on the us west coast its dependent not just on national economic factors but also on factors that could be specific to the west coast and while roic has done well in navigating current challenges  in its most recent call schoebel said a recent minimumwage increase had no impact on the rent that tenants are willing to pay  potential macro problems shouldnt be discounted lets talk numbersroic trades at about  times s funds from operations ffo – a supplementary measure reits use to measure their net income once they zero out certain noncash expenses such as depreciation thats cheaper than larger retail reits such as realty income which trades at roughly  times  ffo and national retail properties trading at  times  ffo it also probably reflects some of the perceived risk of geographic concentration roic has so shares are arguably well rather cheap management just boosted roics already solid  annual dividend by  for  reflecting confidence in the business growth prospects at the midpoint of  guidance the dividend would eat up about  of ffo which looks pretty safe anything above  is a bit suspect so all appears well on that end too so is it a buyreasonable valuation check safe dividend check good business model check management

intangibles anchor lease termination fees net of contractual amounts and expense and recovery adjustments related to prior periodsnongaap disclosuresfunds from operations “ffo” is a widely recognized nongaap financial measure for reits that the company believes when considered with financial statements presented in accordance with gaap provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance  ffo is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of reits most of which present ffo along with net income as calculated in accordance with gaap  the company computes ffo in accordance with the “white paper” on ffo published by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” which defines ffo as net income attributable to common stockholders determined in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring sales of depreciable property and impairments plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint venturesthe company uses cash net operating income “noi” internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company’s properties  the company believes cash noi provides useful information to investors regarding the company’s financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and when compared across periods can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company’s properties as this measure is not affected by the noncash revenue and expense recognition items the cost of the company’s funding the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to the company’s ownership of properties  the company believes the exclusion of these items from operating income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the company’s properties as well as trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs  cash noi is a measure of the operating performance of the company’s properties but does not measure the company’s performance as a whole and is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with gaap  the company defines cash noi as operating revenues base rent and recoveries from tenants less property and related expenses property operating expenses and property taxes adjusted for noncash revenue and operating expense items such as straightline rent and amortization of lease intangibles
