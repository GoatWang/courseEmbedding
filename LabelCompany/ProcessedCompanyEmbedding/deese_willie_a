 yentzen    a history of the earnest grant deese and willie dell deese family by w tblock earnest grant deese was born in in alabama on october   his father john wesley deese and his mother mary ann grant deese owned turpentine stills land and a general mercantile store in extreme south central alabama covington and coffee counties john w deese who grew up an orphan on the frontier had no opportunity to attend school as a boy and eventually he employed many people both blacks and whites in his business enterprises because he had to depend on a ruthless bookkeeper to administer his finances john deese suffered heavily from embezzlement the bookkeeper stealing from his employer one family tradition held that when race troubles developed in john deese neighborhood a hardworking kind negro whom deese knew to be innocent of any wrong doing was being hunted by a lynch mob deese gave the black man food and money and then dipped his shoes in turpentine so the blood hounds could not track him the negro made good his escape in  earnest deese parents sold their store land and dwellings in alabama and then moved by train with their furniture livestock equipment and married children to carriere pearl river county mississippi being unable to lease or buy timber lands in that area of mississippi the deese family were soon reduced to sharecropping one by one the remaining children left home until only earnest was left to plow the fields and care for the livestock as well as his aging parents because of that he could only go to school a halfday at a time but he nevertheless succeeded in finishing the eleventh and twelfth grades in one year for a while he worked in a nursery for ten cents an hour until he saved enough money to enter and graduate from soule business college in new orleans where he studied bookkeeping and banking on august   earnest deese married willie dell watson of mcneill mississippi the daughter of david hubert watson and emeline spiers eventually the d h watson family would also move to nederland texas where they resided at  helena for many years prior to their deaths the year  was not particularly a good year to marry and start a family anywhere in this country it being in the utter depths of the great depression but especially so in south mississippi most jobs there were only temporary lasting perhaps a few weeks and many men had to go out of state to seek employment earnest deese worked for a while as bookkeeper for wiggins pickling company later he worked for the w p a works progress administration a federal

on this trip earnest ended up in nederland texas where he stayed with willie dells cousin myrtle and morris green earnest deese got a temporary job working shutdowns at pure oil company now unocal for
