lymphopoiesis culture system pipeline news  publications news publications contact isp™ technology the therapeutic objective enabled by immune system programming isp™ technology is to produce longlived plasma cells from a patient’s b cells that replace missing or defective enzymesproteins to cure serious disease the figure below shows the steps involved in using an isp™based therapeutic regimen steps the initial step involves collecting a patient’s b cells from a simple blood draw using a well established laboratory once isolated the patient’s bcells are electroporated with dna containing that encodes for a missingdefective protein responsible for the disease condition the therapeutic gene is inserted into the patient’s cells as a large plasmid which includes the sb transposon system – the molecular machinery to integrate the gene into the cellular dna selected isp™ modified b cells are expanded ex vivo in our proprietary lymphophesis culture systems the cell population is subsequently induced ex vivo in the culture system to differentiate into plasmablasts and plasma cells – termed isp™ cells the culture system yields a large population of isp™ cells instructed to produce the desired therapeutic protein longlived plasma cells provide a lifetime of immunity against pathogens and have robust protein production capabilities this cell type naturally homes to survival niches in the bone marrow where they become longlived and actively secrete protein for extended periods bellicum pharmaceuticals have developed the icasp™ suicide gene system that can be added to isp™ cells allowing for rapid in vivo elimination if the cell therapy should no longer be needed or desired immusoft’s isp technology offers several advantages over viral gene delivery approaches the dna plasmid construct can be readily optimized to contain the correct gene payload and produced in large quantities that are sufficient for therapeutic use viral transfection methods are not as efficient and require large quantities of purified virus which can be difficult to produce in contrast to viral injections isp treatments are not subject to immune clearance thus repeat ‘dosing’ can be contemplated the proprietary isp transposonbased gene delivery platform can be readily adapted to express any therapeutic protein and used directly to modify a patient’s bcells via standard cell transfection methods like electroporation there is no need to optimize a viral gene delivery vehicle though pseudotyping or other methodology to enhance its efficiency of infecting key cell types immusoft has conducted several proofofconcept studies of the isp system in one of these studies in collaboration with seattle biomedical research institute b cells were isolated from the blood of a healthy human donor and successfully modified to produce the desired proteins – in this case antibodies against hiv references singh h huls h kebriaei p cooper ljn a new approach to gene

a factor viii deficiency hemophilia a and hemophilia b are xlinked genetic disorders that are caused by defective or deficient coagulation factor viii and ix respectively resulting in the inability to form blood clots and sustained bleeding after trauma or injury recombinant clotting factor protein is currently used to treat hemophilia at a high cost per patient  as a therapeutic approach for hemophilia gene transfer has the potential to provide more consistent levels of circulating clotting factor over an extended period of time for more costeffective treatment  moreover only modest levels of fviii or fix expression  of normal can improve clinical outcomes we are using the sleeping beauty sb transposon system to engineer autologous human b cells for secretion of clotting factors as a cellular therapy for hemophilia  an in vitro system for expansion and differentiation of memory b cells into plasma cells has been developed  plasma cells are suitable for sustained delivery of fviii or fix since they secrete high levels of protein and may survive for years in vivo  for human fix expression we assembled an sb transposon with the human fix coding sequence codonoptimized with rl mutation for enhanced potency regulated by the cags promoter  elevated levels of hfix in cultures of b lymphoblastoid cells required coelectroporation of the hfix transposon along with an sb transposase encoding plasmid demonstrating the role of transposition in achieving extended hfix expression there have been remarkable advances recently in the treatment of hemophilia b by systemic aavhfix administration but similar treatment of hemophilia a presents a significant challenge due to the size of the fviiiencoding sequence and the complexity of the protein we previously demonstrated bdomain deleted hfviii expression and correction of clotting dysfunction in fviii deficient mice by hydrodynamic delivery using the sb transposon system ohlfest et al blood    current studies are focused on identifying conditions for effective hfviii transposon delivery and long term expression in primary human b cells after sleeping beautymediated transposition results from these studies will be applicable to the development of a clinical protocol for treatment of human hemophilia by infusion of b cells genetically engineered using the sleeping beauty transposon system reference delivery

scott mcivor recessive dystrophic epidermyolysis bullosa rdeb epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily researchers classify dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa into three major types although the types differ in severity their features overlap significantly and they are caused by mutations in the same gene the autosomal recessive types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa rdeb result from mutations in both copies of the cola gene in each cell individuals with moderate and severe forms may have many complications and require psychological support along with attention to the care and protection of the skin and soft tissues when blisters appear the objectives of care are to reduce pain or discomfort prevent excessive loss of body fluid promote healing and prevent infection the doctor may prescribe a mild analgesic to prevent discomfort during changes of dressings bandages systemic delivery of collagen vii expressing isp™ cells for the rdeb patient population offers some major advantages over other forms of therapy  recent data suggests that intravenously administered c could simultaneously migrate to the dermalepidermal junction dej throughout the rdeb patient’s skin reverse the “subclinical” microscopic epidermaldermal separation and prophylactically prevent frank skin blisters and erosions from forming we believe that protein therapy via intravenous c may be a valid therapeutic strategy for patients with rdeb who currently have few therapeutic options i i woodley d t et al intravenously injected recombinant human type vii collagen homes to skin wounds and restores skin integrity of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa j invest dermatol  –  sarcopenia muscle loss with aging one of the most distinctive characteristics of older people is the presence of skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy the term sarcopenia was used for the first time by rosenberg to refer to the loss of lean body mass with aging the prevalence of sarcopenia in the older population may range from  to  depending on the gender of the participants and country immusoft has identified a suitable molecular candidate delivered by isp™ cells to reverse the effects of agerelated sarcopenia hiv there exists a growing interest in interventions that either fully eradicate all replicationcompetent hiv a “sterilizing” cure or efforts that result in sustained control of persistent virus often referred to as a “functional cure” our overall vision is to target the viral reservoir using genemodified autologous plasmablasts  which secrete a known broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from elite hiv suppressors these antibodies will  enable the clearance of rare reservoir cells that spontaneously reactivate during art leading to a gradual but eventually profound decrease in reservoir size and  prevent replication of any residual virus after art is discontinued immusoft has identified several broadly neutralizing antibodies to be delivered using an isp™ cell therapy as a cellbased treatment option to prevent or even eradicate an hiv infection atherosclerosis immusoft has identified a

coagulation factor viii and ix respectively resulting in the inability to form blood clots and sustained bleeding after trauma or injury recombinant clotting factor protein is currently used to treat hemophilia at a high cost per patient  as a therapeutic approach for hemophilia gene transfer has the potential to provide more consistent levels of circulating clotting factor over an extended period of time for more costeffective treatment  moreover only modest levels of fviii or fix expression  of normal can improve clinical outcomes we are using the sleeping beauty sb transposon system to engineer autologous human b cells for secretion of clotting factors as a cellular therapy for hemophilia  an in vitro system for expansion and differentiation of memory b cells into plasma cells has been developed  plasma cells are suitable for sustained delivery of fviii or fix since they secrete high levels of protein and may survive for years in vivo  for human fix expression we assembled an sb transposon with the human fix coding sequence codonoptimized with rl mutation for enhanced potency regulated by the cags promoter  elevated levels of hfix in cultures of b lymphoblastoid cells required coelectroporation of the hfix transposon along with an sb transposase encoding plasmid demonstrating the role of transposition in achieving extended hfix expression there have been remarkable advances recently in the treatment of hemophilia b by systemic aavhfix administration but similar treatment of hemophilia a presents a significant challenge due to the size of the fviiiencoding sequence and the complexity of the protein we previously demonstrated bdomain deleted hfviii expression and correction of clotting dysfunction in fviii deficient mice by hydrodynamic delivery using

cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily researchers classify dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa into three major types although the types differ in severity their features overlap significantly and they are caused by mutations in the same gene the autosomal recessive types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa rdeb result from mutations in both copies of the cola gene in each cell individuals with moderate and severe forms may have many complications and require psychological support along with attention to the care and protection of the skin and soft tissues when blisters

interest in interventions that either fully eradicate all replicationcompetent hiv a “sterilizing” cure or efforts that result in sustained control of persistent virus often referred to as a “functional cure” our overall vision is to target the viral reservoir using genemodified autologous plasmablasts  which secrete a known broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from elite hiv suppressors these antibodies will  enable the clearance of rare reservoir cells that spontaneously reactivate during art leading to a gradual but eventually profound decrease in reservoir size and  prevent replication of any residual virus after art is discontinued immusoft has identified several broadly neutralizing antibodies to be delivered using an isp™ cell therapy as a cellbased treatment

lymphopoiesis culture system pipeline news  publications news publications contact the immusoft story immusoft’s mission is to develop a breakthrough autologous cell therapy platform for treating a variety of human diseases through our proprietary immune system programming isp™ technology isp™ technology can effectively reprogram a patient’s own cells to become miniature drug factories in the body the technology was designed to address current challenges faced with the production and delivery of conventional protein therapeutic drugs biologics the isp™ platform enables safe insertion of genes encoding the correct human homolog of a missing or defective proteins into a patient’s immune cells using the sleeping beauty sb transposon system – a nonviral vector   for decades researchers have focused on gene therapy approaches to treat human diseases engineering viruses to insert or replace missing or defective genes with functional copies has been commonplace however engineered viruses require significant modification to efficiently infect target cell types may be difficult to produce in the quantities needed for therapeutic use most viruses’ have payload limitations and are subject to immune clearance if seen as immunogenic foreign to the body gene therapy involving viral transduction continues to be associated with real or perceived safety issues for therapeutic use in humans   immusoft’s isp™ platform technology is hybrid cellgene therapy approach which uses a clinically validated nonviral vector for safe reliable insertion of functional genes into immune cells once administered back into the patient a subset of isp™ modified cells reside within survival niches in the body continuously secreting geneencoded proteins the platform’s broad utility to produce virtually any biologic drug entity ie antibodies proteins or enzymes has the potential to disrupt the current standard of care for many diseases requiring recombinant enzyme replacement therapy as well as address orphan diseases with very small patient populations platform this provides immusoft with a highly efficient alternative to the current viral genedelivery vehicles in addition we have an exclusive license option to core bcell technology from the baltimore lab at caltech which provides a reliable methodology for the differentiationamplification of modified bcellderived plasma cell subsets expressing therapeutic proteins for introduction into the patient we have filed two additional patent applications covering our extensive modifications to the technology   our lead indication is mps mucopolysaccharidosis type i mps a lethal disease which results from the lack of a functional enzyme called αl iduronidase idua in its most severe form children die at the early age of  yrs otherwise known as hurler scheiesyndrome the disease requires frequent idua infusions which are expensive and palliative at best longterm survival is difficult to achieve a key  immusoft goal is the submission of an ind for the treatment of mps using reprogrammed patientderived plasma cells to express high levels of idua achievement of this milestone will pave the way to the first clinical trial involving use of the   platform in human trials will position immusoft to successfully build a pipeline of genebased therapies to treat a number of serious diseases that currently have no effective therapeutic options our long term strategy is to advance internal programs for select indications and to work with strategic partners to find genebased treatments for other serious diseases that
