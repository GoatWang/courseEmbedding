foot locker july    pm edt by theonlineinvestorcom bnk invest shutterstock photo in the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization russell  component macquarie infrastructure corp symbol mic was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the sp  for example foot locker inc symbol fl according to the online investor  market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on for various reasons the most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given companys stock many beginning investors look at one stock trading at  and another trading at  and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much  that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist but comparing market capitalization factoring in those share counts creates a true applestoapples comparison of the value of two stocks in the case of macquarie infrastructure corp symbol mic the market cap is now b versus foot locker inc symbol fl at b below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of mic vs fl another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers  much like the way a midsize sedan is typically compared to other midsize sedans and not suvs this can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock and which mutual funds and etfs are willing to own the stock for instance a mutual fund that is focused solely on large cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized  billion or larger another illustrative example is the sp midcap index which essentially takes the sp  index and tosses out the biggest  companies so as to focus solely on the  smaller upandcomers which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals and etfs that directly follow an index like the sp  will only own the underlying component of that index selling companies that lose their status as an sp  company and buying companies when they are added to the index so a companys market cap especially in relation to other companies carries great importance and for this reason we at theonlineinvestorcom find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily micfl makes up

canadian dividend growth investor long only value dividend growth investingmarketplacedgi across north americasummarymacquarie infrastructure has outperformed the sp  in the last  years and particularly in the last  however mic has underperformed the sp  since october mic is managed externally by a professional team and its performance is dependent on the  diversified businesses it owns

liability company to a corporation over the past year and year periods macquarie infrastructure has outperformed spdr sp  etf trust nysearcaspy source google finance however in the past year macquarie infrastructure has declined  while spy has only declined  specifically macquarie infrastructure has started to underperform since late october  whats going on more on this later but first lets explore macquarie infrastructure as a business the business macquarie infrastructure is a holding company that relies on the performances of the businesses it holds to pay expenses and dividends macquarie infrastructure holds four businesses internationalmatex tank terminals imtt is a regional distribution centre for refined products storing and handling bulk liquids at  marine terminals in the us and  in canada atlantic aviation provides fuel terminal and aircraft hangar services in  airports in the united states contracted power and energy cpe controls interests in gasfired wind and solar power facilities in the us hawaii gas processes and distributes gas in hawaii the ebitda diversification is shown below source q  results supplementary material pdf  slide  since macquarie infrastructure generates most of its ebitda from imtt and atlantic aviation macquarie infrastructures performance is dependent on the wellbeing of those businesses imtt continues to be a stable performer and atlantic aviation exceeded expectations last year lets take a look at these businesses in closer detail imtt macquarie infrastructure acquired  of imtt in  and acquired the rest in july  last year  of imtts revenue was generated from storing and handling refined petroleum products  was generated from storing and handling chemicals  was from storing and handling biofuels ie renewablevegetable and animal oil and  was from storing and handling crude oil and asphalt source imtt website imtts clients are mostly major oil companies major chemical companies or traders of these commodities about  of imtts  revenue was generated by its top  clients of which  were investment grade and the other  were not rated imtt doesnt do business with the exploration and production part of the oil industry that has the highest risk of creditworthy issues because imtts business performance is not macrofactor sensitive it should continue to give a stable performance with little sensitivity to the fluctuation of commodity prices this view is supported by imtts recent performance from  to  imtts gross profit increased at an average rate of  and its ebitda increased at an average rate of  last year its gross profit increased  to m and ebitda increased  to m which aligns with mics expectations atlantic aviation atlantic aviation operates fixed based operations fbos in  airports in the united states servicing predominantly owners and operators of general aviation aircraft for corporate and leisure purposes fbos tend to have a high barrier to entry because airports have limited space for additional fbos since  atlantic aviation has divested  sites acquired new fbos and only kept ones with better future prospects source atlantic aviation website in economic downturns there will likely be higher volatility in atlantic aviations business performance however mic estimates that for every  decrease in flight volumes free cash flow will only be reduced by  atlantic aviation reduces risk by having fbos in diverse locations across the us with different economic drivers such that when flight activity decreases in a region another region might see flight activity increase additionally atlantic aviation buys fuel at a wholesale price and then sells the fuel to customers atlantic aviation has little exposure to the commodity price of jet fuel because it usually carries a limited inventory of the fuel and passes fuel cost changes to customers from  to  atlantic aviations gross profit increased at an average rate of  and its ebitda increased at an average rate of  last year gross profit increased  to m and its ebitda increased  to m the higher profit was helped by acquisitions in the last  months cpe the contracted power businesss primary customers are creditworthy these customers have entered into power purchase agreements or tolling agreements for  to  years which help stabilize the cash flows from this business from  to  cpes gross profit increased at an average rate of  and its ebitda increased at an average rate of  last year gross profit increased  to m and its ebitda increased  to m these growth numbers are abnormally high because of divestiture and acquisition activities for example in august  cpe divested its  interest in a district energy business in chicago illinois as well bec a gasfired power facility in bayonne new jersey was acquired in april  the following fact also might skew the perceived performance of the cpe business the financial results … reflect  of the fullyear performance of the solar and wind power facilities within the cpe segment not the contribution based on our economic interest  form k  annual report so its best to observe cpes performance in the coming quarters instead of being caught up with s financial results at the end of  cpe had controlling interests in  solar power facilities  in arizona  in california  in texas and  in hawaii  wind power facilities in idaho and new mexico and had  interest bec the hawaii solar power facility is under development and is expected to be in service in the middle of this year the combined facilities had the generating capacity of mw of which  was generated from bec  was from wind facilities and  was from solar facilities hawaii gas hawaii gas has been in business for over a century and is hawaiis only governmentfranchised gas utility and gas distribution business it is also one of the largest propane distribution businesses in hawaii hawaii gas operates on hawaiis  major islands serving about  utility customers and  nonutility customers and the loss of any customer will not materially affect its business hawaii gass main products include synthetic natural gas liquefied petroleum gas liquefied natural gas and renewable natural gas mic acquired hawaiian gas in  and has invested m in the business such as developing gas storage capacity source hawaii gas website from  to  hawaii gass gross profit increased at an average rate of  and its ebitda increased at an average rate of  last year gross profit increased  to m and its ebitda increased  to m distribution and its growth at under  macquarie infrastructure yields  it has increased its dividend for  consecutive years and  consecutive quarters its year distribution growth rate is  while that might jump out to some investors its last quarterly dividend was only  higher than a year before shareholders may be concerned about the high fees paid to mics external manager in the sense that more paid to the manager implies less paid to shareholders in distributions however a portion of the managers payment is based on the performance of the stock so it could be viewed as a winwin situation for the manager and other shareholders with mics pipeline of growth projects and assuming its businesses continue to deliver stable performances mic targets to pay out distribution per share dps of  this year taking the midpoint of that it would be a growth of  from s dps of  macquarie infrastructures distribution could consist of dividends or return of capital and it intends to pay out  of its free cash flow as distributions its  payout ratio was  interested investors should check out mics website for the tax information on its distribution the manager and its implications macquarie infrastructure is managed externally by macquarie infrastructure management usa inc a member of macquarie group based in sydney australia a global leader in managing infrastructure investment vehicles on behalf of thirdparty investors macquarie infrastructures manager gets a monthly base management fee based primarily on macquarie infrastructures market cap and potentially a quarterly performance fee based on the stock performance relative to a us utility index specifically the performance fee is  of the difference between the benchmark return and the return for mics shareholders the default method of settling both base management and performance fees is through the reinvestment of the fees in shares when reinvestment occurs more shares may be issued which translates to shareholder dilution as usual when more shares are issued it only benefits shareholders if the capital put back into the business generates good returns from  to  the base management fee was  higher increasing from m to m and the performance fees were  higher increasing from m to m as of february   the external manager held  of macquarie infrastructures outstanding shares if it chooses to sell any of those shares it may be viewed as a negative signal by the market in the event our manager chooses not to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares the amount paid will reduce the cash that may otherwise be distributed as a dividend to all shareholders or used in our companys operations in the event our manager chooses to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares effectively returning the cash to us such reinvestment and the issuance of new shares will dilute existing shareholders by the increase in the percentage of shares owned by our manager  form k  annual report the manager also placed two of its employees as the ceo and cfo of mic it can remove the ceo or cfo without any notice and the manager can even resign with  days notice if either of these events happened it would likely disrupt mics operations because mic would quickly need to look for suitable replacements my other concern as a potential investor is that the external management might make decisions with a focus on shortterm results instead of longterm sustainable results due to the performance fees only time will tell whether that holds true or not why has mic underperformed recently macquarie infrastructures underperformance compared to the spy since october  may have to do with the following factors source google finance in early october mic announced multiple investments including atlantic aviations fbo investment in salt lake city and cpes m solar power projects in hawaii then in january  mic announced growth projects of m across its four businesses new investments are made to create future value but theres always risk involved regarding whether the projects will progress and work as expected so usually when an acquisition or investment is made the stock would fall mics  fall in share price in february was believed to be due to an erroneous online article that led investors to believe that mics q  dividend was reduced as soon as mic corrected the news its share price started recovering immediately additionally mics slowing distribution growth may be a concern to shareholders the table below displays mics quarterly distribution per share and its growth rate dps dgr q    q    q    q    q    however i think dps growth should be viewed at least on a year over year basis and not on a quarterly basis because quarterly results can be affected by seasonality and other shortterm factors conclusion with a pipeline of more than m in approved growth projects of which the majority is expected to complete in  it looks like macquarie infrastructure is poised for continued growth in fact mic targets distributions per share to be  higher than in  the shares are priced at a  discount based on its normal multiple and its aboveaverage  yield is also compelling before investing there are several concerns to think about concerns include the fact that mic relies on its external manager which is likely pricier than if the company were managed internally and the manager could pretty much resign and take the ceo and cfo with it if the manager so wishes theres also the possibility that the manager would favor shortterm growth instead of longterm sustainable growth due to performancebased fees based on shortterm performance at the same time the performance fees might motivate the manager to achieve more in a shorter time period only time will tell if this is a real concern or not source google finance another concern is that mic may be more sensitive to recessions than the market as shown in the year graph compared to the spy particularly investors should compare mics price and spys price in  however since then mic has made new investments and improved its business so it should be better prepared for the next recession share in the comments below which other company are you considering for a  yield are
