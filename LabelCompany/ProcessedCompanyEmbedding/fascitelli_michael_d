copresident of crew new york and a managing partner at rhodes associates michael fascitelli doesn’t want to hire his three sons though the venerable new york real estate executive currently the ceo of imperial companies and previously the founder of mdf capital and the president and ceo of vornado realty trust could easily employ his influence to secure any one of his young adult sons a coveted position at his company he said he’d rather they finish college work hard and pursue their own interests it’s this sense of dedication and the value placed on hard work that has earned fascitelli his seat among the real estate elite at the commercial real estate women network of new york’s november  luncheon fascitelli participated in a discussion with crain’s new york business senior real estate reporter dan geiger talking about everything from family values and frank sinatra to fascitelli’s extracurricular activities as a port authority board member and part owner of the milwaukee bucks with more than  years and counting in the new york real estate industry fascitelli has seen the transformation of the city and its neighborhoods firsthand recalling the formerly rough state of neighborhoods like hell’s kitchen which is now home to pricey apartments retail and entertainment he said “there isn’t a bad neighborhood in new york” when it comes to questions of oversupply and density in the big apple he noted “i don’t think new york is in bad shape there’s just always excess in these kinds of markets” for those looking to avoid this excess fascitelli said he sees potential in areas like the south bronx and the new jersey waterfront areas that are less developed than their other outerborough counterparts but are still within a feasible commuting distance from manhattan as commuters seem to make up more of the fabric of new york’s workforce fascitelli in his role on the board of the port authority is looking forward to accommodate this growing trend he said that his motivation for joining the board was to give back to the city in a way that will “benefit generations to come” and to those looking for an update on a new and improved port authority bus terminal “if i knew the timing” he said “i wouldn’t tell you anyway” photo courtesy of cocommunications imperial companies mdf capital michael fascitelli vornado realty trust related posts jv to redevelop historic

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
