 lebenthal lisanti capital growth llc all rights reserved ah lisanti capital growth july      overview philosophy process people process our investment process is both dynamic and disciplined—one part science one part art intellectually agnostic it combines disciplined methodology and gut intuition to limit excessive risk and capture the great return potential small caps offer ours is a parallel nonlinear process that creates a virtuous circle of investment thought it combines our topdown perspective with bottomup analysis—so we dont trip over our feet while our heads are in the clouds it requires relevant experience and sound judgment database analysis invest in companies with the wind at their back it starts with a database of approximately  companies that we whittle down to those we believe will thrive regardless of economic trends we look for many signs do they have a profitable business model based on intellectual property or a unique strategy maybe theres new management a new product launch or a change in their markets competitive landscape other things we look for include low debt expected earnings growth of at least  a history of success and experienced management teams this initial screening process narrows our field to approximately  companies fundamental research get out and kick the tires we take a closer look at their earnings power competitive environment and product offerings if we see a compelling story well pay them a visit to make sure their fundamentals and values are a reality—not just on paper in fact nothing tells you more about a company than meeting their management team face to face and we take the time to do this theme orientation move the way the world is moving investing in small caps requires creatively examining the political social economic and technological movements that are shaping the world once weve identified these themes we isolate the companies most likely to succeed in their wake this helps us focus our thinking take advantage of trends and capitalize on strategic shifts in the global marketplace it also maximizes our upside potential sell discipline get when the gettings good rising stars can explode if our original thesis is no longer valid or price momentum deteriorates we sell we also sell when stocks do well of course some stocks continue to thrive after we sell but we believe that if you hang on for the last dollar you run the risk of selling at a loss no thanks home  privacy policycopyright c  lebenthal lisanti capital growth llc all rights reserved lebenthal lisanti capital growth july
