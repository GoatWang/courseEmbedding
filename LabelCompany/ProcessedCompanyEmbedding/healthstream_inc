results management believes that net income before interest income taxes sharebased compensation depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company because adjusted ebitda reflects net income adjusted for noncash and nonoperating items we believe that adjusted ebitda is also used by many investors to assess the companys results from current operations adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under gaap because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with gaap it is susceptible to varying calculations accordingly adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in recent years the company has acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue in accordance with gaap reporting requirements following the completion of any such acquisition the company may record a writedown of deferred revenue to fair value as defined in gaap if the company is required to record a writedown of deferred revenue it may result in lower recognized revenue operating income and net income in subsequent periods in connection therewith this release presents below nongaap operating income and nongaap net income which in each such case reflects the corresponding gaap figures adjusted to exclude the impact of the deferred revenue writedown associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses as referenced above management believes that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures assists investors in understanding the companys performance between periods excluding the impact of this deferred revenue writedown and provides a useful measure of the ongoing performance of the company both on a quarterly and yeartodate basis the revenue for the acquired business is deferred and typically recognized over a one to two year period following the completion of any particular acquisition so our gaap revenues for this one to two year period will not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value these nongaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance which are prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of our gaap to nongaap financial measures which are set forth below in this release  about healthstream healthstream nasdaq hstm is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through the development of healthcare
