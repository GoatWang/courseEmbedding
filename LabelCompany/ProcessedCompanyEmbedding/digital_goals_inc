issuesubscribefollow usadvertisementadvertisement  marketing tools apple exploits to build the hypethe iphone backorders tweet cascades and exploding stock prices aren’t unrelated–apple is doing something right besides making products people worship once you’ve got the goods here’s how to take a page from its marketing playbook by catherine kaputa minute readwhether it’s launching its latest iphone or ipad apple sure knows how to create buzz with consumers and the media recent maps debacle aside while other companies fight for attention apple seems to effortlessly dominate the media–not to mention the hearts and minds of customers–with its new product launches recently apple sold  million iphone ’s on day one and then a couple of days later the stock hit the stratospheric price of  a share so you could say they’re doing something rightadvertisementin researching hundreds of successful entrepreneurial companies for my new book i was struck by strategies and tactics used by apple to create media and consumer buzz that were not commonly employed by other brandsif you want to build buzz like apple does–and maybe someday get your stock to their level–take note of these five marketing tactics they cultivate an air of secrecy and intrigue to fuel speculation and buzz many companies go to great lengths to preserve confidentiality during the product development phase but apple is a master of the teaser marketing campaign dragging on the suspense for as long as possible for weeks if not months before the release of every iphone the media conversation builds to deafening levels apple stokes the buzz by providing virtually no information for example apple announced a press conference for september  0 but didn’t say what the press announcement was about in essence apple created a cliffhanger as the media and bloggers speculated”what could it be–the new iphone  or something else all the bottomup speculation in the media and blogosphere generated phenomenal consumer interest–for free only after weeks of free buzz did apple launch a paid media campaign to keep the momentum goingthe takeawaystart building relationships with the media and bloggers–the influencers who cover your industry nurture and expand them over time remember the internet is word of mouth on steroids marketers have always known that the best way to promote your product is to get others to do it for you nothing is more valuable than getting thirdparty experts to tout your brand take another page from apple’s marketing book and launch a teaser campaign a series of short cryptic announcements that lead up to a larger fullblown marketing campaign and watch the interest and momentum buildthey create the illusion of scarcity to increase demandluxury goods marketers have long realized that scarcity real or perceived makes a product more desirable and in demand scarcity not only increases the value of a product it propels the procrastinators and all us who want to be part of the trendy crowd to step up and buy that’s why it is a favored tactic of designer handbag manufacturers and other luxury goods apple has found its own ways to hype the sense of faux scarcity it did not have enough phones available when it went on sale just one hour after the iphone  went on sale for preorders on september  0 the apple website reported that heavy demand had necessitated delayed delivery adding to the illusion of scarcity was the fact that you could only preorder the phone and lines were long the tactic worked not only did the iphone  set a record for firstday sales even two weeks after the iphone went on sale it was on a back order of three to four weeks prolonging the difficulty and desirability of owning oneadvertisementthe takeawayconsider intentionally restricting production of a product to create scarcity and fuel demand for your product other tactics you can explore are making the offer only available for a limited time or until a certain number have been sold or you can report on your website or customer sales calls that only a small number of certain items are left in stock–but only if that’s really the casethey focus on a “friendly” customer experienceapple products have always been designed to be different delightful and friendly i say “friendly” because the core driver of every apple product is the removal of complexity in favor of ease of use with innovative features like touchscreen “gestures” for zooming and scrolling or siri your personal assistant its history of innovative “friendly” gadgets creates anticipation about what they will do next to advance the consumer experience the new iphone  ads capture its new friendly features in one phrase “inch retina display ultrafast wireless ios  in a thinner lighter design”the takeawaythink outsidein as smart branders do begin with your customer first outside then figure out how your can improve your product or service to meet that customer need inside ask yourself “what would make your product easier to use for customers” and “how can you make the customer experience special and different–at every touch point” think of the customer experience holistically don’t stop with the product design but look at the way it’s sold and displayed in the store or on your website as well as the customer service experience with your call center make sure that the customer benefits your product offers are crisp and clear in all your marketing–like the iphone tagline abovethey wow customers through design and packagingnot only does apple have a history of product innovations they package their products brilliantly steve jobs famously looked outside the tech world for design and packaging inspiration at japanese packaging design italian car finishes and the like he was one of the first technology leaders to realize that beautiful design can be an important product differentiator apple’s brand architecture is monolithic every touch point conveys a modern minimalistic brand image from the product design itself to its packaging to the apple store where you can buy it go into an apple store and you’ll find the same design aesthetic and brand personality as you’ll find in the gadget in your hand many customers are so wowed by apple’s beautiful”open me first” packaging that they don’t throw it away which is called “unboxing”advertisementthe takeawaymake sure every touch point where customers come into contact with your company and its products conveys your company’s brand personality with a unified visual identity a distinct look and feel that sets you apart from others find a visual hook a visual something a design a color a logo or a shape that your brand can own in the minds of customers aim to have a visual identity that is instantly recognizable like apple’sthey create a passionate brand community of fans who identity with apple’s brand valueswhile other tech manufacturers see their products as utilitarian geeky and inexpensive apple is the opposite cool friendly and upmarket apple has created a brand culture that has attracted a passionate brand community of followers who identify with the brand’s innovativeness simplicity and coolness they are fans who lock into the entire family of apple products and must have the latest gadget right when it comes out even if it means waiting in line for hours it’s quite a phenomenon to beholdthe takeawaywrite down your brand values that define your brand culture remember apple’s “think different” ad campaign that defined apple’s brand values and brand culture here were the opening lines “here’s to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in square holes…” once you have defined what your brand stands for then zero in on the types of consumers who share those values and create digital communities through social media blogs or inperson meetups so that it’s easy for your brand’s fans to connect to your company and each otherif you want to get your products noticed maybe it’s time for you to start breaking the rules as apple doesadvertisementcatherine kaputa is a brand consultant and author of breakthrough

highlevel goals to keep your marketing on track the range of marketing channels available today and the rate at which they change drives to us to work longer harder and more efficiently  it can often feel like you are ice skating uphill the challenge can seem even harder if realistic goals arent set to base your plans around  the lack of goals and just a constant neverending journey of change can mean that we miss out on the rewards of achievement my time spent as part of growing a marketing agency with smaller and larger multi billion dollar companies has taught me that both benefit businesses and staff benefit from moving to clearer goals goals are different to objectives and kpis even in my relatively short time in marketing  years i have seen the rise of data analytics information and i for one value its power within organisations that being said all this analysis tools insights are also one of the root causes to ineffective marketing and a lack of creativity i believe digital marketing teams have become too data orientated they lack vision creativity and confidence goals are a way to solve this while keeping elements of measurement goals are not commercial metrics or objectives neither should they be about marketing performance indicators so goals are a higherlevel tool to help understand if you are on track or not and are important for different reasons to specific objectives without goals you dont have context for performance in our delivering results from digital marketing guide we give examples of broader vision and goals against more

of distractions choices and channels imagine the power of that in your business people can say no without the fear lets face it in  it is easy to be busy doing lots of stuff and work hard doing it but without goals and focus its impact can be negligible no matter your position in a company equally they can all be measured with  simple metrics success and goals the definition of success if you are working towards a predetermined goal and know where you are going you are a success earl nightgale wrote this in the the strangest secret in the s where he argues that with goals you will be

time resource budget skills knowledge process step three understand the benefits and list performance indicators be clear on both the business benefits as well as the benefits to those in the business

seek there are no right or wrong rules when it comes to getting the work done use whatever methods and tools you are most comfortable with step five reward or walk away if you hit your goals what is your reward what is the teams reward what is your customers reward your partners  agencies rewards equally what is your walk away point at what point do you think this goal is not right its too high it didnt anticipate x and y happening when do you know to start the process again this is a common concept in negotiations you should never enter negotiations with understanding your parameters for walking away the same goes for goals not every goal is achievable and that is no bad thing as long you learn are you aimlessly chasing a mass of activities without the structure of goals why not try
