associations nba seattle supersonics phoenix suns and boston celtics and coach of the los angeles clippers he was an alumnus of dominguez high school los angeles harbor college and pepperdine university a prototypical late bloomer johnson overcame early struggles and had a successful nba playing career drafted th overall in  by the seattle supersonics johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard he eventually led the sonics to their only nba championship in  winning the finals mvp award after a short stint with the phoenix suns he became the starting point guard for the boston celtics with whom he won two more championships johnson was voted into five allstar teams one allnba first and one second team and nine consecutive alldefensive first and second teams apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in nba playoffs history the celtics franchise has retired johnsons  jersey which hangs from the rafters of the td garden the home arena of the team on april   the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame officially announced that johnson had been posthumously elected to the hall he was formally inducted on august  he is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time contents  early years  professional career  seattle supersonics –  phoenix suns –  boston celtics –  postplayer career  head coaching record  legacy  personal life  death  see also  references  external links early yearsedit dennis wayne johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in compton california a suburb of los angeles originally a baseball fan and a little leaguer johnson learned basketball from his father but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers as a teenager at dominguez high school johnson measured just  and played only a minute or two each game after high school he worked several odd jobs including a perhour job as a forklift driver and played with his brothers in summer league games after work during this period johnson grew to a height of  and developed what some later described as rocket launcher legs which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents jim white the coach at los angeles harbor college had watched johnson play street basketball feeling that johnson excelled in defense white asked him to enroll johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard averaging  points and  rebounds per game and leading harbor to a college junior state title however the young guard lacked discipline often clashed with white and was thrown off the team three times in two years at the end of his junior college career two universities offered johnson scholarships azusa pacific university and pepperdine university johnson chose the latter and in his only year in college he averaged  points  rebounds and  assists per game and developed a reputation for tough defense after that year johnson made himself eligible for the  nba draft but was skeptical that any team would take him nba teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues and johnson was known to be a troublemaker professional careeredit seattle supersonics –edit the seattle supersonics took johnson in the second round of the  draft with the th pick and gave him a fouryear contract with which he earned a salary of  in the first year and  in the last in his rookie year the – nba season johnson playing backup to the experienced sonics backcourt tandem of slick watts and fred brown averaged  points and  assists per game the sonics finished with a – record and missed the  nba playoffs leading head coach bill russell to resign in the following season the team lost  of the first  games under russells replacement bob hopkins who was replaced by hall of fame coach lenny wilkens who gave johnson a starting spot and paired him with gus williams johnson revelled in this new role improving his averages to  points and  assists per game during this period johnson played shooting guard and was known for his aggressive slam dunking in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career it was at this time that johnsons nickname dj was coined by playbyplay announcer bob blackburn to help distinguish him from teammates john johnson and vinnie johnson whom blackburn referred to as jj and vj respectively finishing strongly the sonics ended the regular season with a – record and made the  nba playoffs after eliminating the los angeles lakers the defending champion portland trail blazers and the denver nuggets they almost defeated the washington bullets by taking a – lead in the  nba finals in a – game  victory johnson blocked seven shots—the most blocks in nba finals history for a guard the sonics lost in seven games however partly because of johnsons game  scoring drought in which the secondyear guard missed all of his  field goal attempts johnson later acknowledged that he simply choked he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player johnson and the sonics got their revenge in the – season after clinching the pacific division with a – record the team met the bullets again in the  nba finals after losing game  the sonics won the next four games to take the finals series helped by johnson who averaged almost  points along with six rebounds and assists per game he scored  points in a game  overtime victory and was named nba finals mvp it was during this season that johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league he averaged  points and  assists per game and made his first alldefensive first team and allstar game appearance during the following season johnson averaged  points and  assists appeared in his second allstar game and was named to the alldefensive first team and allnba second team the sonics however lost in the western conference finals to the lakers who had hall of famers jamaal wilkes magic johnson and kareem abduljabbar because of the abundance of talent on the sonics team johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career the sonics may well have won a nd straight championship in a third straight run to the finals but point guard gus williams held out that season he sought  million for a season a paltry sum by todays standards but the sonics refused to pay and it ultimately cost them their last shot at the finals for  more seasons coach wilkens grew tired of johnson who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability to the team at the end of the season johnson was traded to the phoenix suns for paul westphal and draft picks the sonics finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of westphal phoenix suns –edit johnson further established himself as a quality player in phoenix in his three years as a sun johnson averaged – points a game and provided tough defense he played in two allstar games was voted into three consecutive alldefensive first teams and earned his only allnba first team appearance in this period johnson like in seattle played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team as opposed to being the second or third option as a sonic in the first two years of johnsons stint the suns were fairly successful reaching the western conference semifinals both seasons the suns bowed out in the first round in johnsons last year johnsons situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at phoenix like in seattle he often clashed with his coach john macleod and finally was traded by general manager jerry colangelo to the boston celtics for rick robey and draft picks like seattle after johnsons departure the suns finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of robey boston celtics –edit between the – season and – season seasons the celtics had lost to the philadelphia ers in the eastern conference finals  out of  times mainly because physical sixers guard andrew toney routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt after subsequently getting swept by the bucks in the – eastern conference semifinals celtics general manager red auerbach added the perennial alldefensive team member johnson to his squad hoping that it would help the celtics fare better in the eastern conference playoffs particular against the ers johnson joined a squad led by hall of fame forward larry bird who played in the frontcourt with two fellow hall of famers center robert parish and forward kevin mchale a combination often called the best frontcourt of all time by the nba johnson described joining the celtics as a dream come true and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager auerbach who was living history according to johnson with the celtics johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career after being known as a slam dunking shooting guard with the sonics and an allaround scorer with the suns he now established himself as a point guard who was defined more by playmaking than scoring in his first year as a celtic he averaged  points and  assists and was elected to the alldefensive second team the celtics reached the  nba finals where they met the los angeles lakers their intense rivals since the s the celtics won – and johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on hall of fame lakers playmaker earvin johnson limiting him to a subaverage  points in the last four games and being at least partly responsible for several of the laker point guards gamedeciding errors in games   and  as a result magic johnson was taunted as tragic johnson whenever the lakers and celtics played against each other in the – season johnson continued playing smothering defense earning his next alldefensive second team callup while averaging  points and  assists per game the celtics met the lakers in the  nba finals again johnsons big moment came in game  when the score was tied at  teammate larry bird had the ball in the last seconds being doubleteamed by lakers kareem abduljabbar and magic johnson bird passed to the open johnson and the guard sank a ft buzzer beater to win the game the lakers however took their revenge this time winning the series in six games powered by venerable yearold finals mvp abduljabbar johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career because the celtics were close to winning the series but could not get the job done in the following season the celtics made the playoffs helped by the performance of johnson who made the alldefensive second team again while tallying  points and  assists per game after defeating the milwaukee bucks in the eastern conference finals the celtics reached the  nba finals against the upandcoming houston rockets led by the twin towers of centers ralph sampson and hakeem olajuwon led by finals mvp larry bird the celtics beat the rockets – and johnson won his third title the celtics were unable to repeat their title in  despite several dramatic playoff victories johnson played strong defense again earning yet another appearance on the alldefensive first team and the celtics embarked on a nailbiting playoff campaign in the  eastern conference semifinals the celtics split the first six games against the milwaukee bucks in the deciding game  which the celtics won johnson had a spectacular play with  left in the game a celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds but johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in midair against bucks center and former sonics teammate jack sikma the ball bounced off sikma before going out of bounds and the celtics maintained possession in the next round the  eastern conference finals the celtics faced the detroit pistons the series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals featuring a great level of personal animosity sharp rhetoric and several physical altercations the center of this feud was pistons pivot bill laimbeer who brawled with celtics players bird and parish in game  johnson was involved in a crucial play down  larry bird stole the inbounds pass by pistons point guard isiah thomas with  seconds left and passed it to a sprinting johnson who converted a difficult layup with  second left in the game this play caused celtics broadcaster johnny most to shout out one of his most famous calls “ now theres a steal by bird underneath to dj who lays it in right at one second left what a play by bird bird stole the inbounding pass laid it up to dj and dj laid it up and in and boston has a onepoint lead with one second left oh my this place is going crazy ” according to johnson this was his favorite play of alltime games  and  also featured a feud this time between pistons forward dennis rodman and johnson in game  which the pistons won rodman taunted johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head when the celtics took game  johnson went back at rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture in the  nba finals however the celtics succumbed to the los angeles lakers – as lakers playmaker and finals mvp magic johnson put up a great performance averaging  points and  assists throughout the series the next three seasons were disappointing for the aging celtics in the – season johnson averaged  points and  assists but in the  playoffs the celtics were unable to beat the detroit pistons in the eastern conference finals in the next season johnson who statistically declined to  points and  assists per game and his team made the  nba playoffs on a meager – record largely due to the absence of star forward larry bird for almost the entire season but were immediately eliminated in the first round again largely due to the absence of the injured larry bird the following – nba season was johnsons last the now yearold playmaker relinquished his starting point guard role to younger john bagley but when bagley dislocated his shoulder johnson returned with a high level of performance and was lovingly called our glue man by coach jimmy rodgers in that season johnson started in  of his  games averaging  points and  assists but the celtics failed to survive the first round of the  nba playoffs johnson retired after the celtics did not offer him a new contract at the beginning of the  season during his retirement ceremony his perennial los angeles lakers opponent magic johnson telegraphed him and lauded him as the best backcourt defender of alltime in addition celtics colleague and triple nba most valuable player award winner larry bird called johnson the best teammate he ever had postplayer careeredit after retiring as a player johnson worked as a scout for the celtics in  he became an assistant coach for the celtics a position he held until  after spending several years outside the limelight he returned as an assistant coach for the los angeles clippers in  and spent four seasons there for  games toward the end of the – season johnson served as interim head coach after the departure of alvin gentry johnson later worked as a scout for the portland trail blazers and in  he was named head coach of the nba development leagues florida flame he became head

averages of  points  rebounds and  assists per game known as a defensive stalwart he was elected into nine straight alldefensive first or second teams nba legend george gervin said in a podcast with journalist bill simmons that johnson was the hardest defender he ever played against johnson is also acknowledged by the nba as a money player who was clutch in decisive moments such as scoring  points for his team in a game  overtime victory in the  nba finals playing smothering defense on magic johnson in the  nba finals and converting a lastsecond layup in game  of the  eastern conference finals after a larry bird steal furthermore johnson is lauded by the nba as a versatile allaround weapon who played with contagious competitiveness and was known for his durability in  nba seasons he

and  assists on december   the celtics franchise retired his number  jersey johnson said he would always be a boston celtic and remarked that seeing his number in the rafters gave him a special feeling however johnson did not live to see an induction into the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame a fact that has been a considerable point of debate with sports journalists bill simmons of espn called his hall of fame snub an ongoing injustice stating that according to him joe dumars – a hall of famer known for strong defense rather than spectacular scoring like johnson – was no better a basketball player than him colleague ken shouler called johnson one of the first guys id give a hall of fame pass contemporary boston celtics hall of fame forward larry bird gave johnson ultimate praise calling him the best teammate he ever had in his autobiography drive which is especially significant considering birds teammates included hall of famers kevin mchale robert parish bill walton

hall of fame as player dennis wayne johnson september   – february   nicknamed dj was an american professional basketball player for the national basketball associations nba seattle supersonics phoenix suns and boston celtics and coach of the los angeles clippers he was an alumnus of dominguez high school los angeles harbor college and pepperdine university a prototypical late bloomer johnson overcame early struggles and had a successful nba playing career drafted th overall in  by the seattle supersonics johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard he eventually led the sonics to their only nba championship in  winning the finals mvp award after a short stint with the phoenix suns he became the starting point guard for the boston celtics with whom he won two more championships johnson was voted into five allstar teams one allnba first and one second team and nine consecutive alldefensive first and second teams apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in nba playoffs history the celtics franchise has retired johnsons  jersey which hangs from the rafters of the td garden the home arena of the team on april   the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame officially announced that johnson had been posthumously elected to the hall he was formally inducted on august  he is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time contents  early years  professional career  seattle supersonics –  phoenix suns –  boston celtics –  postplayer career  head coaching record  legacy  personal life  death  see also  references  external links early yearsedit dennis wayne johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in compton california a suburb of los angeles originally a baseball fan and a little leaguer johnson learned basketball from his father but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers as a teenager at dominguez high school johnson measured just  and played only a minute or two each game after high school he worked several odd jobs including a perhour job as a forklift driver and played with his brothers in summer league games after work during this period johnson grew to a height of  and developed what some later described as rocket launcher legs which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents jim white the coach at los angeles harbor college had watched johnson play street basketball feeling that johnson excelled in defense white asked him to enroll johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard averaging  points and  rebounds per game and leading harbor to a college junior state title however the young guard lacked discipline often clashed with white and was thrown off the team three times in two years at the end of his junior college career two universities offered johnson scholarships azusa pacific university and pepperdine university johnson chose the latter and in his only year in college he averaged  points  rebounds and  assists per game and developed a reputation for tough defense after that year johnson made himself eligible for the  nba draft but was skeptical that any team would take him nba teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues and johnson was known to be a troublemaker professional careeredit seattle supersonics –edit the seattle supersonics took johnson in the second round of the  draft with the th pick and gave him a fouryear contract with which he earned a salary of  in the first year and  in the last in his rookie year the – nba season johnson playing backup to the experienced sonics backcourt tandem of slick watts and fred brown averaged  points and  assists per game the sonics finished with a – record and missed the  nba playoffs leading head coach bill russell to resign in the following season the team lost  of the first  games under russells replacement bob hopkins who was replaced by hall of fame coach lenny wilkens who gave johnson a starting spot and paired him with gus williams johnson revelled in this new role improving his averages to  points and  assists per game during this period johnson played shooting guard and was known for his aggressive slam dunking in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career it was at this time that johnsons nickname dj was coined by playbyplay announcer bob blackburn to help distinguish him from teammates john johnson and vinnie johnson whom blackburn referred to as jj and vj respectively finishing strongly the sonics ended the regular season with a – record and made the  nba playoffs after eliminating the los angeles lakers the defending champion portland trail blazers and the denver nuggets they almost defeated the washington bullets by taking a – lead in the  nba finals in a – game  victory johnson blocked seven shots—the most blocks in nba finals history for a guard the sonics lost in seven games however partly because of johnsons game  scoring drought in which the secondyear guard missed all of his  field goal attempts johnson later acknowledged that he simply choked he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player johnson and the sonics got their revenge in the – season after clinching the pacific division with a – record the team met the bullets again in the  nba finals after losing game  the sonics won the next four games to take the finals series helped by johnson who averaged almost  points along with six rebounds and assists per game he scored  points in a game  overtime victory and was named nba finals mvp it was during this season that johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league he averaged  points and  assists per game and made his first alldefensive first team and allstar game appearance during the following season johnson averaged  points and  assists appeared in his second allstar game and was named to the alldefensive first team and allnba second team the sonics however lost in the western conference finals to the lakers who had hall of famers jamaal wilkes magic johnson and kareem abduljabbar because of the abundance of talent on the sonics team johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career the sonics may well have won a nd straight championship in a third straight run to the finals but point guard gus williams held out that season he sought  million for a season a paltry sum by todays standards but the sonics refused to pay and it ultimately cost them their last shot at the finals for  more seasons coach wilkens grew tired of johnson who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability to the team at the end of the season johnson was traded to the phoenix suns for paul westphal and draft picks the sonics finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of westphal phoenix suns –edit johnson further established himself as a quality player in phoenix in his three years as a sun johnson averaged – points a game and provided tough defense he played in two allstar games was voted into three consecutive alldefensive first teams and earned his only allnba first team appearance in this period johnson like in seattle played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team as opposed to being the second or third option as a sonic in the first two years of johnsons stint the suns were fairly successful reaching the western conference semifinals both seasons the suns bowed out in the first round in johnsons last year johnsons situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at phoenix like in seattle he often clashed with his coach john macleod and finally was traded by general manager jerry colangelo to the boston celtics for rick robey and draft picks like seattle after johnsons departure the suns finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of robey boston celtics –edit between the – season and – season seasons the celtics had lost to the philadelphia ers in the eastern conference finals  out of  times mainly because physical sixers guard andrew toney routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt after subsequently getting swept by the bucks in the – eastern conference semifinals celtics general manager red auerbach added the perennial alldefensive team member johnson to his squad hoping that it would help the celtics fare better in the eastern conference playoffs particular against the ers johnson joined a squad led by hall of fame forward larry bird who played in the frontcourt with two fellow hall of famers center robert parish and forward kevin mchale a combination often called the best frontcourt of all time by the nba johnson described joining the celtics as a dream come true and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager auerbach who was living history according to johnson with the celtics johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career after being known as a slam dunking shooting guard with the sonics and an allaround scorer with the suns he now established himself as a point guard who was defined more by playmaking than scoring in his first year as a celtic he averaged  points and  assists and was elected to the alldefensive second team the celtics reached the  nba finals where they met the los angeles lakers their intense rivals since the s the celtics won – and johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on hall of fame lakers playmaker earvin johnson limiting him to a subaverage  points in the last four games and being at least partly responsible for several of the laker point guards gamedeciding errors in games   and  as a result magic johnson was taunted as tragic johnson whenever the lakers and celtics played against each other in the – season johnson continued playing smothering defense earning his next alldefensive second team callup while averaging  points and  assists per game the celtics met the lakers in the  nba finals again johnsons big moment came in game  when the score was tied at  teammate larry bird had the ball in the last seconds being doubleteamed by lakers kareem abduljabbar and magic johnson bird passed to the open johnson and the guard sank a ft buzzer beater to win the game the lakers however took their revenge this time winning the series in six games powered by venerable yearold finals mvp abduljabbar johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career because the celtics were close to winning the series but could not get the job done in the following season the celtics made the playoffs helped by the performance of johnson who made the alldefensive second team again while tallying  points and  assists per game after defeating the milwaukee bucks in the eastern conference finals the celtics reached the  nba finals against the upandcoming houston rockets led by the twin towers of centers ralph sampson and hakeem olajuwon led by finals mvp larry bird the celtics beat the rockets – and johnson won his third title the celtics were unable to repeat their title in  despite several dramatic playoff victories johnson played strong defense again earning yet another appearance on the alldefensive first team and the celtics embarked on a nailbiting playoff campaign in the  eastern conference semifinals the celtics split the first six games against the milwaukee bucks in the deciding game  which the celtics won johnson had a spectacular play with  left in the game a celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds but johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in midair against bucks center and former sonics teammate jack sikma the ball bounced off sikma before going out of bounds and the celtics maintained possession in the next round the  eastern conference finals the celtics faced the detroit pistons the series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals featuring a great level of personal animosity sharp rhetoric and several physical altercations the center of this feud was pistons pivot bill laimbeer who brawled with celtics players bird and parish in game  johnson was involved in a crucial play down  larry bird stole the inbounds pass by pistons point guard isiah thomas with  seconds left and passed it to a sprinting johnson who converted a difficult layup with  second left in the game this play caused celtics broadcaster johnny most to shout out one of his most famous calls “ now theres a steal by bird underneath to dj who lays it in right at one second left what a play by bird bird stole the inbounding pass laid it up to dj and dj laid it up and in and boston has a onepoint lead with one second left oh my this place is going crazy ” according to johnson this was his favorite play of alltime games  and  also featured a feud this time between pistons forward dennis rodman and johnson in game  which the pistons won rodman taunted johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head when the celtics took game  johnson went back at rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture in the  nba finals however the celtics succumbed to the los angeles lakers – as lakers playmaker and finals mvp magic johnson put up a great performance averaging  points and  assists throughout the series the next three seasons were disappointing for the aging celtics in the – season johnson averaged  points and  assists but in the  playoffs the celtics were unable to beat the detroit pistons in the eastern conference finals in the next season johnson who statistically declined to  points and  assists per game and his team made the  nba playoffs on a meager – record largely due to the absence of star forward larry bird for almost the entire season but were immediately eliminated in the first round again largely due to the absence of the injured larry bird the following – nba season was johnsons last the now yearold playmaker relinquished his starting point guard role to younger john bagley but when bagley dislocated his shoulder johnson returned with a high level of performance and was lovingly called our glue man by coach jimmy rodgers in that season johnson started in  of his  games averaging  points and  assists but the celtics failed to survive the first round of the  nba playoffs johnson retired after the celtics did not offer him a new contract at the beginning of the  season during his retirement ceremony his perennial los angeles lakers opponent magic johnson telegraphed him and lauded him as the best backcourt defender of alltime in addition celtics colleague and triple nba most valuable player award winner larry bird called johnson the best teammate he ever had postplayer careeredit after retiring as a player johnson worked as a scout for the celtics in  he became an assistant coach for the celtics a position he held until  after spending several years outside the limelight he returned as an assistant coach for the los angeles clippers in  and spent four seasons there for  games toward the end of the – season johnson served as interim head coach after the departure of alvin

hall of fame as player dennis wayne johnson september   – february   nicknamed dj was an american professional basketball player for the national basketball associations nba seattle supersonics phoenix suns and boston celtics and coach of the los angeles clippers he was an alumnus of dominguez high school los angeles harbor college and pepperdine university a prototypical late bloomer johnson overcame early struggles and had a successful nba playing career drafted th overall in  by the seattle supersonics johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard he eventually led the sonics to their only nba championship in  winning the finals mvp award after a short stint with the phoenix suns he became the starting point guard for the boston celtics with whom he won two more championships johnson was voted into five allstar teams one allnba first and one second team and nine consecutive alldefensive first and second teams apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in nba playoffs history the celtics franchise has retired johnsons  jersey which hangs from the rafters of the td garden the home arena of the team on april   the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame officially announced that johnson had been posthumously elected to the hall he was formally inducted on august  he is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time contents  early years  professional career  seattle supersonics –  phoenix suns –  boston celtics –  postplayer career  head coaching record  legacy  personal life  death  see also  references  external links early yearsedit dennis wayne johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in compton california a suburb of los angeles originally a baseball fan and a little leaguer johnson learned basketball from his father but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers as a teenager at dominguez high school johnson measured just  and played only a minute or two each game after high school he worked several odd jobs including a perhour job as a forklift driver and played with his brothers in summer league games after work during this period johnson grew to a height of  and developed what some later described as rocket launcher legs which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents jim white the coach at los angeles harbor college had watched johnson play street basketball feeling that johnson excelled in defense white asked him to enroll johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard averaging  points and  rebounds per game and leading harbor to a college junior state title however the young guard lacked discipline often clashed with white and was thrown off the team three times in two years at the end of his junior college career two universities offered johnson scholarships azusa pacific university and pepperdine university johnson chose the latter and in his only year in college he averaged  points  rebounds and  assists per game and developed a reputation for tough defense after that year johnson made himself eligible for the  nba draft but was skeptical that any team would take him nba teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues and johnson was known to be a troublemaker professional careeredit seattle supersonics –edit the seattle supersonics took johnson in the second round of the  draft with the th pick and gave him a fouryear contract with which he earned a salary of  in the first year and  in the last in his rookie year the – nba season johnson playing backup to the experienced sonics backcourt tandem of slick watts and fred brown averaged  points and  assists per game the sonics finished with a – record and missed the  nba playoffs leading head coach bill russell to resign in the following season the team lost  of the first  games under russells replacement bob hopkins who was replaced by hall of fame coach lenny wilkens who gave johnson a starting spot and paired him with gus williams johnson revelled in this new role improving his averages to  points and  assists per game during this period johnson played shooting guard and was known for his aggressive slam dunking in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career it was at this time that johnsons nickname dj was coined by playbyplay announcer bob blackburn to help distinguish him from teammates john johnson and vinnie johnson whom blackburn referred to as jj and vj respectively finishing strongly the sonics ended the regular season with a – record and made the  nba playoffs after eliminating the los angeles lakers the defending champion portland trail blazers and the denver nuggets they almost defeated the washington bullets by taking a – lead in the  nba finals in a – game  victory johnson blocked seven shots—the most blocks in nba finals history for a guard the sonics lost in seven games however partly because of johnsons game  scoring drought in which the secondyear guard missed all of his  field goal attempts johnson later acknowledged that he simply choked he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player johnson and the sonics got their revenge in the – season after clinching the pacific division with a – record the team met the bullets again in the  nba finals after losing game  the sonics won the next four games to take the finals series helped by johnson who averaged almost  points along with six rebounds and assists per game he scored  points in a game  overtime victory and was named nba finals mvp it was during this season that johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league he averaged  points and  assists per game and made his first alldefensive first team and allstar game appearance during the following season johnson averaged  points and  assists appeared in his second allstar game and was named to the alldefensive first team and allnba second team the sonics however lost in the western conference finals to the lakers who had hall of famers jamaal wilkes magic johnson and kareem abduljabbar because of the abundance of talent on the sonics team johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career the sonics may well have won a nd straight championship in a third straight run to the finals but point guard gus williams held out that season he sought  million for a season a paltry sum by todays standards but the sonics refused to pay and it ultimately cost them their last shot at the finals for  more seasons coach wilkens grew tired of johnson who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability to the team at the end of the season johnson was traded to the phoenix suns for paul westphal and draft picks the sonics finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of westphal phoenix suns –edit johnson further established himself as a quality player in phoenix in his three years as a sun johnson averaged – points a game and provided tough defense he played in two allstar games was voted into three consecutive alldefensive first teams and earned his only allnba first team appearance in this period johnson like in seattle played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team as opposed to being the second or third option as a sonic in the first two years of johnsons stint the suns were fairly successful reaching the western conference semifinals both seasons the suns bowed out in the first round in johnsons last year johnsons situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at phoenix like in seattle he often clashed with his coach john macleod and finally was traded by general manager jerry colangelo to the boston celtics for rick robey and draft picks like seattle after johnsons departure the suns finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of robey boston celtics –edit between the – season and – season seasons the celtics had lost to the philadelphia ers in the eastern conference finals  out of  times mainly because physical sixers guard andrew toney routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt after subsequently getting swept by the bucks in the – eastern conference semifinals celtics general manager red auerbach added the perennial alldefensive team member johnson to his squad hoping that it would help the celtics fare better in the eastern conference playoffs particular against the ers johnson joined a squad led by hall of fame forward larry bird who played in the frontcourt with two fellow hall of famers center robert parish and forward kevin mchale a combination often called the best frontcourt of all time by the nba johnson described joining the celtics as a dream come true and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager auerbach who was living history according to johnson with the celtics johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career after being known as a slam dunking shooting guard with the sonics and an allaround scorer with the suns he now established himself as a point guard who was defined more by playmaking than scoring in his first year as a celtic he averaged  points and  assists and was elected to the alldefensive second team the celtics reached the  nba finals where they met the los angeles lakers their intense rivals since the s the celtics won – and johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on hall of fame lakers playmaker earvin johnson limiting him to a subaverage  points in the last four games and being at least partly responsible for several of the laker point guards gamedeciding errors in games   and  as a result magic johnson was taunted as tragic johnson whenever the lakers and celtics played against each other in the – season johnson continued playing smothering defense earning his next alldefensive second team callup while averaging  points and  assists per game the celtics met the lakers in the  nba finals again johnsons big moment came in game  when the score was tied at  teammate larry bird had the ball in the last seconds being doubleteamed by lakers kareem abduljabbar and magic johnson bird passed to the open johnson and the guard sank a ft buzzer beater to win the game the lakers however took their revenge this time winning the series in six games powered by venerable yearold finals mvp abduljabbar johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career because the celtics were close to winning the series but could not get the job done in the following season the celtics made the playoffs helped by the performance of johnson who made the alldefensive second team again while tallying  points and  assists per game after defeating the milwaukee bucks in the eastern conference finals the celtics reached the  nba finals against the upandcoming houston rockets led by the twin towers of centers ralph sampson and hakeem olajuwon led by finals mvp larry bird the celtics beat the rockets – and johnson won his third title the celtics were unable to repeat their title in  despite several dramatic playoff victories johnson played strong defense again earning yet another appearance on the alldefensive first team and the celtics embarked on a nailbiting playoff campaign in the  eastern conference semifinals the celtics split the first six games against the milwaukee bucks in the deciding game  which the celtics won johnson had a spectacular play with  left in the game a celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds but johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in midair against bucks center and former sonics teammate jack sikma the ball bounced off sikma before going out of bounds and the celtics maintained possession in the next round the  eastern conference finals the celtics faced the detroit pistons the series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals featuring a great level of personal animosity sharp rhetoric and several physical altercations the center of this feud was pistons pivot bill laimbeer who brawled with celtics players bird and parish in game  johnson was involved in a crucial play down  larry bird stole the inbounds pass by pistons point guard isiah thomas with  seconds left and passed it to a sprinting johnson who converted a difficult layup with  second left in the game this play caused celtics broadcaster johnny most to shout out one of his most famous calls “ now theres a steal by bird underneath to dj who lays it in right at one second left what a play by bird bird stole the inbounding pass laid it up to dj and dj laid it up and in and boston has a onepoint lead with one second left oh my this place is going crazy ” according to johnson this was his favorite play of alltime games  and  also featured a feud this time between pistons forward dennis rodman and johnson in game  which the pistons won rodman taunted johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head when the celtics took game  johnson went back at rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture in the  nba finals however the celtics succumbed to the los angeles lakers – as lakers playmaker and finals mvp magic johnson put up a great performance averaging  points and  assists throughout the series the next three seasons were disappointing for the aging celtics in the – season johnson averaged  points and  assists but in the  playoffs the celtics were unable to beat the detroit pistons in the eastern conference finals in the next season johnson who statistically declined to  points and  assists per game and his team made the  nba playoffs on a meager – record largely due to the absence of star forward larry bird for almost the entire season but were immediately eliminated in the first round again largely due to the absence of the injured larry bird the following – nba season was johnsons last the now yearold playmaker relinquished his starting point guard role to younger john bagley but when bagley dislocated his shoulder johnson returned with a high level of performance and was lovingly called our glue man by coach jimmy rodgers in that season johnson started in  of his  games averaging  points and  assists but the celtics failed to survive the first round of the  nba playoffs johnson retired after the celtics did not offer him a new contract at the beginning of the  season during his retirement ceremony his perennial los angeles lakers opponent magic johnson telegraphed him and lauded him as the best backcourt defender of alltime in addition celtics colleague and triple nba most valuable player award winner larry bird called johnson the best teammate he ever had postplayer careeredit after retiring as a player johnson worked as a scout for the celtics in  he became an assistant coach for the celtics a position he held until  after spending several years outside the limelight he returned as an assistant coach for the los angeles clippers in  and spent four seasons there for  games toward the end of the – season johnson served as interim head coach after the departure of alvin gentry johnson later worked as a scout for the portland trail blazers and in  he was named head coach of the nba development leagues florida flame he became head coach of the nbadls austin toros a

hall of fame as player dennis wayne johnson september   – february   nicknamed dj was an american professional basketball player for the national basketball associations nba seattle supersonics phoenix suns and boston celtics and coach of the los angeles clippers he was an alumnus of dominguez high school los angeles harbor college and pepperdine university a prototypical late bloomer johnson overcame early struggles and had a successful nba playing career drafted th overall in  by the seattle supersonics johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard he eventually led the sonics to their only nba championship in  winning the finals mvp award after a short stint with the phoenix suns he became the starting point guard for the boston celtics with whom he won two more championships johnson was voted into five allstar teams one allnba first and one second team and nine consecutive alldefensive first and second teams apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in nba playoffs history the celtics franchise has retired johnsons  jersey which hangs from the rafters of the td garden the home arena of the team on april   the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame officially announced that johnson had been posthumously elected to the hall he was formally inducted on august  he is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time contents  early years  professional career  seattle supersonics –  phoenix suns –  boston celtics –  postplayer career  head coaching record  legacy  personal life  death  see also  references  external links early yearsedit dennis wayne johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in compton california a suburb of los angeles originally a baseball fan and a little leaguer johnson learned basketball from his father but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers as a teenager at dominguez high school johnson measured just  and played only a minute or two each game after high school he worked several odd jobs including a perhour job as a forklift driver and played with his brothers in summer league games after work during this period johnson grew to a height of  and developed what some later described as rocket launcher legs which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents jim white the coach at los angeles harbor college had watched johnson play street basketball feeling that johnson excelled in defense white asked him to enroll johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard averaging  points and  rebounds per game and leading harbor to a college junior state title however the young guard lacked discipline often clashed with white and was thrown off the team three times in two years at the end of his junior college career two universities offered johnson scholarships azusa pacific university and pepperdine university johnson chose the latter and in his only year in college he averaged  points  rebounds and  assists per game and developed a reputation for tough defense after that year johnson made himself eligible for the  nba draft but was skeptical that any team would take him nba teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues and johnson was known to be a troublemaker professional careeredit seattle supersonics –edit the seattle supersonics took johnson in the second round of the  draft with the th pick and gave him a fouryear contract with which he earned a salary of  in the first year and  in the last in his rookie year the – nba season johnson playing backup to the experienced sonics backcourt tandem of slick watts and fred brown averaged  points and  assists per game the sonics finished with a – record and missed the  nba playoffs leading head coach bill russell to resign in the following season the team lost  of the first  games under russells replacement bob hopkins who was replaced by hall of fame coach lenny wilkens who gave johnson a starting spot and paired him with gus williams johnson revelled in this new role improving his averages to  points and  assists per game during this period johnson played shooting guard and was known for his aggressive slam dunking in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career it was at this time that johnsons nickname dj was coined by playbyplay announcer bob blackburn to help distinguish him from teammates john johnson and vinnie johnson whom blackburn referred to as jj and vj respectively finishing strongly the sonics ended the regular season with a – record and made the  nba playoffs after eliminating the los angeles lakers the defending champion portland trail blazers and the denver nuggets they almost defeated the washington bullets by taking a – lead in the  nba finals in a – game  victory johnson blocked seven shots—the most blocks in nba finals history for a guard the sonics lost in seven games however partly because of johnsons game  scoring drought in which the secondyear guard missed all of his  field goal attempts johnson later acknowledged that he simply choked he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player johnson and the sonics got their revenge in the – season after clinching the pacific division with a – record the team met the bullets again in the  nba finals after losing game  the sonics won the next four games to take the finals series helped by johnson who averaged almost  points along with six rebounds and assists per game he scored  points in a game  overtime victory and was named nba finals mvp it was during this season that johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league he averaged  points and  assists per game and made his first alldefensive first team and allstar game appearance during the following season johnson averaged  points and  assists appeared in his second allstar game and was named to the alldefensive first team and allnba second team the sonics however lost in the western conference finals to the lakers who had hall of famers jamaal wilkes magic johnson and kareem abduljabbar because of the abundance of talent on the sonics team johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career the sonics may well have won a nd straight championship in a third straight run to the finals but point guard gus williams held out that season he sought  million for a season a paltry sum by todays standards but the sonics refused to pay and it ultimately cost them their last shot at the finals for  more seasons coach wilkens grew tired of johnson who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability to the team at the end of the season johnson was traded to the phoenix suns for paul westphal and draft picks the sonics finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of westphal phoenix suns –edit johnson further established himself as a quality player in phoenix in his three years as a sun johnson averaged – points a game and provided tough defense he played in two allstar games was voted into three consecutive alldefensive first teams and earned his only allnba first team appearance in this period johnson like in seattle played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team as opposed to being the second or third option as a sonic in the first two years of johnsons stint the suns were fairly successful reaching the western conference semifinals both seasons the suns bowed out in the first round in johnsons last year johnsons situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at phoenix like in seattle he often clashed with his coach john macleod and finally was traded by general manager jerry colangelo to the boston celtics for rick robey and draft picks like seattle after johnsons departure the suns finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of robey boston celtics –edit between the – season and – season seasons the celtics had lost to the philadelphia ers in the eastern conference finals  out of  times mainly because physical sixers guard andrew toney routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt after subsequently getting swept by the bucks in the – eastern conference semifinals celtics general manager red auerbach added the perennial alldefensive team member johnson to his squad hoping that it would help the celtics fare better in the eastern conference playoffs particular against the ers johnson joined a squad led by hall of fame forward larry bird who played in the frontcourt with two fellow hall of famers center robert parish and forward kevin mchale a combination often called the best frontcourt of all time by the nba johnson described joining the celtics as a dream come true and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager auerbach who was living history according to johnson with the celtics johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career after being known as a slam dunking shooting guard with the sonics and an allaround scorer with the suns he now established himself as a point guard who was defined more by playmaking than scoring in his first year as a celtic he averaged  points and  assists and was elected to the alldefensive second team the celtics reached the  nba finals where they met the los angeles lakers their intense rivals since the s the celtics won – and johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on hall of fame lakers playmaker earvin johnson limiting him to a subaverage  points in the last four games and being at least partly responsible for several of the laker point guards gamedeciding errors in games   and  as a result magic johnson was taunted as tragic johnson whenever the lakers and celtics played against each other in the – season johnson continued playing smothering defense earning his next alldefensive second team callup while averaging  points and  assists per game the celtics met the lakers in the  nba finals again johnsons big moment came in game  when the score was tied at  teammate larry bird had the ball in the last seconds being doubleteamed by lakers kareem abduljabbar and magic johnson bird passed to the open johnson and the guard sank a ft buzzer beater to win the game the lakers however took their revenge this time winning the series in six games powered by venerable yearold finals mvp abduljabbar johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career because the celtics were close to winning the series but could not get the job done in the following season the celtics made the playoffs helped by the performance of johnson who made the alldefensive second team again while tallying  points and  assists per game after defeating the milwaukee bucks in the eastern conference finals the celtics reached the  nba finals against the upandcoming houston rockets led by the twin towers of centers ralph sampson and hakeem olajuwon led by finals mvp larry bird the celtics beat the rockets – and johnson won his third title the celtics were unable to repeat their title in  despite several dramatic playoff victories johnson played strong defense again earning yet another appearance on the alldefensive first team and the celtics embarked on a nailbiting playoff campaign in the  eastern conference semifinals the celtics split the first six games against the milwaukee bucks in the deciding game  which the celtics won johnson had a spectacular play with  left in the game a celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds but johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in midair against bucks center and former sonics teammate jack sikma the ball bounced off sikma before going out of bounds and the celtics maintained possession in the next round the  eastern conference finals the celtics faced the detroit pistons the series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals featuring a great level of personal animosity sharp rhetoric and several physical altercations the center of this feud was pistons pivot bill laimbeer who brawled with celtics players bird and parish in game  johnson was involved in a crucial play down  larry bird stole the inbounds pass by pistons point guard isiah thomas with  seconds left and passed it to a sprinting johnson who converted a difficult layup with  second left in the game this play caused celtics broadcaster johnny most to shout out one of his most famous calls “ now theres a steal by bird underneath to dj who lays it in right at one second left what a play by bird bird stole the inbounding pass laid it up to dj and dj laid it up and in and boston has a onepoint lead with one second left oh my this place is going crazy ” according to johnson this was his favorite play of alltime games  and  also featured a feud this time between pistons forward dennis rodman and johnson in game  which the pistons won rodman taunted johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head when the celtics took game  johnson went back at rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture in the  nba finals however the celtics succumbed to the los angeles lakers – as lakers playmaker and finals mvp magic johnson put up a great performance averaging  points and  assists throughout the series the next three seasons were disappointing for the aging celtics in the – season johnson averaged  points and  assists but in the  playoffs the celtics were unable to beat the detroit pistons in the eastern conference finals in the next season johnson who statistically declined to  points and  assists per game and his team made the  nba playoffs on a meager – record largely due to the absence of star forward larry bird for almost the entire season but were immediately eliminated in the first round again largely due to the absence of the injured larry bird the following – nba season was johnsons last the now yearold playmaker relinquished his starting point guard role to younger john bagley but when bagley dislocated his shoulder johnson returned with a high level of performance and was lovingly called our glue man by coach jimmy rodgers in that season johnson started in  of his  games averaging  points and  assists but the celtics failed to survive the first round of the  nba playoffs johnson retired after the celtics did not offer him a new contract at the beginning of the  season during his retirement ceremony his perennial los angeles lakers opponent magic johnson telegraphed him and lauded him as the best backcourt defender of alltime in addition celtics colleague and triple nba most valuable player award winner larry bird called johnson the best teammate he ever had postplayer careeredit after retiring as a player johnson worked as a scout for the celtics in  he became an assistant coach for the celtics a position he held until  after spending several years outside the limelight he returned as an assistant coach for the los angeles clippers in  and spent four seasons there for  games toward the end of the – season johnson served as interim head coach after the departure of alvin gentry johnson later worked as a scout for the portland trail blazers and in  he was named head coach of the nba development leagues florida flame he became head coach of the nbadls austin toros a

hall of fame as player dennis wayne johnson september   – february   nicknamed dj was an american professional basketball player for the national basketball associations nba seattle supersonics phoenix suns and boston celtics and coach of the los angeles clippers he was an alumnus of dominguez high school los angeles harbor college and pepperdine university a prototypical late bloomer johnson overcame early struggles and had a successful nba playing career drafted th overall in  by the seattle supersonics johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard he eventually led the sonics to their only nba championship in  winning the finals mvp award after a short stint with the phoenix suns he became the starting point guard for the boston celtics with whom he won two more championships johnson was voted into five allstar teams one allnba first and one second team and nine consecutive alldefensive first and second teams apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in nba playoffs history the celtics franchise has retired johnsons  jersey which hangs from the rafters of the td garden the home arena of the team on april   the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame officially announced that johnson had been posthumously elected to the hall he was formally inducted on august  he is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time contents  early years  professional career  seattle supersonics –  phoenix suns –  boston celtics –  postplayer career  head coaching record  legacy  personal life  death  see also  references  external links early yearsedit dennis wayne johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in compton california a suburb of los angeles originally a baseball fan and a little leaguer johnson learned basketball from his father but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers as a teenager at dominguez high school johnson measured just  and played only a minute or two each game after high school he worked several odd jobs including a perhour job as a forklift driver and played with his brothers in summer league games after work during this period johnson grew to a height of  and developed what some later described as rocket launcher legs which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents jim white the coach at los angeles harbor college had watched johnson play street basketball feeling that johnson excelled in defense white asked him to enroll johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard averaging  points and  rebounds per game and leading harbor to a college junior state title however the young guard lacked discipline often clashed with white and was thrown off the team three times in two years at the end of his junior college career two universities offered johnson scholarships azusa pacific university and pepperdine university johnson chose the latter and in his only year in college he averaged  points  rebounds and  assists per game and developed a reputation for tough defense after that year johnson made himself eligible for the  nba draft but was skeptical that any team would take him nba teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues and johnson was known to be a troublemaker professional careeredit seattle supersonics –edit the seattle supersonics took johnson in the second round of the  draft with the th pick and gave him a fouryear contract with which he earned a salary of  in the first year and  in the last in his rookie year the – nba season johnson playing backup to the experienced sonics backcourt tandem of slick watts and fred brown averaged  points and  assists per game the sonics finished with a – record and missed the  nba playoffs leading head coach bill russell to resign in the following season the team lost  of the first  games under russells replacement bob hopkins who was replaced by hall of fame coach lenny wilkens who gave johnson a starting spot and paired him with gus williams johnson revelled in this new role improving his averages to  points and  assists per game during this period johnson played shooting guard and was known for his aggressive slam dunking in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career it was at this time that johnsons nickname dj was coined by playbyplay announcer bob blackburn to help distinguish him from teammates john johnson and vinnie johnson whom blackburn referred to as jj and vj respectively finishing strongly the sonics ended the regular season with a – record and made the  nba playoffs after eliminating the los angeles lakers the defending champion portland trail blazers and the denver nuggets they almost defeated the washington bullets by taking a – lead in the  nba finals in a – game  victory johnson blocked seven shots—the most blocks in nba finals history for a guard the sonics lost in seven games however partly because of johnsons game  scoring drought in which the secondyear guard missed all of his  field goal attempts johnson later acknowledged that he simply choked he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player johnson and the sonics got their revenge in the – season after clinching the pacific division with a – record the team met the bullets again in the  nba finals after losing game  the sonics won the next four games to take the finals series helped by johnson who averaged almost  points along with six rebounds and assists per game he scored  points in a game  overtime victory and was named nba finals mvp it was during this season that johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league he averaged  points and  assists per game and made his first alldefensive first team and allstar game appearance during the following season johnson averaged  points and  assists appeared in his second allstar game and was named to the alldefensive first team and allnba second team the sonics however lost in the western conference finals to the lakers who had hall of famers jamaal wilkes magic johnson and kareem abduljabbar because of the abundance of talent on the sonics team johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career the sonics may well have won a nd straight championship in a third straight run to the finals but point guard gus williams held out that season he sought  million for a season a paltry sum by todays standards but the sonics refused to pay and it ultimately cost them their last shot at the finals for  more seasons coach wilkens grew tired of johnson who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability to the team at the end of the season johnson was traded to the phoenix suns for paul westphal and draft picks the sonics finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of westphal phoenix suns –edit johnson further established himself as a quality player in phoenix in his three years as a sun johnson averaged – points a game and provided tough defense he played in two allstar games was voted into three consecutive alldefensive first teams and earned his only allnba first team appearance in this period johnson like in seattle played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team as opposed to being the second or third option as a sonic in the first two years of johnsons stint the suns were fairly successful reaching the western conference semifinals both seasons the suns bowed out in the first round in johnsons last year johnsons situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at phoenix like in seattle he often clashed with his coach john macleod and finally was traded by general manager jerry colangelo to the boston celtics for rick robey and draft picks like seattle after johnsons departure the suns finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of robey boston celtics –edit between the – season and – season seasons the celtics had lost to the philadelphia ers in the eastern conference finals  out of  times mainly because physical sixers guard andrew toney routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt after subsequently getting swept by the bucks in the – eastern conference semifinals celtics general manager red auerbach added the perennial alldefensive team member johnson to his squad hoping that it would help the celtics fare better in the eastern conference playoffs particular against the ers johnson joined a squad led by hall of fame forward larry bird who played in the frontcourt with two fellow hall of famers center robert parish and forward kevin mchale a combination often called the best frontcourt of all time by the nba johnson described joining the celtics as a dream come true and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager auerbach who was living history according to johnson with the celtics johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career after being known as a slam dunking shooting guard with the sonics and an allaround scorer with the suns he now established himself as a point guard who was defined more by playmaking than scoring in his first year as a celtic he averaged  points and  assists and was elected to the alldefensive second team the celtics reached the  nba finals where they met the los angeles lakers their intense rivals since the s the celtics won – and johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on hall of fame lakers playmaker earvin johnson limiting him to a subaverage  points in the last four games and being at least partly responsible for several of the laker point guards gamedeciding errors in games   and  as a result magic johnson was taunted as tragic johnson whenever the lakers and celtics played against each other in the – season johnson continued playing smothering defense earning his next alldefensive second team callup while averaging  points and  assists per game the celtics met the lakers in the  nba finals again johnsons big moment came in game  when the score was tied at  teammate larry bird had the ball in the last seconds being doubleteamed by lakers kareem abduljabbar and magic johnson bird passed to the open johnson and the guard sank a ft buzzer beater to win the game the lakers however took their revenge this time winning the series in six games powered by venerable yearold finals mvp abduljabbar johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career because the celtics were close to winning the series but could not get the job done in the following season the celtics made the playoffs helped by the performance of johnson who made the alldefensive second team again while tallying  points and  assists per game after defeating the milwaukee bucks in the eastern conference finals the celtics reached the  nba finals against the upandcoming houston rockets led by the twin towers of centers ralph sampson and hakeem olajuwon led by finals mvp larry bird the celtics beat the rockets – and johnson won his third title the celtics were unable to repeat their title in  despite several dramatic playoff victories johnson played strong defense again earning yet another appearance on the alldefensive first team and the celtics embarked on a nailbiting playoff campaign in the  eastern conference semifinals the celtics split the first six games against the milwaukee bucks in the deciding game  which the celtics won johnson had a spectacular play with  left in the game a celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds but johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in midair against bucks center and former sonics teammate jack sikma the ball bounced off sikma before going out of bounds and the celtics maintained possession in the next round the  eastern conference finals the celtics faced the detroit pistons the series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals featuring a great level of personal animosity sharp rhetoric and several physical altercations the center of this feud was pistons pivot bill laimbeer who brawled with celtics players bird and parish in game  johnson was involved in a crucial play down  larry bird stole the inbounds pass by pistons point guard isiah thomas with  seconds left and passed it to a sprinting johnson who converted a difficult layup with  second left in the game this play caused celtics broadcaster johnny most to shout out one of his most famous calls “ now theres a steal by bird underneath to dj who lays it in right at one second left what a play by bird bird stole the inbounding pass laid it up to dj and dj laid it up and in and boston has a onepoint lead with one second left oh my this place is going crazy ” according to johnson this was his favorite play of alltime games  and  also featured a feud this time between pistons forward dennis rodman and johnson in game  which the pistons won rodman taunted johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head when the celtics took game  johnson went back at rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture in the  nba finals however the celtics succumbed to the los angeles lakers – as lakers playmaker and finals mvp magic johnson put up a great performance averaging  points and  assists throughout the series the next three seasons were disappointing for the aging celtics in the – season johnson averaged  points and  assists but in the  playoffs the celtics were unable to beat the detroit pistons in the eastern conference finals in the next season johnson who statistically declined to  points and  assists per game and his team made the  nba playoffs on a meager – record largely due to the absence of star forward larry bird for almost the entire season but were immediately eliminated in the first round again largely due to the absence of the injured larry bird the following – nba season was johnsons last the now yearold playmaker relinquished his starting point guard role to younger john bagley but when bagley dislocated his shoulder johnson returned with a high level of performance and was lovingly called our glue man by coach jimmy rodgers in that season johnson started in  of his  games averaging  points and  assists but the celtics failed to survive the first round of the  nba playoffs johnson retired after the celtics did not offer him a new contract at the beginning of the  season during his retirement ceremony his perennial los angeles lakers opponent magic johnson telegraphed him and lauded him as the best backcourt defender of alltime in addition celtics colleague and triple nba most valuable player award winner larry bird called johnson the best teammate he ever had postplayer careeredit after retiring as a player johnson worked as a scout for the celtics in  he became an assistant coach for the celtics a position he held until  after spending several years outside the limelight he returned as an assistant coach for the los angeles clippers in  and spent four seasons there for  games toward the end of the – season johnson served as interim head coach after the departure of alvin gentry johnson later worked as a scout for the portland trail blazers and in  he was named head coach of the nba development leagues florida flame he became head coach of the nbadls austin toros a

hall of fame as player dennis wayne johnson september   – february   nicknamed dj was an american professional basketball player for the national basketball associations nba seattle supersonics phoenix suns and boston celtics and coach of the los angeles clippers he was an alumnus of dominguez high school los angeles harbor college and pepperdine university a prototypical late bloomer johnson overcame early struggles and had a successful nba playing career drafted th overall in  by the seattle supersonics johnson began his professional career as a shooting guard he eventually led the sonics to their only nba championship in  winning the finals mvp award after a short stint with the phoenix suns he became the starting point guard for the boston celtics with whom he won two more championships johnson was voted into five allstar teams one allnba first and one second team and nine consecutive alldefensive first and second teams apart from his reputation as a defensive stopper johnson was known as a clutch player who made several decisive plays in nba playoffs history the celtics franchise has retired johnsons  jersey which hangs from the rafters of the td garden the home arena of the team on april   the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame officially announced that johnson had been posthumously elected to the hall he was formally inducted on august  he is considered by several sports journalists to be one of the most underrated players of all time contents  early years  professional career  seattle supersonics –  phoenix suns –  boston celtics –  postplayer career  head coaching record  legacy  personal life  death  see also  references  external links early yearsedit dennis wayne johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in compton california a suburb of los angeles originally a baseball fan and a little leaguer johnson learned basketball from his father but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers as a teenager at dominguez high school johnson measured just  and played only a minute or two each game after high school he worked several odd jobs including a perhour job as a forklift driver and played with his brothers in summer league games after work during this period johnson grew to a height of  and developed what some later described as rocket launcher legs which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents jim white the coach at los angeles harbor college had watched johnson play street basketball feeling that johnson excelled in defense white asked him to enroll johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard averaging  points and  rebounds per game and leading harbor to a college junior state title however the young guard lacked discipline often clashed with white and was thrown off the team three times in two years at the end of his junior college career two universities offered johnson scholarships azusa pacific university and pepperdine university johnson chose the latter and in his only year in college he averaged  points  rebounds and  assists per game and developed a reputation for tough defense after that year johnson made himself eligible for the  nba draft but was skeptical that any team would take him nba teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues and johnson was known to be a troublemaker professional careeredit seattle supersonics –edit the seattle supersonics took johnson in the second round of the  draft with the th pick and gave him a fouryear contract with which he earned a salary of  in the first year and  in the last in his rookie year the – nba season johnson playing backup to the experienced sonics backcourt tandem of slick watts and fred brown averaged  points and  assists per game the sonics finished with a – record and missed the  nba playoffs leading head coach bill russell to resign in the following season the team lost  of the first  games under russells replacement bob hopkins who was replaced by hall of fame coach lenny wilkens who gave johnson a starting spot and paired him with gus williams johnson revelled in this new role improving his averages to  points and  assists per game during this period johnson played shooting guard and was known for his aggressive slam dunking in contrast to the more cerebral roles he played later in his career it was at this time that johnsons nickname dj was coined by playbyplay announcer bob blackburn to help distinguish him from teammates john johnson and vinnie johnson whom blackburn referred to as jj and vj respectively finishing strongly the sonics ended the regular season with a – record and made the  nba playoffs after eliminating the los angeles lakers the defending champion portland trail blazers and the denver nuggets they almost defeated the washington bullets by taking a – lead in the  nba finals in a – game  victory johnson blocked seven shots—the most blocks in nba finals history for a guard the sonics lost in seven games however partly because of johnsons game  scoring drought in which the secondyear guard missed all of his  field goal attempts johnson later acknowledged that he simply choked he vowed never to repeat this again and credited this game as an important lesson to become a better player johnson and the sonics got their revenge in the – season after clinching the pacific division with a – record the team met the bullets again in the  nba finals after losing game  the sonics won the next four games to take the finals series helped by johnson who averaged almost  points along with six rebounds and assists per game he scored  points in a game  overtime victory and was named nba finals mvp it was during this season that johnson established himself as one of the best guards in the league he averaged  points and  assists per game and made his first alldefensive first team and allstar game appearance during the following season johnson averaged  points and  assists appeared in his second allstar game and was named to the alldefensive first team and allnba second team the sonics however lost in the western conference finals to the lakers who had hall of famers jamaal wilkes magic johnson and kareem abduljabbar because of the abundance of talent on the sonics team johnson later called this loss one of the worst disappointments of his professional career the sonics may well have won a nd straight championship in a third straight run to the finals but point guard gus williams held out that season he sought  million for a season a paltry sum by todays standards but the sonics refused to pay and it ultimately cost them their last shot at the finals for  more seasons coach wilkens grew tired of johnson who often clashed with him and was perceived as a growing liability to the team at the end of the season johnson was traded to the phoenix suns for paul westphal and draft picks the sonics finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of westphal phoenix suns –edit johnson further established himself as a quality player in phoenix in his three years as a sun johnson averaged – points a game and provided tough defense he played in two allstar games was voted into three consecutive alldefensive first teams and earned his only allnba first team appearance in this period johnson like in seattle played shooting guard and became the main scorer on the team as opposed to being the second or third option as a sonic in the first two years of johnsons stint the suns were fairly successful reaching the western conference semifinals both seasons the suns bowed out in the first round in johnsons last year johnsons situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at phoenix like in seattle he often clashed with his coach john macleod and finally was traded by general manager jerry colangelo to the boston celtics for rick robey and draft picks like seattle after johnsons departure the suns finished  games worse in the next season despite the addition of robey boston celtics –edit between the – season and – season seasons the celtics had lost to the philadelphia ers in the eastern conference finals  out of  times mainly because physical sixers guard andrew toney routinely caused problems for their defensively fragile backcourt after subsequently getting swept by the bucks in the – eastern conference semifinals celtics general manager red auerbach added the perennial alldefensive team member johnson to his squad hoping that it would help the celtics fare better in the eastern conference playoffs particular against the ers johnson joined a squad led by hall of fame forward larry bird who played in the frontcourt with two fellow hall of famers center robert parish and forward kevin mchale a combination often called the best frontcourt of all time by the nba johnson described joining the celtics as a dream come true and enjoyed the tutelage of highly successful general manager auerbach who was living history according to johnson with the celtics johnson changed his playing style for the third time in his career after being known as a slam dunking shooting guard with the sonics and an allaround scorer with the suns he now established himself as a point guard who was defined more by playmaking than scoring in his first year as a celtic he averaged  points and  assists and was elected to the alldefensive second team the celtics reached the  nba finals where they met the los angeles lakers their intense rivals since the s the celtics won – and johnson took credit for playing smothering defense on hall of fame lakers playmaker earvin johnson limiting him to a subaverage  points in the last four games and being at least partly responsible for several of the laker point guards gamedeciding errors in games   and  as a result magic johnson was taunted as tragic johnson whenever the lakers and celtics played against each other in the – season johnson continued playing smothering defense earning his next alldefensive second team callup while averaging  points and  assists per game the celtics met the lakers in the  nba finals again johnsons big moment came in game  when the score was tied at  teammate larry bird had the ball in the last seconds being doubleteamed by lakers kareem abduljabbar and magic johnson bird passed to the open johnson and the guard sank a ft buzzer beater to win the game the lakers however took their revenge this time winning the series in six games powered by venerable yearold finals mvp abduljabbar johnson described this loss as one of the toughest in his career because the celtics were close to winning the series but could not get the job done in the following season the celtics made the playoffs helped by the performance of johnson who made the alldefensive second team again while tallying  points and  assists per game after defeating the milwaukee bucks in the eastern conference finals the celtics reached the  nba finals against the upandcoming houston rockets led by the twin towers of centers ralph sampson and hakeem olajuwon led by finals mvp larry bird the celtics beat the rockets – and johnson won his third title the celtics were unable to repeat their title in  despite several dramatic playoff victories johnson played strong defense again earning yet another appearance on the alldefensive first team and the celtics embarked on a nailbiting playoff campaign in the  eastern conference semifinals the celtics split the first six games against the milwaukee bucks in the deciding game  which the celtics won johnson had a spectacular play with  left in the game a celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds but johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in midair against bucks center and former sonics teammate jack sikma the ball bounced off sikma before going out of bounds and the celtics maintained possession in the next round the  eastern conference finals the celtics faced the detroit pistons the series was described as a grudge match between two intense rivals featuring a great level of personal animosity sharp rhetoric and several physical altercations the center of this feud was pistons pivot bill laimbeer who brawled with celtics players bird and parish in game  johnson was involved in a crucial play down  larry bird stole the inbounds pass by pistons point guard isiah thomas with  seconds left and passed it to a sprinting johnson who converted a difficult layup with  second left in the game this play caused celtics broadcaster johnny most to shout out one of his most famous calls “ now theres a steal by bird underneath to dj who lays it in right at one second left what a play by bird bird stole the inbounding pass laid it up to dj and dj laid it up and in and boston has a onepoint lead with one second left oh my this place is going crazy ” according to johnson this was his favorite play of alltime games  and  also featured a feud this time between pistons forward dennis rodman and johnson in game  which the pistons won rodman taunted johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head when the celtics took game  johnson went back at rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture in the  nba finals however the celtics succumbed to the los angeles lakers – as lakers playmaker and finals mvp magic johnson put up a great performance averaging  points and  assists throughout the series the next three seasons were disappointing for the aging celtics in the – season johnson averaged  points and  assists but in the  playoffs the celtics were unable to beat the detroit pistons in the eastern conference finals in the next season johnson who statistically declined to  points and  assists per game and his team made the  nba playoffs on a meager – record largely due to the absence of star forward larry bird for almost the entire season but were immediately eliminated in the first round again largely due to the absence of the injured larry bird the following – nba season was johnsons last the now yearold playmaker relinquished his starting point guard role to younger john bagley but when bagley dislocated his shoulder johnson returned with a high level of performance and was lovingly called our glue man by coach jimmy rodgers in that season johnson started in  of his  games averaging  points and  assists but the celtics failed to survive the first round of the  nba playoffs johnson retired after the celtics did not offer him a new contract at the beginning of the  season during his retirement ceremony his perennial los angeles lakers opponent magic johnson telegraphed him and lauded him as the best backcourt defender of alltime in addition celtics colleague and triple nba most valuable player award winner larry bird called johnson the best teammate he ever had postplayer careeredit after retiring as a player johnson worked as a scout for the celtics in  he became an assistant coach for the celtics a position he held until  after spending several years outside the limelight he returned as an assistant coach for the los angeles clippers in  and spent four seasons there for  games toward the end of the – season johnson served as interim head coach after the departure of alvin gentry johnson later worked as a scout for the portland trail blazers and in  he was named head coach of the nba development leagues florida flame he became head coach of the nbadls austin toros a
