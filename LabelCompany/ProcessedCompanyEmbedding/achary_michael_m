todays call by saying how proud i am of our associates and our management team weve set some very aggressive goals early last year and as we noted in our release yesterday we met both of our expense targets for  not only did we meet the first quarters target we also met the fourth quarters goal  quarters ahead of schedule but as i noted in my quote in the release we are not done we still have work to do to meet the second part of our initiative a sustainable efficiency ratio for  of  or lower with expenses in line in order to meet our goal we will need to generate additional revenue that means that over the next couple of quarters you may see expenses rise slightly as we reinvest in higherreturn revenuegenerating lines of business we will use some of the savings from the divestiture of our pc and group benefits insurance lines we announced a couple of weeks ago and as we noted in the release we are continuing our branch rationalization program and closing more locations across our footprint but at the same time were closing branches we are also opening new locations we just opened a regional headquarters in lafayette louisiana a significant market for the oil and gas business and in a few weeks we will be opening business financial centers in houston texas and jacksonville florida to support our strategic business focus for those markets and we have plans on the table to open additional branches and bfcs in more markets during  while you see us investing it is also important to note that we remain committed to keep the expenses under control and in line with our stated goal for the fourth quarter of  yesterday we reported first quarter earnings of  million or  per share and an roa of  we continue the trend of replacing purchase accounting income with core earnings a combination of lower operating expenses and stability in the net interest margin helped improve the overall quality of our earnings operating expenses declined  million linked quarter and compared to our starting point a year ago operating expenses are down almost  million or  the efficiency ratio improved to  down from  last quarter core net interest income was flat linked quarter while the core net interest margin narrowed  basis points we had over  million in linkedquarter net loan growth or  annualized and approximately  billion or  yearoveryear loan growth each excluding the fdiccovered portfolio there was continued improvement in our overall asset quality metrics and as i noted earlier our roa improved to  and our return on tce was over  with purchase accounting continuing to run off it is important for us to continue our efforts to replace it with core earnings and were committed to doing just that while we work on revenuegenerating projects eps may remain flat in the near term but the quality of our earnings will continue to improve at this time ill turn the call over to our cfo mike achary who will review some of the quarters results in more detail michael m achary thanks carl and good morning everyone total loans for the company at the end of the first quarter were  billion that was up just over  million from year end we back out and exclude the covered loan portfolio total loans were actually up  million or  linkedquarter annualized we are pleased with the quarters loan growth which exceeded our own seasonal expectations of flat growth the loan portfolio increased in most of our markets across the footprint with the majority of that growth in houston southwest louisiana mississippi and central florida the growth was diversified across all of our product lines and we are encouraged by the activity in all of our markets while ci was the biggest driver of the dollar increase the mix continued to improve with cre loans making up almost  of new loan originations construction lending was also up with residential mortgage loans increasing slightly as a result of the first quarters activity we have increased our outlook for loan growth in  from a mid singledigit increase to an upper singledigit increase the first quarter also saw higher levels of payoffs and paydowns with also very healthy levels of new loan origination activity while new loans were booked at levels just under  the runoff rate was higher compressing the core loan yield by  basis points and in turn causing a slight basispoint compression in the core nim however the additional loan volume during the first quarter did help offset the loss in net interest income from  fewer accrual days this quarter nonperforming assets net chargeoffs criticized loans and classified loans were all down linked quarter the total provision for loan losses was virtually unchanged from last quarter the change in the allowance for loan losses reflected a net reversal of previous impairment on fdiccovered loans partly offset by an increase in the allowance on the noncovered loan portfolio with continued loan growth in the future the natural migration of some acquired loans to the originated portfolio and the accretion of the remaining discount we do expect to continue to build the allowance on the noncovered loan portfolio total deposits for the company at march  were  billion that was down  million from year end decline was mainly related to seasonal public fund balances which were down  million linked quarter we reported continued stability in our core and reported net interest income and net interest margin on a reported basis net interest income was basically unchanged from last quarter despite a decline of  in loan accretion core net interest income was also flat linked quarter the companys average earning assets were up  million linked quarter reflecting the significant loan growth at the end of the fourth quarter and into the current quarter the reported margin and core net interest margin both narrowed  basis points in the first quarter the core loan yield the  did decline  basis points and reflects the comments and repricing we mentioned earlier this compression was partly offset by an improvement in the yield in the bond portfolio of  basis points our funding costs were flat at  basis points noninterest income for the company total  million that was down  million from the fourth quarter amortization of the indemnification asset totaled  million in the first quarter compared to  million last quarter this increase reflects a lower level of expected future losses on covered loans we do expect continued ia amortization through  but at a slightly lower level service charges and card fees together were down about  million from last quarter partly due to the shorter quarter trust investment and insurance fees totaled  million and were up  linked quarter included in that total was  million of insurance revenue as a reminder we announced the divestiture of our pc and group benefits insurance lines a couple of weeks ago insurance related revenue and expense are both expected to decline by less than  million per quarter beginning in the second quarter operating expenses for the first quarter totaled  million this was also our targeted goal for expenses in the fourth quarter of  so as carl mentioned earlier we were able to achieve our expense goal  quarters early expenses were down just over  million linked quarter excluding  million of onetime costs last quarter expense reductions were broadbased and reflected the combination of our efficiency activities which weve been sharing with the market the last few quarters these activities included a full quarters impact from recent branch sales and closures reorganization of market leadership procurement activities as well as process improvement and enabling technology initiatives all of these aforementioned items will not stop now that weve achieved our expense goal early for example branch rationalization is an ongoing process but we continue to open close and consolidate branches when warranted yesterday we announced we will close an additional  branch locations in mississippi florida and louisiana in early third quarter  however as carl noted in his comments we also are opening new branches and business financial centers at the same time so the takeaway here is that while most of the heavy lifting in terms of expense reductions is now in the rearview mirror we will continue with our efficiency efforts to create funding for revenue initiatives so ahead of us is continued investment in revenue initiatives and revenue growth all with the focus on achieving our stated goals i will now turn the call back over to carl carl j chaney thanks mike before i open the call for questions id like to end on capital our tce ratio was  at march  up  basis points from where we were a year ago even with a  million of capital spent on the current  buyback program the current asr transaction will be completed in may and based on current stock prices we expect to receive approximately  additional shares to close the transaction we will continue to review future opportunities to manage our strong capital position in the best interest of our shareholders including additional stock buybacks organic growth acquisitions and increased dividends we will now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james michael rose  raymond james  associates inc research division as we think about going into  with  being kind of a transition year and as you get towards your  or move towards your longerterm efficiency target of  to  should we think about more the efficiency improvement in  coming from revenue as opposed to expenses and then what are some of the areas outside of some of the new branches that youre going to open that you would invest some of the cost savings into michael m achary thank you michael this is mike achary yes again i think you hit the nail in the head certainly   or  again is a bit of a transition year as we harvested our expense savings as weve done but then also continue the good work to create opportunity to invest in revenue initiatives thats happening now that will continue as we move through  and were really looking for  to be the year where we really begin to show that incremental revenue growth that helps us achieve those targets for  so we talked a lot about i think some of the efficiency improvements that weve made in the company some of the things that help our lenders and relationship managers create more opportunities to be facetoface with their customers thats also involving things that help us remove some of the burdens of the daytoday operations that those folks have so again that they can focus on good customer contact on  with their customers so going forward the things that i think youll see us invest in will be things that actually help us add where its appropriate in certain markets relationship managers that help us with our commercial middle market and corporate banking customers youll see us add some resources that help us with our mutual fund complex in terms of wholesalers we have a whole host of initiatives pointed at fee income much of that is wealth management but then also treasury services and those are the areas that well continue to invest in carl talked earlier about the bfcs that were opening and look for more to come in that regard as we head down the road and then finally i think i already kind of mentioned this but additional automation that really helps us become a more efficient company again with respect to customer contact freeing up time for our lenders to spend more face time with good customers so thats really kind of how were thinking about this year and into next year michael rose  raymond james  associates inc research division okay and then just a followup for carl you mentioned the  tangible common ratio i know  i think your goal is around  where youd like to optimally operate can you discuss the interplay between thoughts on future share buybacks and maybe potential ma opportunities carl j chaney sure michael we  i can assure you every board meeting that we have we have a healthy dialogue and discussion about our options the nice thing is that we have ample options to manage our capital down to where it needs to be in the best of our shareholders so were continuing  are continuously looking at ma opportunities as well as running numbers for additional buybacks so we look at that every board meeting literally every board meeting we discuss it and the nice thing as i mentioned is we have options and feel very confident in our ability to execute on one or more of the options that we have to continue to manage our capital operator our next question comes from the line of jefferson harralson with kbw jefferson harralson  keefe bruyette  woods inc research division i want to ask a quick question on a couple of different things one is the  your guidance for a flat eps in the near term when you say that are you  do you mean q or do you mean a handful of quarters because it does seem like you have some purchase accounting headwind affecting you in the back half of the year michael m achary yes jefferson this is mike when we talk about that guidance it really is for the next couple of quarters so the next  or  quarters and youre right we do have a headwind of the diminishing level of purchase accounting between fourth quarter and first quarter that impact was about  as we head into the second quarter probably another  or  of kind of projected diminishment but then as we head into the back half of  those diminishment levels will pick up a bit so right now were looking at somewhere in neighborhood of about  million of purchase accounting diminishment in each of the third and fourth quarter so obviously were looking to make that up with all of the efficiency initiatives that we kind of talked about a little bit earlier so again thats a mix of continuing to reduce expenses where appropriate to create funding for revenue initiatives and then certainly were looking for some of those revenue initiatives to begin a payback period little bit later this year jefferson harralson  keefe bruyette  woods inc research division all right then ill just ask on the revenue initiatives will be the key to getting where you want to be i think in  you mentioned better loan growth where is that coming from and what are you seeing there and what are the other maybe  or  main revenue initiatives that need to occur to  for you guys to meet your  goals carl j chaney well with the loan growth  jeff this is carl loan growth we expect to continue to originate where weve had recent success which is really all across our footprint all  states generating nice loan growth and so were fortunate to be operating in markets that are doing very well economically from the driving oil and gas industry in texas as well as south louisiana to the nice recovery were seeing in central florida from tampa to jacksonville so  and then on the mississippi coast we had some nice loan growth so we really do expect to see continued growth in those markets as those economies continue to grow and improve michael m achary and yes carl just to add to that we saw that over the last  quarters again with a pretty broad base increase in lending activity really across our footprint and we certainly expect that to continue going forward we also have the initiatives that i kind of mentioned in  at the onset of the call a few minutes ago and thats pretty broadbased and involves both our margin business as well as our fee income business and on the fee income side again treasury services and wealth management are really the  big areas that were looking to show revenue increases in the future carl j chaney yes in addition to the loan piece right indiscernible operator our next question comes from the line of emlen harmon with jefferies emlen b harmon  jefferies llc research division so pretty strong loan growth in a quarter where you guys are typically seeing softer growth could you give us a sense of what youre seeing on originations the past couple of quarters just whether those are picking up or the  whether the loan growth that weve seen is more an effect of just not as much runoff in some of your loan books michael m achary weve had really good production in the last couple of quarters and very pleased with that aspect of our activity paydowns have been a little bit uneven quartertoquarter and certainly in the fourth quarter we saw a little bit in the way of lessening of that and i think when we get to the first quarter as we get to the first quarter probably back into more of a normalized level of paydowns carl j chaney yes i would say that in the first quarter we actually had our typical paydowns its just that we were able to have very strong loan originations which allowed that typical first quarter softening of net loan growth to not occur this time so originations to your point have been very strong for the last couple of quarters in a row emlen b harmon  jefferies llc research division got you and are you  did  the loan growth that you guys are seeing is that marketshare driven or do you feel like theres actually  the market the lending market is actually growing as a whole samuel b kendricks this is sam i would put it in both of those categories were seeing improvements in economic activity in some of our key markets as well as the fact that were picking up some relationships that we think are meaningful and so were seeing acquisition of relationships as well as a general lift of the tide so to speak in some of these markets so were very encouraged on both those fronts emlen b harmon  jefferies llc research division got you and mike just one last quick one excuse me you gave us the revenue impact from the insurance sale is there anything that we should be thinking about taking out on the expense side as well michael m achary yes we talked a little bit earlier about a  million quarterly impact both on the revenue side as well as the expense side emlen b harmon  jefferies llc research division got you michael m achary that would be the way to think about it going forward operator our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with suntrust robinson jennifer h demba  suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division my questions have really been answered but i do have a question on the new offices that you said you plan on opening soon in houston and jacksonville how do those offices  can you just describe those offices are they just a business branch or how does that differ from a regular branch carl j chaney yes jennifer this is carl those are  we call those business financial centers and i apologize sometimes we use the acronym bfcs those are commercialoriented branches and so when you walk in they should not look like a typical retail branch in the sense that you dont see a large teller line rather you walk in it looks like a business office with professional desk around we also do accepting in deposits and do transactions but it certainly doesnt look like a retail branch it is clearly focused on commercial lending and commercial banking and so its  and theyre typically located in business complexes office complexes oftentimes in the first floor of a office tower and we have  opening up in a matter of just a couple of weeks one in houston and one in jacksonville and those  that represents our strategy for markets like that where we dont have a very large market share were going in with a very niche strategy play and going after commercial and highend private banking and so that has worked for us in the past and so were very confident well be able to continue to lever off of that strategy as opposed to markets like new orleans baton rouge the mississippi coast where we have large market share we have your typical retail branches as well as our strong commercial activity michael m achary and carl that was actually all part of our kind of strategic realignment that we talked about a year ago carl j chaney yes jennifer h demba  suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division okay and my second question is on ma can you just talk about the pipeline as it stands now and remind us of what kind of deals youre examining and youre willing to pursue and have you backed away from any opportunities in the last  to  months carl j chaney id say the ma market or activity has  is continuing to grow it is not  im not going to say its taking off but it is growing slightly gradually maybe is the best way to describe it i will say that the quality of the books that were starting to see continues to improve whereas  months ago i would tell you the quality was significantly less so thats encouraging as far as our sweet spot we can do up to  billion  billion of acquisition fairly easily but thats not our sweet spot were going  i would describe our ideal target being anywhere from  billion to  billion up to  billion or  billion that is our sweet spot we could do one of those transactions and fold that in very nicely and not have it be a major distraction and continue with our other initiatives which are important so while we have  were still looking forward to continuing to grow our revenue we like to look at those smaller acquisition opportunities at the same time that could fold in have we backed off weve  i guessed weve passed i think maybe this is what you were referring to there have been  fairly recent deals that we looked at and decided to pass on just because theyre  they werent strategic in our mind but one nice thing jennifer is we dont have to do a transaction right now and so that allows us to be patient and be very deliberate and  in our ma thoughts and so we would  we will pull the trigger when the right strategic opportunity presents itself in and were very confident that that will occur jennifer h demba  suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division i have one more question if i can if you were to look at an opportunity in texas would it have to be in a houston or dallas and whats your thought on that market in general carl j chaney i mean houston market is fantastic as far as how the economy is working and our results in that market have been very very strong and positive if something were to come available in houston and it had also some branches lets just say in dallas thats not a no go we can certainly  wed certainly do that easily now if it was something in west texas thats not really in our radar screen right now thats another thing thats  were fortunate about is that we are already in markets that we believe will provide ample opportunities for strategic expansion without having to go significantly outside of our existing footprint operator our next question comes from the line of matthew clark with crédit suisse matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division i guess first question really on the core margin outlook i mean i think there had been some expectation for things stabilizing there with the mix change and i think pricing has incrementally gotten better that differential has closed can you just give us a sense for how you see that core margin going forward and maybe also what kind of pricing youre seeing quartertoquarter michael m achary matt this is mike again if you look back over the last  quarters especially our core net interest margin really has been kind of the picture of stability weve had a quarter or  where were maybe up a couple of basis points this quarter we were down a couple of basis points and weve been able to achieve that more recently through the volumes that weve been able to put on the balance sheet on a net basis and also an improvement in the mix of loans that were putting on the balance sheet so a little bit fuller mix all of that is taking place in what continues to be a very challenging environment to price loans and that will continue going forward so were going to have that challenge and were going to have  a little bit of that potential for a little bit in the way of a downward movement in our core loan yields so our objective is to obviously maintain that core nim stability and to continue to grow our levels of net interest income and we think as we go through the year well be able to achieve that so again we may see the net interest margin the core net interest margin trend down a basis point or  as we go through the rest of the year but the objective is to increase our level of net interest income matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division got it okay and then as you look beyond say the next couple of quarters and i guess im just trying to get at maybe the underlying assumptions behind achieving that  to  core efficiency ratio in  i guess when we think about expenses beyond this year i mean is it fair to assume that theyre going to be flat or down and i guess what type of  i understand some of the initiatives that are in place on the revenue side but also just trying to get a sense for your assumptions on maybe rates and any  maybe pickup from the type of growth  of a loan growth that youre putting on today michael m achary well going forward on the expense side again as weve kind of talked about were continuing our efficiency efforts and we intend to continue to do that to create funding opportunities to invest back in the company so again going forward well be very careful and transparent to kind of show what those actions and activities have been and i think what well see is once you kind of back out the investments that weve made youll see just kind of a marginal continued increase in expenses somewhere in line with the rate of general inflation so theres always going to be a little bit in the way of expense increases that are just kind of baked into the numbers for that reason going forward and as far as the second question about the revenue component again weve talked a lot about that were very focused on continuing the level of loan growth that weve put in place the last couple of quarters increasing that going forward and at the same time investing in revenuegenerating initiatives many of which are pointed squarely at our fee income lines of business and again wealth management so trusts and investments are big areas that were investing in as well as treasury management matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division okay but no change in rates in  i mean do you assume some benefit of higher rates or no michael m achary no im sorry no again when we set up these targets a year ago they were under the assumption that while certainly an increase in the interest rate environment would help us its not something were counting on so by the time we get to  if we havent had a rate increase you know that the goals are still out there and our intent is to achieve those goals matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division okay and then just a housekeeping item how much of that  the latest increase in ci came from the shared national credits carl j chaney lets see in terms of the total increase in overall loans it was less than  the total loans on the ci piece lets see here i believe its  im not sure ive got that number handy here michael m achary i believe it was in the  million to  million range right operator our next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens matt olney  stephens inc research division i want to go back to matts question on the core margin can you guys disclose what the average yield is on the new and renewed production for the first quarter and how has this changed from the previous quarters michael m achary yes matt if we look back over the last couple of quarters it really is showing a little bit of an upward trend again its not linear quartertoquarter but the yield that new loans came on the books last quarter was right around  basis points and that has moved up to about  or so this quarter matt olney  stephens inc research division okay mike and going back to the sale of the business line within the insurance business are sales of other businesses still on the table at this point or would this just be limited to just the insurance business carl j chaney matt its carl i would say that  i wouldnt expect any additional sales of lines going forward we  as im  i guess it was our annual shareholder meeting  days ago and i had a question similar to that and i responded like this we stack rank all of our lines of business from a profitability standpoint and from a profit margin and while our commercial insurance loan business was profitable it was at the very bottom of that stacking and so we feel very very comfortable and confident in our ability to sell that for a nice premium turn around and take that investment and reinvest that into higher profit margin lines of business that were currently operating in that we know we can do very very well and so thats  in its most simplest terms thats exactly what we executed and we feel very confident in our ability to generate significantly more revenue and  that flows to the bottom line than we  with a similar investment than we were generating with the commercial insurance line so i dont see though  looking at the other stack rankings i dont see any other lines of business that it would necessarily make strategic to exit in order to reinvest as we did the commercial insurance michael m achary and carl that really is kind of what were doing in a way with our branch network carl j chaney absolutely yes moving  particularly those markets where  large markets where we have relatively small market share moving away from the retail strategy and the retail branch and taking that money and thats not an expense play but thats reinvesting that money into more strategic business financial centers where we know we can be much more profitable so again thats a similar concept that were executing operator our next question comes from the line of chris marinac with fig partners christopher w marinac  fig partners llc research division given the comment in the press release about the return on assets at  i guess im curious if directionally we should see this get better next year with these investments mike is that realistic michael m achary yes thats correct christopher w marinac  fig partners llc research division okay great and then if you or carl just talk to us a little bit about the priorities in between buyback dividend and ma and could you rank those or is there a sort of one thats preferred over the others carl j chaney i  chris i dont know if i would  if i can really give you a priority the priority is we will do  we will execute on one if not both of those i feel pretty confident that  because we have very strong capital as everyone seems to point out which is not a bad thing it does create nice options for us and we will manage that capital in a fashion that we think is in the best interest of our shareholders and so to be able to say  to prioritize between ma and stock buybacks we dont have a deal in hand and so no id say i couldnt rank those one over the other ill just say that were going to pursue both and make the right strategic decisions christopher w marinac  fig partners llc research division okay great and then maybe just a final point where are you on the stress test process and sort of whats coming out coming forward on that process michael m achary when you say stress test you mean the dfast requirements right chris christopher w marinac  fig partners llc research division right yes michael m achary we filed our dfast results a couple of weeks ago and so that is done and behind us and i suppose like most other banks out there were going through a review from our examiners which is a kind of normal and customary thing and that will conclude that process for this year and of course thats kind of a continuous process not only the dfast stress testing but our normal stress testing that we do as part of our capital management and capital planning process christopher w marinac  fig partners llc research division and youre still waiting to hear back feedback in terms of what capital impact there is if any michael m achary whats that now from the examiners or christopher w marinac  fig partners llc research division correct michael m achary yes and again given the size that we are the  billion to  billion banks i dont know that the examiners are going to come back and give pass or fail grades or anything of that nature it really is just an effort to comply with the regulations and to help us assess our capital going forward against the different scenarios that have been established carl j chaney we dont anticipate any issues coming out of that whatsoever michael m achary not at all carl j chaney we have a very close relationship with all of our regulatory authorities and obviously theyve been very closely aligned to us as weve been going through this process of the stress testing dfast and submitting that we dont anticipate any issues coming out of it whatsoever michael m achary and then just as a reminder also and again this is in accordance with the dfast regulations or doddfrank theres no public disclosure of those results for this year for next year however in one form or another some form of the results are projected to be or scheduled to be disclosed but nothing for this year operator our next question comes from the line of mikhail goberman with portales partners mikhail goberman  portales partners llc i was wondering if you guys could perhaps give some color on energy lending and trends in that space in houston and louisiana carl j chaney yes sir the  that segment continues to be very strong weve had opportunities to continue to expand in that space its not the primary driver of our growth this quarter obviously but were seeing continued strength there between the production side as well as the support industries so weve got a broad base of clients and industries that support energy in general whether its upstream for the exploration production or its nondrilling support or direct drilling support or just the other support industries transportation product transportation et cetera so were seeing pretty broadbased opportunities across the whole  entire energy segment mikhail goberman  portales partners llc great and if i can just circle back to the insurance divestment im sorry if this is kind of a repetition of maybe something you went over so you said the insurance fees are going to be down about  million beginning in q michael m achary thats correct thats correct mikhail goberman  portales partners llc from the current level of  million is that right michael m achary thats right yes operator our next question comes from the line of peyton green with sterne agee peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division a question i was wondering mike if you could touch on maybe what the headcount was for the combined company in the first quarter maybe if you could frame that in the context of where it was a year ago and a quarter ago michael m achary yes right now peyton our headcount this is on a fte basis is just under  so if we go back a year to the first quarter of  we were just under  so were down yeartoyear about  peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division okay and  so i mean thats flat versus the fourth quarter and yet  i mean theres a big change in personnel expense i mean  million linked quarter was there any kind of bonus accrual that got reversed out that maybe you had accrued over the last year that was due that didnt get paid in the first quarter or maybe  because i mean thats a huge change just on a fairly limited headcount reduction in the personnel expense michael m achary no no significant accruals this quarter or really last quarter or reversals or adjustments i think what youre seeing here is really the full quarter impact again of all the activities and actions that we really began executing on as we went through the fourth quarter of last year so again the numbers that i quoted really were endofperiod numbers and so again it really is a full quarters impact the very thing that weve done and put into place that make sense peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division yes  no i guess i mean just compared to  i know back in the old old days   years ago when you all did a  reduction in force i mean the effect of that was not as dramatic on a per fte basis i guess is just the way im thinking about it so it just seemed like there might have been something else going on but all right and so you would expect there to be a little bit more downside on that number based on the insurance company being  i mean the pc brokerage business moving out plus the branches but the branch closures would be offset by investment in other noninterest income businesses michael m achary thats correct thats exactly the way were thinking about it and again at the very onset of the call we mentioned some of the initiatives and many of those initiatives involve bringing into the company new relationship managers where appropriate and we believe necessary peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division okay great was there anything in the other line that you might caution us to use the  million as the run rate or is that a good run rate plus a little inflation going forward michael m achary no it really is a pretty good run rate and one of the things that we strove for and obviously i think we were able to achieve this quarter is the expense reductions werent aggregated up into one category or one market or one line item on the income statement it was pretty broadbased and so it represented again the culmination of all the things that weve been talking about and talked about a little bit earlier in the call all really manifested itself in a full quarters impact in the first quarter which is again the way we had kind of set up the plan of the program peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division okay and then i guess on the personnel not to be a stickler about this but i guess ive kind of forgotten when are the merit bases  merit pay raises that you would normally incur was that in the first quarter or is that a second quarter michael m achary no and again we do have a merit increase process or salary evaluation process that typically happens sometime in the middle of the second quarter of every year but again salary review and salary administration is something that takes place throughout the year so its not necessarily like maybe the old days you were referring to where everybody in the company got a raise on a certain day it really  we have really strove to kind of spread that out and make that a kind of continuous process having said that there will be some salary increases thatll be reflected in the second quarter numbers peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division okay all right and then separately in terms of the deposit growth in the quarter i know historically on your side on the hancock legacy side of the business there was pretty good seasonality michael m achary yes peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division on the deposit flows in first quarter that would roll out by the end of the first quarter how would you guide us to think about earning asset growth maybe in the second and third quarters in the context of that michael m achary yes and youre exactly right and i think we mentioned a little bit earlier some of the seasonality in the public fund book which was kind of a legacy hancock attribute so sure enough i mean were seeing those impacts as we go through the first quarter and even on the whitney legacy side now typically youd see a little bit of an increase in primarily the corporate deposits that would happen around year end and then a little bit of an outflow as you go through the first and second quarter going forward to answer your question i think that on a netnet basis second quarter will probably be kind of flattish in terms of earning asset growth but i think in the back half of the year well see a little bit in the way of an upward movement in our earning asset base as we strive to fund our loan growth through methods other than just relying on cash flow from the bond portfolio peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division okay so i mean is it dependent on deposit growth being positive or would you borrow money to fund loan growth and just utilize capital that way michael m achary really the answer is all those things peyton those are all things that we have done are considering doing and potentially will do going forward operator im not showing any further questions at this time id like to turn the call back over to carl chaney for closing remarks carl j chaney okay thank you and i want to thank everyone for joining us today on this call were very very proud of our associates and all the

ceo mike achary cfo sam kendricks chief credit officer steve barker chief accounting officer and trisha carlson investor relations manager as a reminder this call is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to trisha carlson you may begin trisha voltz carlson thank you and good morning during todays call we may make forwardlooking statements we would like to remind everyone to review the safe harbor language that was published with yesterdays release and presentation and in the companys most recent k and q hancocks ability to accurately project results or predict the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently limited we believe that the expectations reflected or implied by any forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements hancock undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements the presentation slides included in our k are also posted with the conference call webcast link on the investor relations website we will reference some of these slides in todays call i will now turn the call over to carl chaney president and ceo carl j chaney good morning thank you for joining us today yesterday we reported second quarter earnings in line with the streets expectations of  million or  per diluted share highlights on the quarter included approximately  million linked quarter net loan growth or  annualized and  million or  yearoveryear loan growth excluding the fdiccovered portfolio loan growth was solid across the companys footprint with all markets contributing to the overall growth in the quarter the quarters solid performance reflected an improvement in our core results a trend we expect to build on in the future as we noted in the past our core results  or our reported results led the impact of net purchase accounting adjustments our reported core revenue improved for the quarter with core net interest income and net interest margin relatively stable and growth in our fee income lines of business our results reflected continued improvement in overall asset quality metrics and we initiated a  common stock repurchase in may in conjunction with the expense and efficiency initiative we announced with last quarters results we also previously announced the expected closure of approximately  branches across our footprint earlier this week we announced that we have signed agreements to sell  of those  retail locations along with the loans and deposits in those branches  of the branches are in alexandria or central louisiana and  are small regional branches in houston these transactions continue our local commitment to the communities by keeping both jobs and business opportunities in these markets at this time ill turn the call over to our cfo mike achary who will review some of the quarters results in more detail michael m achary thanks carl and good morning everyone as carl noted net income for the second quarter was  million or  per diluted common share that was down slightly from  million or  last quarter the biggest driver of the decline in earnings on a linkedquarter basis is related to accretion in the first quarter we had  million pretax or about  per share of excess cash recoveries in our accretion numbers for the second quarter we had  million pretax or  per share of similar accretion levels thats about a  million negative impact to reported net interest income and a good example of the volatility inherent in our numbers which we talked a lot about over the last few quarters as carl mentioned we did have success in growing the companys net loan portfolio during the quarter total loans at june  were  billion up almost  million from march  we backed out the fdiccovered loan portfolio which did decline  million during the quarter total loans increased  million or about  linked quarter but  annualized the largest component of net loan growth during the quarter was in the ci portfolio with a small increase in residential mortgage loans net interest income for the second quarter was  million down almost  million linked quarter average earning asset levels were virtually unchanged as mentioned  million of the decline was related to a lower level of purchase accountingrelated accretion mainly related to the volatility from excess cash recoveries in the slide presentation on our website weve added detailed information on the purchase accounting items in our quarterly results the schedule on slide  details accretion on both the whitney and peoples first acquired portfolios the excess cash recoveries in each quarter and then finally the premium on the bond amortization related to the whitney bond portfolio this will help reconcile reported and core results and hopefully help everyone understand the dynamics in these numbers the net interest margin was  for the second quarter down  basis points from  in the first quarter the core margin of  was relatively stable during the quarter and compressed only  basis points while core net interest income was down slightly we hope that with the initiatives currently in place on loan volume pricing and mix we will see a tradeoff of margin for core net interest income in the near term this will help position us well for an eventual rise in interest rates helping drive the improvement in core revenue was the additional  million of fee income generated in the quarter the increase reflects some seasonality in lines of business such as trust and insurance but also includes healthy levels of new business additionally higher stock market values did help some feegenerating lines we talked a lot about expenses last quarter and the companys efficiency initiatives we are very focused on this initiative and have a clear line of sight to deliver the first  million in expense reductions by the first quarter of  in coming quarters we will begin to discuss additional specifics of the overall plan meanwhile noninterest expense for the second quarter was up  million or about  from last quarter the driver of that increase was mainly related to a  million increase in ore expense to a total of  million in the second quarter this expense category can be somewhat volatile from period to period and we expect to operate in a range somewhere between the first and second quarter levels in the near term at the gulf south bank conference in may we announced plans to close about  branch locations across our state footprint as part of the expense reduction initiative earlier this week as carl noted we reached agreements to sell  of those retail branch locations a significant portion of the cost savings targeted for the first quarter of  will be derived from these closures and resulting sales we plan to close a majority of the branches on or about august  of  with the remaining branches scheduled to close or be sold by year end we expect the onetime cost associated with the branch closures and sales to be booked in the third quarter these costs are expected to be lower than the previous guidance of between  million and  million the branch sales will be reflected in our fourth quarter results and finally before i turn the call over to sam i would like to quickly remind everyone of the asr transaction carl mentioned earlier the asr or accelerated share repurchase was initiated on may  with morgan stanley we received  million shares or  of the amount projected to be repurchased based on the company stock prices at that time as of today we expect to receive about  million additional shares associated with this transaction we will receive these shares no earlier than november and no later than next may at that point well be able to determine the average repurchase price i will now turn the call over to sam kendricks our chief credit officer samuel b kendricks thank you mike as carl mentioned earlier were seeing continued improvement in our asset quality metrics nonperforming assets totaled  million at june  thats down  million from march  the nonperforming asset ratio was  basis points at june  compared to  basis points last quarter the decrease in overall npas reflects our continued success in selling ore properties during the quarter with our net reduction of  million the reduction in nonperforming loans of  million was mainly related to payoffs and paydowns in the npl categories the level of ore may be volatile in the near term as problem credits from the peoples first covered portfolio work their way to the foreclosure process additionally we have seen increase as the branchs closing connection with the efficiency initiative move into surplus back property net chargeoffs from the noncovered loan portfolio were  million thats  basis points of average loans in this quarter thats up slightly from  million or  basis points in the first quarter during the second quarter we recorded total provision for loan losses of  million thats down from  million in the first quarter the provision for noncovered loans was  million and that compares to  million in the first quarter of  the increase was mainly related to the increased volume of new loans originated during the second quarter now during the second quarter the net provision from the covered portfolio was  and that compares to  million in the first quarter as a reminder the first quarter provision for covered loans included approximately  million of impairment related to changes in the estimated timing of cash flows which does not have an offsetting impact on the loss share receivable the allowance for loan losses was  million at the end of the second quarter and thats virtually unchanged from march  the ratio of the allowance to periodend loans was  basis points down slightly from  basis points at march  the allowance maintained on the originated portion of the portfolio totaled  million or  basis points of related loans at june  up from  million or  basis points at the end of the first quarter finally as noted on slide  we have seen a reduction of over  million in criticized loans excluding the fdiccovered portfolio over the past  years our staff has worked very hard to either move these credits off the balance sheet or rehab and upgrade them to performing credits and we will continue our efforts to work through the problem credits that remain in our portfolio today i will now turn the call back over to carl carl j chaney thanks sam as you can see we had a very solid quarter and our underlying trends and fundamentals are positive such as loan growth in the high singledigit annualized level improved asset quality improvements in fee generation goals were in place for expense cuts and for becoming a more efficient organization strategic deployment of excess capital through the current buyback program and continuing to build on that strong capital to allow us to take advantage of future strategic opportunities including additional buybacks organic growth dividends or acquisitions we are better positioned to succeed in todays economic environment and thrive when theres an eventual sustain positive turn in the overall economy we will now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from michael rose from raymond james michael rose  raymond james  associates inc research division just wanted to get your thoughts outside of the share repurchase program what you would view as the order of priority or magnitude for capital deployment opportunities carl j chaney well outside of the buyback of course we want to make sure we maintain sufficient capital for the growth in our earning assets that we see coming in the future quarters as we did this quarter and then of course we think therell be some strategic opportunities for acquisitions as well and then were always looking at our dividend payout ratio and when those  when changes are warranted in the payout then well certainly entertain those as well michael m achary and carl certainly once this repurchase is complete the door is certainly open to considering an additional repurchase hope that makes sense michael rose  raymond james  associates inc research division okay thats helpful and then just secondarily on the  once you achieve the cost savings i mean where are you taking those savings in redeploying those savings into revenue production are you trying to hire more teams in select markets are you trying to build out certain lines of business any color there would be helpful michael m achary yes michael this is mike certainly those are things that well be doing as we go through this initiative that is redeploying those resources into certainly revenuebased lines as well as other investments throughout the companys footprint this is about making the company more efficient but its also about improving our opportunities to generate revenue operator our next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons from sandler oneill kevin fitzsimmons  sandler oneill  partners lp research division the loan growth in ci seem like it was definitely a strength this quarter and i was wondering if you could just dig in a little further to that with what markets you were seeing strength and whether you think that kind of growth is something that would continue or was there something unusual about this quarter that caused it to jump carl j chaney kevin the loan growth was actually spread across the footprint which is a good thing from my perspective and as far as being able to look out we dont think  it certainly wasnt tied to any unusual activity that took place during the quarter when we look at the pipeline we see a very strong pipeline and so we feel very confident in our ability to continue to post strong loan growth for the foreseeable future and the quarters coming michael m achary yes kevin this is mike and just to reiterate carls point the growth was pretty sustained across the footprint i think thats one of the big positives if we look at again where that growth came from probably was a little bit more weighted towards the west side of the franchise that would be southeast louisiana of course into texas but were very pleased with the growth that we experienced also in florida alabama and even decent production levels in mississippi so it was a pretty broad base kevin fitzsimmons  sandler oneill  partners lp research division okay great thats helpful and maybe if you guys could just touch on i think you alluded to it in your comments but just generally how youd characterize your impact to rising rates both what weve seen recently with the rise of shortterm rate  or longterm rates rather but then longer term when we see a pickup in shortterm rates michael m achary sure absolutely and again as you know were asset sensitive in a pretty significant way so rising rates will certainly benefit our company going forward especially when you consider the positive mix that we have the high level of noninterestbearing deposits which are not worth a whole lot right now in this environment to take on obviously added value as rates begin to rise so thats something that obviously were looking forward to kevin fitzsimmons  sandler oneill  partners lp research division how about just with  in the near term with what has happened with the tenure any  does it at least alleviate a little bit the reinvestment situation that we have before couple quarters ago michael m achary yes it certainly helps anytime the yield curve steepens thats a good thing and good thing for banking and thats something we believe well be able to take advantage of assuming that continues into the future on a very shortterm basis it hasnt had a whole lot of impact yet but we believe thats yet to come operator our next question comes from matthew clark from crédit suisse matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division just as a followup to that last question i think new production you guys are putting on an average  to  i think your core yield is  any  doesnt sound like theres much of a change there on pricing or has there been michael m achary a little bit of a change yes we talked about last quarter the new production came on at about  this quarter it was probably in the  to  range so that compressed a little bit and again that was due more than anything else to the weighting of the way the growth came on the balance sheet that is mostly in the ci portfolio and again going forward like weve talked about so many times we have initiatives in place that will hopefully help us deliver a little bit fuller mix of loans going forward and by that we mean more investor real estate and other forms of real estate that will give us a little bit fuller yield matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division okay and then what portion of the ci came from smix ph  the growth there carl j chaney we had an increase in smix ph of about  million or so from last quarter matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division and then lastly with the branch sales i guess a part question you have  locked up ready to go and it sounds like you had  million  million loans and deposits going with that any sense though be it the  how much  im just trying to get the sense for what you need to overcome to still grow here with what might be sold in the other  michael m achary well at this point matt we have no impending announcements related to the other  and theres nothing that were at this point in time working on but were still going through the marketing effort and still certainly is possible that we can have some success in selling some of the other branches that are scheduled for closure matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division okay and then just  with this  you finetuning the business model and the strategy and approach in each of your markets can you give us a sense as you finetune commercial versus retail of both how thats going so far and maybe what underlying attrition youre assuming carl j chaney yes id say weve had actually great success in redeploying one of our earlier questions about how are we going to redeploy these expense savings and it really comes down to fine tuning these markets particularly those markets where we dont have a significant market share at the time but theyre large markets that are growing houston is a perfect example tampas a good example jacksonville is a good example where we have a reasonable presence but not an enormous market share like we do in the orleans our south louisiana baton rouge or the gulf coast but those markets will have a small market share it allows us to really redeploy the expense base that previously was attributable to the retail branch network that we inherited or acquired and redeploy that into a very specific commercialfocused effort which obviously we have been very successful in the past and yet as you can see in this quarter and we feel very comfortable with the pipeline being able to continue to generate that strong ci growth operator our next question comes from emlen harmon from jefferies emlen b harmon  jefferies llc research division the core margin down  basis points quarteroverquarter below your kind of guided decline of  to  basis points can you give us a sense of just kind of maybe where thats  with the underlying trends that are helping that out are  and do you feel like if loan growth continues at this current pace and with the rise in rates should you be in the lower end of that compression guidance over the next few quarters here michael m achary its mike related to the quarter obviously we were helped out by the change in earning asset mix to deployment of the excess liquidity that we effected toward the end of last quarter we were also able to push our cost to funds down  basis points and then finally the loan growth certainly was a big help although i will point out that the vast majority of that loan growth did occur really in the second half of the quarter so well see a little bit fuller impact on the margin this quarter related to that quarters late loan growth and then certainly going forward we believe that well be able to continue to show these kinds of levels of loan growth so with that all said the guidance that we gave last quarter around  to  basis points of being compression on a near term basis really still kind of holds true we were down  basis points this quarter and we still have obviously some downward pressure on our nim once we get to the sustained levels of loan growth and have a fuller mix of loan growth we think those pressures will lessen that makes sense emlen b harmon  jefferies llc research division that does make sense thats helpful and then the excess cash recovery in the quarter you guys have given us some pretty good guidance on when you expect some purchase accretion and kind    how much excess cash recovery is assumed in those estimates that you did laid out in the slide deck michael m achary really none and again that speaks to the volatility of that particular line item and really how unpredictable it is and so with that means is to the extent that we can get a good deal with these excess cash recoveries then those bars on slide  will move to the left in terms of the accretion carl j chaney and also reflects our conservative approach to this it is very difficult to forecast that so we just assume  but when you look at previous quarters and look at the amount thats come in its been significant at times so but because there is absolutely no way to be able to forecast that we take a conservative approachtype of forecasting and assume  we know thats not realistic but theres no way to be any type of specificity around that forecasted amount emlen b harmon  jefferies llc research division got it and then just last one for me on the expense stage you guys are obviously maintaining your efficiency plan guidance for by the time we get to  but its seems like some of those stage maybe a little slower and developing in  could you just give us kind of the background there michael m achary yes i think as we said in the call a little bit earlier we have a pretty defined pathway to get to the achievement of those goals there really wasnt any expectation that we would show a lot of progress this past quarter i think youll see some progress in the coming quarter and certainly more by the time we get to the fourth quarter again as we affect these branch closures and then our guidance and were reemphasizing this this morning is that well hit those targets for the first quarter of  carl j chaney yes the branch closures are expected to occur by august  so we feel very confident in our ability to just to hit our goals that weve laid out operator our next question comes from peyton green from sterne agee peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division carl mike i was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the loan pipeline as to the volume and maybe how it compared them to year end and to a quarter ago and then also maybe what the mix look like have you seen any initial signs of mix change that might be more encouraging for broadening out of the mix samuel b kendricks this is sam were very encouraged by the pipeline were seeing  as opposed to some quarters where there might be a concentration relative to the components of growth were seeing a more broadbased opportunities there so  and were obviously encouraged by the fact that throughout the enterprise east to west that were seeing growth opportunities so i would characterize this as more broadbased than concentrated we have some opportunities in ci and cre you will have noticed that over the last  to  quarters we have continued to manage down our cre concentrations but we have  we think managed down and the categories that we wanted to manage down and then we have some opportunity for growth so we think we would likely see some growth in some of the cre categories particularly in commitments that are already made on the books as those findings come online so we think its going to be pretty broadbased and were pretty encouraged by the pipeline momentum we have peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division okay and the volume lines i mean what kind of order magnitude carl j chaney i think what we saw this quarter this past quarter is reasonable we dont see any significant drop offs from those levels at all when we look peyton at the pipeline its pretty strong and so as i mentioned  as i responded to an earlier question there really was nothing unusual that was driving the strong loan growth this quarter we expect that to continue that trend peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division so if you got that kind of volume in the third quarter mike i mean whats the willingness to let earning assets actually grow dollar for dollar is it still  theres  i guess maybe where would you like the securities portfolio to be in a perfect world how much smaller from the current level michael m achary well in a perfect world i mean were very comfortable with letting the level that bond portfolio continue to truck down and let that be the primary source for funding loan growth so i think on a very shortterm basis i think what youll see is probably more of the same in terms of balance sheet management you could see not much of an increase in average earning assets but again hopefully a pretty significant change in that mix more loans plus bonds peyton n green  sterne agee  leach inc research division okay great so then with regard to the branch closures and the process improvement thats going on how much of the branches  i mean how much  closing  branches i mean is it a pro rata move on occupancy or are these lower cost branches or higher cost i mean what in terms of going through the line items as we recognize these things is there any disproportionate weight to personnel versus occupancy versus other michael m achary no not really i mean as far as the impact on our income statement related to closing the facilities it will go a long way to helping us achieve that first set of goals so without doing the math there you can see that it has a significant impact i wouldnt say that the branches that were closing necessarily the ones at the higher cost although that probably is in the case in some selected branches its more of what we talked about last quarter and that is desire to be efficient as possible in terms of delivering our product and services to customers and doing that in a manner that make sense for the company operator our next question comes from christopher marinac from fig partners christopher w marinac  fig partners llc research division mike and carl if we look at the disclosures on last several quarters on originated loans versus the acquired loans and kind of add those  together and compare with where you were  years ago like just right after the closing on a merger looks like youre ahead maybe   from the time you close is that a fair way of kind of judging if we step back and kind of look at integration of the  banks  years later is that something we should continue to expand as time passes michael m achary well again when you look at those various columns the acquired loan portfolio is going to go down simply because of maturities loans moving off the balance sheet and other things that are going on so i dont know thats a perfect way of looking at or judging the integration i think the integration success really is better judged on the things that were doing now to grow our balance sheet and grow our customer base and again with the loan growth that we achieved this quarter and the prospects of the future i think that certainly the results are evident christopher w marinac  fig partners llc research division okay very well then i guess just as a separate followup is if you were to find an acquisition do the efficiency improvements that youre doing do they impact the back office or that sort of any integration of an acquisition even if its small sort of be separate from the efficiency movements beyond the branch sales michael m achary yes i think the things that weve done the things that we will do as we go to the rest of this exercise put us in the position to be that much more efficient from a back office point of view such that if we are able to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities those efficiencies will already be in place carl j chaney yes this is carl the efficiency initiatives they certainly wont have any negative impact in our ability to be able to do future acquisitions and fold those in in fact it actually will allow us to be even more efficient in the assimilation and integration of any future acquisition operator our next question comes from jennifer demba from suntrust robinson jennifer h demba  suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division just a question on the texas branches youre selling just curious how many branches that leaves you within texas i know its more of the commercial banking focus there but just curious what that leaves you with in terms of a small retail presence if any michael m achary yes we had a total of  jennifer in texas we have slated  of those  for closure and of course were selling  of the  carl j chaney and those were variable the  that were selling are very small retail focus branches that allows us to reposition the remaining indiscernible and even look at growth of additional facilities that are very much specifically focused on commercial opportunities as opposed to overall retail and what we compare to michael m achary yes but let me correct that number we had a total of  in houston not  jennifer h demba  suntrust robinson humphrey inc research division okay and another question on the energy portfolio just curious as to what the size of that is now and what you feel like the potential is for growth there samuel b kendricks jennifer this is sam our energy portfolio at the  for second quarter is just over  billion when we say energy thats across several segments of the energy spectrum not just reservedbased lending but it also includes support industries that are very important to that segment of the economy and that includes industry and businesses throughout south louisiana and into texas as well and i think thats on slide  of the deck as well as the presentation on that in terms of potential they are continuing potential opportunities there the oil and gas industry continues to show some strength and so we obviously want to continue to participate in that important segment of the economy for this part of the country but it is not a singular source of loan growth in our portfolio strategically it is part of the balance that we will be seeking but we do see additional opportunities in this segment operator our next question comes from matthew clark from crédit suisse matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division just a couple of followups on the crosses ph could you guys quantify how much you extracted this quarter i know it wasnt a lot but just curious with what the number was michael m achary no we did not matt we do not quantify that number matthew t clark  crédit suisse ag research division okay and then on ma i think in the past you guys have expressed interest in wanting a larger presence in houston and i think tampa to jacksonville are you guys willing to consider opportunities outside of those markets on the ma front michael m achary well if you look at the  its  states that we operate in those are very attractive markets for us we will certainly look at opportunities within those  states when you look at some of the markets in which we have a presence in there are some real opportunities for future growth and these markets that im referring to have great growth prospects economically and so i think theres plenty of room in our existing footprint by state for us to have some significant growth opportunities through acquisition when the right deals present themselves operator our next question comes from matt olney from stephens matt olney  stephens inc research division wanted to go back on the core net interest income kind of x at paa that you highlighted on slide  it was down sequentially again in the second quarter but the level of decrease seems to be slowing down quite a bit i think it was just down  this quarter is it fair to say that core nii could hit the inflection point in q or could we be still be a few quarters from that inflection point michael m achary yes matt i would tell you that the inflection point is maybe a quarter or  away for the reasons we kind of talked about a little bit earlier a lot of the loan growth we experienced this quarter again was backended and i allow the core of margin improvement but certainly related to our ability to deploy some of those excess liquidity that we had from early in the year so the momentum related to continuing loan growth and then getting a fuller mix of loan growth will be the things that will really help us with our inflection operator that concludes the qa portion of our call and i would like to turn the conference back to mr carl chaney for closing remarks carl j chaney okay thank you again for joining us as you see were pleased at the very strong quarter that we were able to post in im very confident about that next couple of quarters as far as what we see in our pipelines so again we thank you for
