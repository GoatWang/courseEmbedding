linda breathitt and curt hébert jr in this order the commission dismisses as moot a request for rehearing in light of subsequent and superseding congressional action of a letter order issued in this proceeding on august   that concluded that james r lientz jr could only conditionally hold interlocking positions as director of georgia power company georgia power and president and director of nationsbank of georgia na nationsbank georgia in addition the commission directs other individuals who have been granted authorization to hold an interlock and who believe they are affected by the above congressional action to provide notice to us background on january   mr lientz filed an application pursuant to section b of the federal power act fpa  for commission authorization to hold interlocking positions as director of georgia power and president and director of nationsbank georgia as explained in the august  order georgia power is a public utility for the purpose of section b while neither nationsbank georgia nor its parent may directly underwrite or participate in the marketing of the securities of a public utility two affiliates of nationsbank georgia may underwrite or participate in the marketing of the securities of public utilities the commission has found that these securities underwriting and marketing authorizations are attributed to nationsbank georgia and as a consequence the proposed interlocking positions were found to be jurisdictional pursuant to section b in the august  letter order the director division of opinions and corporate applications office of electric power regulation pursuant to delegated authority explained the commission has observed that a senior executive or corporate officer has the ability to substantially influence company policies in such a manner as to jeopardize the best interests of the utility its investors and the consuming public accordingly the commission has held that this type of interlock requires the imposition of certain safeguards to prevent “opportunities for undue influence failures in arms length bargaining or other potential improprieties” after consideration it is concluded that the conditioned holding of the positions identified will not adversely affect public or private interests authorization to hold them is hereby granted subject to the condition that nationsbank georgia and its subsidiaries and affiliates refrain from underwriting or participating in the marketing of securities other than dealing in the secondary securities market of georgia power and its subsidiaries and affiliates during the period mr lientz holds any of the authorized interlocking positions on rehearing mr lientz requests that the commission no longer impose the underwriting ban as a condition of his interlock authorization mr lientz asserts that the underwriting ban “is no longer justified or necessary to protect the public interest”  and that changed circumstances warrant the commission start printed page ceasing to impose the underwriting ban as a condition of approving the type of interlock at issue in this proceeding mr lientz also requests that in lieu of the underwriting ban the commission consider the use of two alternative and less onerous conditions when approving an interlock between a public utility and an underwriting firm specifically that i the applicant would refrain from participating directly or indirectly as director or officer of the public utility or the affected underwriting firm or such underwriting firms parent in any decisions regarding the financing of the public utility or its affiliates by such underwriting firm or ii the applicant would prove to the satisfaction of a majority of the disinterested directors of the public utility and the affected underwriting firm respectively that the proposed transactionss between the public utility and the underwriting firm are fair and reasonable to the utilitys shareholders and ratepayers such proof to be evidenced by a vote of the disinterested directors of the public utility and the affected underwriting firm on september   georgia power filed an untimely motion to intervene and a brief in support of mr lientzs request for rehearing on april   first union corporation first union filed an untimely motion to intervene and an amicus brief in support of granting rehearing to reconsider whether the commissions current policy on interlocks between banks and public utilities should be continued subsequent and superseding congressional action on november   the president signed into law the grammleachbliley financial modernization act financial modernization act among other things this legislation amends section b to include four conditions and if any one of these were met they would remove from our jurisdiction a person seeking to hold an interlocking directorate on november   first union filed a motion to lodge the financial modernization act discussion pursuant to rule d of the commissions rules of practice and procedure we will grant the untimely motions to intervene of georgia power and first union given the unique circumstances present here their interest in the outcome of this proceeding and the absence of any prejudice or delay we will dismiss as moot the request for rehearing as noted above subsequent to the august  letter order and mr lientzs request for rehearing congress amended section b section bb now provides in relevant part that the section b ban on holding interlocking directorates absent commission authorization does not apply if the person holding the interlock i does not participate in any deliberations or decisions of the public utility regarding the selection of a bank trust company banking association or firm to underwrite or participate in the marketing of securities of the public utility if the person serves as an officer or director of a bank trust company banking association or firm that is under consideration in the deliberation process ii the bank trust company banking association or firm of which the person is an officer or director does not engage in the underwriting of or participate in the marketing of securities of the public utility of which the person holds the position of officer or director iii the public utility for which the person serves or proposes to serve as an officer or director selects underwriters by competitive procedures or iv the issuance of securities of the public utility for which the person serves or proposes to serve as an officer or director has been approved by all federal and state regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the issuance thus in amending section b congress has eliminated in certain circumstances the need for the holder of the interlocks to obtain commission authorization for such interlocks these circumstances include as relevant here where the underwriting firm involved in an interlock is under consideration to underwrite the securities of the public utility involved in the interlock and where persons who would hold the interlocks do not themselves participate in the public utilitys selection of the underwriting firm as noted above in his request for rehearing mr lientz proposed that as a condition for commission approval of an interlock “the applicant would refrain from participating directly or indirectly as director or officer of the public utility or the affected underwriting firm or such underwriting firms parent in any decisions affecting the financing of the public utility or its affiliates by such underwriting firm”  we interpret mr lientz proposed condition as effectively agreeing to the first condition of section bb and we direct mr lientz to notify the commission within  days if he believes that further commission action is required in light of the new legislation pertaining to section bbi and our understanding that mr lientz meets at least one of the conditions of section bb he no longer needs commission authorization to hold the interlocking directorate thus we will dismiss as moot mr lientzs request for rehearing we also take this opportunity to state that if there are other individuals who have been granted authorization to hold interlocking directorates but believe that they now do not need such commission authorization because of section bb they should notify the commission of this within  days of the date of publication in the federal register pursuant to section b of the commissions regulations the commission orders a georgia powers and first unions untimely motions to intervene are hereby granted b mr lientzs request for rehearing of the august  order is hereby dismissed as moot as discussed in the body of this order c any individual who has been granted authorization to hold an interlock who believes he is affected by the financial modernization act is hereby directed to so notify the commission within thirty  days of the date of publication of this order in the federal register as discussed in the body of this order d the secretary is hereby directed to publish this order in the federal register start signature by the commission david p boergers
