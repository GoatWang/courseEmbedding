marketing automation sales and crm solutions by vertical agencies bloggers ecommerce saas by team customer success marketing sales pricing enterprise contact log in try it free how real estate companies can use automated lead scoring to get more appointments and interested buyers in this use case youll learn how to reactivate an old list and identify those contacts who are still interested identify and tag your contacts exact interests so that you can send them targeted followup automate your sales process for maximum efficiency tags crm marketing automation real estate small business use case many real estate companies collect email addresses on their web site and within advertisements people looking for a new place to live visit their property listings and submit forms to receive more information such as whether a location is available facilities nearby price etc they also usually collect leads through real estate tradeshows potential buyers coming to their offices etc but the vast majority of contacts come from the webforms that exist in each of their listings when they ask a question about a property a real estate company invites them to optinto their newsletter list so they can be updated with news offers price changes etc a savvy real estate company can quickly generate a substantial list of leads and want to begin leveraging their list to generate more business many teams use traditional email marketing campaigns but marketing automation open up new possibilities and have many advantages over autoresponders and traditional email marketing services such as mailchimp and aweber  the context a real estate company who is new to marketing automation should create welldefined goals you’d probably like to “reactivate” old contacts to see if they’d like to search a new house some contacts are actively looking for a new apartment at one time but you might not of heard back from them you need to find out ‘are they still interested have they found a new house’ once the contacts are reactivated you can build your relationship with them and help them find a property if they are still looking you can leverage the crm component of activecampaign to better manage your best leads and deals and automated email marketing to get back to less interested people so that you can focus on your best opportunities and use automation to turn lukewarm prospects into solid deals  the campaign and some of the activecampaign features used activating people who is still interested if your list is older you need to start with figuring out who is still interested you can easily create a onetime campaign for this using the rss feed from your site you can prepare this in less than  mins categorizing people who is interested in what using activecampaign’s site tracking feature you can see which contacts visit which listings   you can create an automation to apply a tag that can identifies who is interested in not only what kind of property but also what area by doing this for all the areas you cover you can create profile of exactly what potential buyer is interested in sending targeted campaigns decide how you define interests and then followup on those interests you might choose something like if a contact has visited at least  or  listing of the same area automation with send specific listings about that area if a contact visited a property individual page more than  times create deal and manual follow up if someone has visited a certain listing  or  times they are probably really interested in it and they may want to make an appointment  to visit the property for this purpose you could create an automation if a contact visited a page more than  times create a deal and manually follow up the reason to create a deal because that’s going to allow them to contact that potential buyer in a more individual way by contacting him through their gmail account those emails can be tracked within activecampaign if a contact does not reply to the email invitation where the real estate company tries to book an appointment for a visit try with another channel of communication like a phone call or sms if the contact comes back to the site after doing a manual followup move him automatically into another stage of the deal try to get an appointment setting up an sms is as easy as including an email in an automation it implies an additional cost per sms but its return on investment can be really high usually the sales team distributes the work without assigning a sales person specifically to a deal for this reason having a crm where everyone can access to the status of every deal is essential your whole team can have their personal email accounts synced with the tool so it’s pretty easy to handle any deal no matter if they have previously worked on it or if it has been one of your colleagues if there is a person on your team who especially good at closing deals he could handle that particular aspect you can automatically create tasks for him when the deal moves to that stage of your pipeline get better results from your marketing try activecampaign free for days no credit card needed sign up free

 case studies features email marketing marketing automation sales and crm solutions by vertical agencies bloggers ecommerce saas by team customer success marketing sales pricing enterprise contact log in try it free how real estate companies can use automated lead scoring to get more appointments and interested buyers in this use case youll learn how to reactivate an old list and identify those contacts who are still interested identify and tag your contacts exact interests so that you can send them targeted followup automate your sales process for maximum efficiency tags crm marketing automation real estate small business use case many real estate companies collect email addresses on their web site and within advertisements people looking for a new place to live visit their property listings and submit forms to receive more information such as whether a location is available facilities nearby price etc they also usually collect leads through real estate tradeshows potential buyers coming to their offices etc but the vast majority of contacts come from the webforms that exist in each of their listings when they ask a question about a property a real estate company invites them to optinto their newsletter list so they can be updated with news offers price changes etc a savvy real estate company can quickly generate a substantial list of leads and want to begin leveraging their list to generate more business many teams use traditional email marketing campaigns but marketing automation open up new possibilities and have many advantages over autoresponders and traditional email marketing services such as mailchimp and aweber  the context a real estate company who is new to marketing automation should create welldefined goals you’d probably like to “reactivate” old contacts to see if they’d like to search a new house some contacts are actively looking for a new apartment at one time but you might not of heard back from them you need to find out ‘are they still interested have they found a new house’ once the contacts are reactivated you can build your relationship with them and help them find a property if they are still looking you can leverage the crm component of activecampaign to better manage your best leads and deals and automated email marketing to get back to less interested people so that you can focus on your best opportunities and use automation to turn lukewarm prospects into solid deals  the campaign and some of the activecampaign features used activating people who is still interested if your list is older you need to start with figuring out who is still interested you can easily create a onetime campaign for this using the rss feed from your site you can prepare this in less than  mins categorizing people who is interested in what using activecampaign’s site tracking feature you can see which contacts visit which listings   you can create an automation to apply a tag that can identifies who is interested in not only what kind of property but also what area by doing this for all the areas you cover you can create profile of exactly what potential buyer is interested in sending targeted campaigns decide how you define interests and then followup on those interests you might choose something like if a contact has visited at least  or  listing of the same area automation with send specific listings about that area if a contact visited a property individual page more than  times create deal and manual follow up if someone has visited a certain listing  or  times they are probably really interested in it and they may want to make an appointment  to visit the property for this purpose you could create an automation if a contact visited a page more than  times create a deal and manually follow up the reason to create a deal because that’s going to allow them to contact that potential buyer in a more individual way by contacting him through their gmail account those emails can be tracked within activecampaign if a contact does not reply to the email invitation where the real estate company tries to book an appointment for a visit try with another channel of communication like a phone call or sms if the contact comes back to the site after doing a manual followup move him automatically into another stage of the deal try to get an appointment setting up an sms is as easy as including an email in an automation it implies an additional cost per sms but its return on investment can be really high usually the sales team distributes the work without assigning a sales person specifically to a deal for this reason having a crm where everyone can access to the status of every deal is essential your whole team can have their personal email accounts synced with the tool so it’s pretty easy to handle any deal no matter if they have previously worked on it or if it has been one of your colleagues if there is a person on your team who especially good at closing deals he could handle that particular aspect you can automatically create tasks for him when the deal moves to that stage of your pipeline get better results from your
