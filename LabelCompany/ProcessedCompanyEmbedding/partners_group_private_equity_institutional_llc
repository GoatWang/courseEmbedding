not its approach cofounder alfred gantner and new chairman peter wuffli aim to pursue global growth but vow to stick with partners groups diversified strategy by aaron timms partners groups alfred gantner left and peter wuffli photograph by christian grund page  of  its retractable roof and swooping flying saucerlike shell design marlins park is difficult to miss on the highway leading downtown from miamis airport the seat stadium home of the miami marlins baseball team doesnt automatically suggest itself as a suitable venue for an elite private equity meeting but when partners group a swiss private investment firm decided to hold its annual investor conference in the us for the first time in march it booked the gaudy stadium for the openingnight dinner founded in  by three former goldman sachs group bankers partners has expanded briskly over the past half decade doubling its assets under management to almost  billion and nearly tripling its staff from  to  with the oncereclusive company looking to project itself onto the global stage and woo a larger category of institutional investors the arenastyle comingout party represented a confident declaration of intent the firm is at its next juncture says alfred gantner one of the three cofounders partners new growth strategy goes hand in hand with an effort to institutionalize the leadership of the firm beyond its founders ­­ a rarity in the private equity industry where most of the big shops are still stamped with the oftenforceful personalities of their creators the cofounders will continue to be active in investment decisions but as gantner puts it they want the future of the firm to be less about them and more about partners itself the firm is more diverse its more international there are more stakeholders so it makes sense for us to do the things that were doing now to take the firm to the next level he says partners is calling on some big names to boost its international profile  and face up to the challenges that greater size creates chairman peter wuffli former ceo of ubs is one of those names tapped to succeed gantner who continues to chair the firms global investment committee the slight bespectacled wuffli took to the lectern at the dinner in march and introduced himself to roughly  investors seated at tables arranged around the stadium infield often coping with success is tougher than coping with failure he said explaining his determination to focus on risk management when youre very successful everybody applauds you and you actually start to believe it you get a creeping complacency an arrogance wufflis words echoing through the open roof into the salty miami night air carried a special resonance the evening was not just a showcase for partners it marked wufflis return to the spotlight after seven years in the comparative wilderness wuffli served for four years as chief executive of ubs before being pushed out in  as the banks losses from its involvement in the us subprime debacle which eventually topped  billion began to emerge hes kept a low profile in the years since then overseeing the elea foundation for ethics in globalization a zurichbased philanthropic organization he founded with his wife susanna and sitting on the boards of lausannebased business school imd and the zurich opera house he also penned a book on legal ethics published in german under the title liberale ethik partners rose out of the flowering of european private equity in the late s but it took a path distinct from the likes of apax partners and cvc capital partners most investors in germanspeaking central europe the firms first providers of capital were unfamiliar with usstyle private equity so the group chose a diversified strategy that relied largely on participating in other firms deals via primary investments through a fund of funds or buying existing private equity holdings on the secondary market it also focused on small to midcap deals that larger houses tended to pass over this has given the firm its unique integrated approach which allows partners the flexibility to cycle in and out of different instruments  direct investments primaries or secondaries  depending on where it sees the best longterm relative value you always have the right instrument to hand explains urs wietlisbach one of the cofounders who oversees client relations as chairman of the markets committee lately the group has been putting more emphasis on direct investments they accounted for just over a third of the firms allocations last year on a par with secondary investments and the plan is to raise that share to  percent according to wietlisbach partners is looking to broaden its clientele beyond its traditional base of institutions in germanspeaking europe the uk and scandinavia it has made some inroads recently asia and latin america account for  percent of the firms investors by assets up from just  percent in  over the same period north america has grown to  percent from  percent successfully executing the firms growth strategy will require better contacts at a much higher level in the institutional investor world to that end partners has recruited three highprofile individuals to its board in addition to wuffli they are charles dallara former head of the institute of international finance who serves as chairman of the americas and patrick ward a former managing director at goldman sachs who was one of that firms leading partners at the time of its  ipo he is chairman of the uk and the middle east these hires represent a serious statement of intent for a firm that has until now kept a fairly low international profile operating from its headquarters in the tiny swiss canton of zug a lowtax haven thats home to numerous hedge funds and commodities giant glencore xstrata the firm had been run by a compact board of six people  all swiss  on which its three cofounders exerted an outsize influence this firms had remarkable success but its been built from the ground up dallara says these guys have never had to build extremely senior relationships with the leaders of banks insurance firms and sovereign wealth funds china japan and the middle east are all areas where partners has in dallaras view significant catchup work to do to ensure it is being heard at the top table of investors especially by those in the sovereign wealth fund world wuffli might appear an odd choice as the man to guide partners to its next stage of development he has no real private equity background to speak of his main experience of daytoday operations at ubs was as head of the asset management group and in other respects he is a controversial figure a  businessweek story described the former mckinsey  co consultant as the master of zurich a figure of generational significance who had brought the glory days back to swiss banking in  after wuffli had resigned from ubs a scathing internal report blamed the banks big credit losses on a chronically inadequate system of risk management and laid a big part of that blame on the former ceo for allowing the situation to develop partners cofounders see no risk in the elevation of wuffli  who joined the firms board in  and has steered its risk and audit committee since then  to the chairmanship on the contrary they see it as a crucial step in the evolution of partners into a more mature outfit it will make things better to have someone with peters experience chairing board meetings says gantner adding that wufflis more inclusive less headstrong style has already given board meetings a new level of discussion wuffli himself describes his role as helping the firm transition away from being a predominantly founderled concern to an organization with a durable institutionalized culture im a values person he says the vision of this firm is to be responsible for the dreams of the  million beneficiaries for whom we invest ward rose to become cohead of goldmans equities business and finished at the firm as chairman of goldman sachs asset management international as boss of the iif dallara made his name as a skilled negotiator in several of the financialpolitical crises of the past two decades including the post restructuring of greek debt their private equity experience is as thin as wufflis but gantner who served as chief executive until the firms ipo on the zurich exchange in  stresses that the newcomers do not sit on partners investment committee or take a hand in the big asset allocation calls those matters remain firmly in the hands of gantner wietlisbach and the third cofounder marcel erni who serves as partners chief investment officer andré frei and christoph rubeli who were appointed cochief executives in  take care of daytoday management we felt that we were growing up as a firm and it made sense to get some wise heads in so that we could better start to understand the direction were going in and how we can make sure we flourish as we grow and become more diverse gantner says a firm succeeds if it grows beyond its founders thats not to say the move to open the board up to these highwattage external personalities is without risk whether a firm like partners can maintain the flexibility of thinking that has been its animating spirit to date even as it becomes more institutionalized remains to be seen theres a tradeoff concedes gantner the firm might get a little slower absolutely but we think its a risk worth taking
