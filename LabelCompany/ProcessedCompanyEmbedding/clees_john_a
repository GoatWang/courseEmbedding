insurance salesman and his wife muriel evelyn née cross – his familys surname was originally cheese but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the army during the first world war as a child cleese supported bristol city fc and somerset county cricket club cleese was educated at st peters preparatory school where he received a prize for english and did well at cricket and boxing when he was  he was awarded an exhibition at clifton college an english public school in bristol he was already more than  feet  m tall by then cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds as a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of field marshal earl haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet cleese played cricket in the first xi and did well academically passing  olevels and  alevels in mathematics physics and chemistry in his autobiography so anyway he says that discovering aged  he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook it was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect i believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world he could not go straight to cambridge as the ending of national service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science english geography history and latin he drew on his latin teaching experience later for a scene in life of brian in which he corrects brians badly written latin graffiti he then took up a place he had won at downing college cambridge to read law he also joined the cambridge footlights he recalled that he went to the cambridge guildhall where each university society had a stall and went up to the footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance he replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing he was then asked well what do you do to which he replied i make people laugh at the footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with tim brooketaylor and bill oddie and met his future writing partner graham chapman cleese wrote extra material for the  footlights revue i thought i saw it move and was registrar for the footlights club during  he was also in the cast of the  footlights revue double take cleese graduated from cambridge in  with a  despite his successes on the frost report his father would send him cuttings from the daily telegraph offering management jobs in places like marks and spencer career prepython cleese was a scriptwriter as well as a cast member for the  footlights revue a clump of plinths the revue was so successful at the edinburgh festival fringe that it was renamed cambridge circus and taken to the west end in london and then on a tour of new zealand and broadway with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on the ed sullivan show in october  after cambridge circus cleese briefly stayed in america performing on and offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb complained about gilliams american table manners and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town the first series was screened from  september  on bbc  initially to poor reviews but gained momentum when repeated on bbc  the following year despite this a second series did not air until  by which time cleeses marriage to booth had ended but they revived their collaboration for the second series fawlty towers consisted of only twelve episodes cleese and booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series in december  cleese appeared as a guest star on the muppet show cleese was a fan of the show and cowrote much of the episode cleese also made a

familys surname was originally cheese but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the army during the first world war as a child cleese supported bristol city fc and somerset county cricket club cleese was educated at st peters preparatory school where he received a prize for english and did well at cricket and boxing when he was  he was awarded an exhibition at clifton college an english public school in bristol he was already more than  feet  m tall by then cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds as a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of field marshal earl haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet cleese played cricket in the first xi and did well academically passing  olevels and  alevels in mathematics physics and chemistry in his autobiography so anyway he says that discovering aged  he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook it was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect i believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world he could not go straight to cambridge as the ending of national service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science english geography history and latin he drew on his latin teaching experience later for a scene in life of brian in which he corrects brians badly written latin graffiti he then took up a place he had won at downing college cambridge to read law he also joined the cambridge footlights he recalled that he went to the cambridge guildhall where each university society had a stall and went up to the footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance he replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing he was then asked well what do you do to which he replied i make people laugh at the footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with tim brooketaylor and bill oddie and met his future writing partner graham chapman cleese wrote extra material for the  footlights revue i thought i saw it move and was registrar for the footlights club during  he was also in the cast of the  footlights revue double take cleese graduated from cambridge in  with a  despite his successes on the frost report his father would send him cuttings from the daily telegraph offering management jobs in places like marks and spencer career prepython cleese was a scriptwriter as well as a cast member for the  footlights revue a clump of plinths the revue was so successful at the edinburgh festival fringe that it was renamed cambridge circus and taken to the west end in london and then on a tour of new zealand and broadway with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on the ed sullivan show in october  after cambridge circus cleese briefly stayed in america performing on and offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a

published works  external links early life cleese was born in westonsupermare somerset the only child of reginald francis cleese – an insurance salesman and his wife muriel evelyn née cross – his familys surname was originally cheese but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the army during the first world war as a child cleese supported bristol city fc and somerset county cricket club cleese was educated at st peters preparatory school where he received a prize for english and did well at cricket and boxing when he was  he was awarded an exhibition at clifton college an english public school in bristol he was already more than  feet  m tall by then cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds as a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of field marshal earl haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet cleese played cricket in the first xi and did well academically passing  olevels and  alevels in mathematics physics and chemistry in his autobiography so anyway he says that discovering aged  he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook it was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect i believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world he could not go straight to cambridge as the ending of national service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science english geography history and latin he drew on his latin teaching experience later for a scene in life of brian in which he corrects brians badly written latin graffiti he then took up a place he had won at downing college cambridge to read law he also joined the cambridge footlights he recalled that he went to the cambridge guildhall where each university society had a stall and went up to the footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance he replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing he was then asked well what do you do to which he replied i make people laugh at the footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with tim brooketaylor and bill oddie and met his future writing partner graham chapman cleese wrote extra material for the  footlights revue i thought i saw it move and was registrar for the footlights club during  he was also in the cast of the  footlights revue double take cleese graduated from cambridge in  with a  despite his successes on the frost report his father would send him cuttings from the daily telegraph offering management jobs in places like marks and spencer career prepython cleese was a scriptwriter as well as a cast member for the  footlights revue a clump of plinths the revue was so successful at the edinburgh festival fringe that it was renamed cambridge circus and taken to the west end in london and then on a tour of new zealand and broadway with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on the ed sullivan show in october  after cambridge circus cleese briefly stayed in america performing on and offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb complained about gilliams american table manners and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town the first series was screened from  september  on bbc  initially to poor reviews but gained momentum when repeated on bbc  the following year despite this a second series did not air until  by which time cleeses marriage to booth had ended but they revived their collaboration for the second series fawlty towers consisted of only twelve episodes cleese and booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series in

stranglehold on us if somebody had said that to me when i was  i would have regarded him as a leftwing loony in  cleese publicly supported the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union in the referendum on the issue during thenrepublican nominee donald trumps run for the us presidency in  cleese described trump as a narcissist with no attention span who doesnt have clear ideas about anything and makes it all up as he goes along he had previously described the leadership of the republican party as the most cynical most disgracefully immoral people ive ever come across in a western

trentham divorced in  during this time cleese moved to los angeles in  he married american psychotherapist alyce faye eichelberger they divorced in  the divorce settlement left eichelberger with £ million in finance and assets including £ a year for seven years cleese said what i find so unfair is that if we both died today her children would get much more than mine  i got off lightly think what id have had to pay alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship — such as children or a conversation less than a year later he returned to the uk where he has property in london and

spiegel he was asked if he was religious cleese stated that he didnt think much of organized religion and told he was not committed to anything except the vague feeling that there is something more going on than the materialist reductionist people think cleese has a passion for lemurs following the  comedy film fierce creatures in which the ringtailed lemur played a key role he hosted the  bbc documentary in the wild operation lemur with john cleese which tracked the progress of a reintroduction of blackandwhite ruffed lemurs back into the betampona reserve in madagascar the project had been partly funded by cleeses donation of the proceeds from the london premier of fierce creatures cleese is quoted as saying i adore lemurs theyre extremely gentle wellmannered pretty and yet great fun  i should have married one the bemaraha woolly lemur avahi cleesei also known as cleeses woolly lemur is native to western madagascar the scientist who discovered the species named it after cleese

offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb complained about gilliams american table manners and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town the first series was screened from  september  on bbc  initially to poor reviews but gained momentum when repeated on bbc  the following year despite this a second series did not air until  by which time cleeses marriage to booth had ended but they revived their collaboration for the second series fawlty towers consisted of only twelve episodes cleese and booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series in

familys surname was originally cheese but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the army during the first world war as a child cleese supported bristol city fc and somerset county cricket club cleese was educated at st peters preparatory school where he received a prize for english and did well at cricket and boxing when he was  he was awarded an exhibition at clifton college an english public school in bristol he was already more than  feet  m tall by then cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds as a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of field marshal earl haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet cleese played cricket in the first xi and did well academically passing  olevels and  alevels in mathematics physics and chemistry in his autobiography so anyway he says that discovering aged  he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook it was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect i believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world he could not go straight to cambridge as the ending of national service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science english geography history and latin he drew on his latin teaching experience later for a scene in life of brian in which he corrects brians badly written latin graffiti he then took up a place he had won at downing college cambridge to read law he also joined the cambridge footlights he recalled that he went to the cambridge guildhall where each university society had a stall and went up to the footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance he replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing he was then asked well what do you do to which he replied i make people laugh at the footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with tim brooketaylor and bill oddie and met his future writing partner graham chapman cleese wrote extra material for the  footlights revue i thought i saw it move and was registrar for the footlights club during  he was also in the cast of the  footlights revue double take cleese graduated from cambridge in  with a  despite his successes on the frost report his father would send him cuttings from the daily telegraph offering management jobs in places like marks and spencer career prepython cleese was a scriptwriter as well as a cast member for the  footlights revue a clump of plinths the revue was so successful at the edinburgh festival fringe that it was renamed cambridge circus and taken to the west end in london and then on a tour of new zealand and broadway with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on the ed sullivan show in october  after cambridge circus cleese briefly stayed in america performing on and offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb complained about gilliams american table manners and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town the first series was screened from  september  on bbc  initially to poor reviews but gained momentum when repeated on bbc  the following year despite this a second series did not air until  by which time cleeses marriage to booth had ended but they revived their collaboration for the second series fawlty towers consisted of only twelve episodes cleese and booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series in december  cleese appeared as a guest star on the muppet show cleese was a fan of the show and cowrote much of the episode cleese also made a cameo appearance in their  film the great muppet caper cleese won the tv times award for funniest man on tv – – s and s during the s and s cleese focused on film though he did work with peter cook in his oneoff tv special peter cook and co in  in the same

cook and chapmans partner david sherlock witnessed chapmans death chapmans death occurred a day before the th anniversary of the first broadcast of flying circus with jones commenting the worst case of partypooping in all history cleeses eulogy at chapmans memorial service—in which he became the first person ever at a british memorial service to say fuck—has since become legendary cleese would later play a supporting role in kenneth branaghs adaptation of mary shelleys frankenstein alongside branagh himself and robert de niro he also produced and acted in a number of successful business training films including meetings bloody meetings and more bloody meetings these were produced by his company video arts with robin skynner the group analyst and family therapist cleese wrote two books on relationships families and how to survive them and life and how to survive it the books are presented as a dialogue between skynner and cleese in  cleese declined the british honour of commander of the order of the british empire cbe the followup to a fish called wanda fierce creatures—which again starred cleese alongside kevin kline jamie lee curtis and michael palin—was also released that year but was greeted with mixed reception by critics and audiences cleese has since often stated that making the second film had been a mistake when asked by his friend director and restaurant critic michael winner what he would do differently if he could live his life again cleese responded i wouldnt have married alyce faye eichelberger and i wouldnt have made fierce creatures

fun  i should have married one the bemaraha woolly lemur avahi cleesei also known as cleeses woolly lemur is native to western madagascar the scientist who discovered the species named it after cleese

familys surname was originally cheese but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the army during the first world war as a child cleese supported bristol city fc and somerset county cricket club cleese was educated at st peters preparatory school where he received a prize for english and did well at cricket and boxing when he was  he was awarded an exhibition at clifton college an english public school in bristol he was already more than  feet  m tall by then cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds as a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of field marshal earl haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet cleese played cricket in the first xi and did well academically passing  olevels and  alevels in mathematics physics and chemistry in his autobiography so anyway he says that discovering aged  he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook it was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect i believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world he could not go straight to cambridge as the ending of national service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science english geography history and latin he drew on his latin teaching experience later for a scene in life of brian in which he corrects brians badly written latin graffiti he then took up a place he had won at downing college cambridge to read law he also joined the cambridge footlights he recalled that he went to the cambridge guildhall where each university society had a stall and went up to the footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance he replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing he was then asked well what do you do to which he replied i make people laugh at the footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with tim brooketaylor and bill oddie and met his future writing partner graham chapman cleese wrote extra material for the  footlights revue i thought i saw it move and was registrar for the footlights club during  he was also in the cast of the  footlights revue double take cleese graduated from cambridge in  with a  despite his successes on the frost report his father would send him cuttings from the daily telegraph offering management jobs in places like marks and spencer career prepython cleese was a scriptwriter as well as a cast member for the  footlights revue a clump of plinths the revue was so successful at the edinburgh festival fringe that it was renamed cambridge circus and taken to the west end in london and then on a tour of new zealand and broadway with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on the ed sullivan show in october  after cambridge circus cleese briefly stayed in america performing on and offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb complained about gilliams american table manners and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town the first series was screened from  september  on bbc  initially to poor reviews but gained momentum when repeated on bbc  the following year despite this a second series did not air until  by which time cleeses marriage to booth had ended but they revived their collaboration for the second series fawlty towers consisted of only twelve episodes cleese and booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series in

and his wife muriel evelyn née cross – his familys surname was originally cheese but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the army during the first world war as a child cleese supported bristol city fc and somerset county cricket club cleese was educated at st peters preparatory school where he received a prize for english and did well at cricket and boxing when he was  he was awarded an exhibition at clifton college an english public school in bristol he was already more than  feet  m tall by then cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds as a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of field marshal earl haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet cleese played cricket in the first xi and did well academically passing  olevels and  alevels in mathematics physics and chemistry in his autobiography so anyway he says that discovering aged  he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook it was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect i believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world he could not go straight to cambridge as the ending of national service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science english geography history and latin he drew on his latin teaching experience later for a scene in life of brian in which he corrects brians badly written latin graffiti he then took up a place he had won at downing college cambridge to read law he also joined the cambridge footlights he recalled that he went to the cambridge guildhall where each university society had a stall and went up to the footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance he replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing he was then asked well what do you do to which he replied i make people laugh at the footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with tim brooketaylor and bill oddie and met his future writing partner graham chapman cleese wrote extra material for the  footlights revue i thought i saw it move and was registrar for the footlights club during  he was also in the cast of the  footlights revue double take cleese graduated from cambridge in  with a  despite his successes on the frost report his father would send him cuttings from the daily telegraph offering management jobs in places like marks and spencer career prepython cleese was a scriptwriter as well as a cast member for the  footlights revue a clump of plinths the revue was so successful at the edinburgh festival fringe that it was renamed cambridge circus and taken to the west end in london and then on a tour of new zealand and broadway with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on the ed sullivan show in october  after cambridge circus cleese briefly stayed in america performing on and offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb complained about gilliams american table manners and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town the first series was screened from  september  on bbc  initially to poor reviews but gained momentum when repeated on bbc  the following year despite this a second series did not air until  by which time cleeses marriage to booth had ended but they revived their collaboration for the second series fawlty towers consisted of only twelve episodes cleese and booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series in december  cleese appeared as a guest star on the muppet show cleese was a fan of the show and cowrote much of the episode cleese also made a

external links early life cleese was born in westonsupermare somerset the only child of reginald francis cleese – an insurance salesman and his wife muriel evelyn née cross – his familys surname was originally cheese but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the army during the first world war as a child cleese supported bristol city fc and somerset county cricket club cleese was educated at st peters preparatory school where he received a prize for english and did well at cricket and boxing when he was  he was awarded an exhibition at clifton college an english public school in bristol he was already more than  feet  m tall by then cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds as a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of field marshal earl haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet cleese played cricket in the first xi and did well academically passing  olevels and  alevels in mathematics physics and chemistry in his autobiography so anyway he says that discovering aged  he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook it was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect i believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world he could not go straight to cambridge as the ending of national service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science english geography history and latin he drew on his latin teaching experience later for a scene in life of brian in which he corrects brians badly written latin graffiti he then took up a place he had won at downing college cambridge to read law he also joined the cambridge footlights he recalled that he went to the cambridge guildhall where each university society had a stall and went up to the footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance he replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing he was then asked well what do you do to which he replied i make people laugh at the footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with tim brooketaylor and bill oddie and met his future writing partner graham chapman cleese wrote extra material for the  footlights revue i thought i saw it move and was registrar for the footlights club during  he was also in the cast of the  footlights revue double take cleese graduated from cambridge in  with a  despite his successes on the frost report his father would send him cuttings from the daily telegraph offering management jobs in places like marks and spencer career prepython cleese was a scriptwriter as well as a cast member for the  footlights revue a clump of plinths the revue was so successful at the edinburgh festival fringe that it was renamed cambridge circus and taken to the west end in london and then on a tour of new zealand and broadway with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on the ed sullivan show in october  after cambridge circus cleese briefly stayed in america performing on and offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb complained about gilliams american table manners and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town the first series was screened from  september  on bbc  initially to poor reviews but gained momentum when repeated on bbc  the following year despite this a second series did not air until  by which time cleeses marriage to booth had ended but they revived their collaboration for the second series fawlty towers consisted of only twelve episodes cleese and booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series in december  cleese appeared as a guest star on the muppet show cleese was a fan of the show and cowrote much of the episode cleese also made a cameo appearance in their  film the great muppet caper cleese won the tv times award for funniest man on tv – – s and s during the s and s cleese focused on film though he did work with peter cook in his oneoff tv special peter cook and co in  in the same year cleese played petruchio in shakespeares the taming of the shrew in the bbc television shakespeare series in  he starred with sean connery and michael palin in the terry gilliamdirected time bandits as robin hood he also participated in monty python live at the hollywood bowl  and starred in the secret policemans ball for amnesty international in  cleese had a small dramatic role as a sheriff in silverado which had an allstar cast that included kevin kline with whom he would star in a fish called wanda three years later in  he starred in clockwise as an uptight school headmaster obsessed with punctuality and constantly getting into trouble during a journey to speak at the headmasters conference cleese at the  academy awards timed with the  uk elections he appeared in a video promoting proportional representation in  he wrote and starred in a fish called wanda as the lead archie leach along with jamie lee curtis kevin kline and michael palin wanda was a commercial and critical success and cleese was nominated for an academy award for his script cynthia cleese starred as leachs daughter graham chapman was diagnosed with throat cancer in  cleese michael palin peter cook and chapmans partner david sherlock witnessed chapmans death chapmans death occurred a day before the th anniversary of the first broadcast of flying circus with jones commenting the worst case of partypooping in all history cleeses eulogy at chapmans memorial service—in which he became the first person ever at a british memorial service to say fuck—has since become legendary cleese would later play a supporting role in kenneth branaghs adaptation of mary shelleys frankenstein alongside branagh himself and robert de niro he also produced and acted in a number of successful business

reginald francis cleese – an insurance salesman and his wife muriel evelyn née cross – his familys surname was originally cheese but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the army during the first world war as a child cleese supported bristol city fc and somerset county cricket club cleese was educated at st peters preparatory school where he received a prize for english and did well at cricket and boxing when he was  he was awarded an exhibition at clifton college an english public school in bristol he was already more than  feet  m tall by then cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds as a prank by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of field marshal earl haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet cleese played cricket in the first xi and did well academically passing  olevels and  alevels in mathematics physics and chemistry in his autobiography so anyway he says that discovering aged  he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook it was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect i believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world he could not go straight to cambridge as the ending of national service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science english geography history and latin he drew on his latin teaching experience later for a scene in life of brian in which he corrects brians badly written latin graffiti he then took up a place he had won at downing college cambridge to read law he also joined the cambridge footlights he recalled that he went to the cambridge guildhall where each university society had a stall and went up to the footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance he replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing he was then asked well what do you do to which he replied i make people laugh at the footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with tim brooketaylor and bill oddie and met his future writing partner graham chapman cleese wrote extra material for the  footlights revue i thought i saw it move and was registrar for the footlights club during  he was also in the cast of the  footlights revue double take cleese graduated from cambridge in  with a  despite his successes on the frost report his father would send him cuttings from the daily telegraph offering management jobs in places like marks and spencer career prepython cleese was a scriptwriter as well as a cast member for the  footlights revue a clump of plinths the revue was so successful at the edinburgh festival fringe that it was renamed cambridge circus and taken to the west end in london and then on a tour of new zealand and broadway with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on the ed sullivan show in october  after cambridge circus cleese briefly stayed in america performing on and offbroadway while performing in the musical half a sixpence cleese met future python terry gilliam as well as american actress connie booth whom he married on  february  at their wedding at a unitarian church in manhattan the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language the only moment of disappointment cleese recalled came at the very end of the service when i discovered that id failed to excise one particular mention of the word god later booth would become a writing partner he was soon offered work as a writer with bbc radio where he worked on several programmes most notably as a sketch writer for the dick emery show the success of the footlights revue led to the recording of a short series of halfhour radio programmes called im sorry ill read that again which were so popular that the bbc commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from  to  cleese returned to britain and joined the cast in many episodes he is credited as john otto cleese according to jem roberts this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name marwood also in  cleese and chapman began writing on the frost report the writing staff chosen for the frost report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy they included coperformers from im sorry ill read that again and future goodies bill oddie and tim brooketaylor and also frank muir barry cryer marty feldman ronnie barker ronnie corbett dick vosburgh and future python members eric idle terry jones and michael palin while working on the frost report the future pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant cleeses and chapmans sketches often involved authority figures some of whom were performed by cleese while jones and palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas idle was one of those charged with writing david frosts monologue during this period cleese met and befriended influential british comedian peter cook it was as a performer on the frost report that cleese achieved his breakthrough on british television as a comedy actor appearing as the tall patrician figure in the classic class sketch contrasting comically in a lineup with the shorter middle class ronnie barker and the even shorter working class ronnie corbett this series was so popular that in  cleese and chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with brooketaylor and feldman on at last the  show during which time the four yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writersperformers the four yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a monty python sketch cleese and chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of doctor in the house and later cleese wrote six episodes of doctor at large on his own in  these series were successful and in  cleese and chapman were offered their very own series however owing to chapmans alcoholism cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was therefore unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them he had found working with palin on the frost report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series palin had previously been working on do not adjust your set with idle and jones with terry gilliam creating the animations the four of them had on the back of the success of do not adjust your set been offered a series for thames television which they were waiting to begin when cleeses offer arrived palin agreed to work with cleese and chapman in the meantime bringing with him gilliam jones and idle monty python monty pythons flying circus ran for four seasons from october  to december  on bbc television though cleese quit the show after the third cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressedout loony he portrayed the former as a series of announcers tv show hosts and government officials for example the ministry of silly walks the latter is perhaps best represented in the cheese shop and by cleeses mr praline character the man with a dead norwegian blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named eric he was also known for his working class sergeant major character who worked as a police sergeant roman centurion etc he is also seen as the opening announcer with the now famous line and now for something completely different although in its premiere in the sketch man with three buttocks the phrase was spoken by eric idle partnership with graham chapman along with gilliams animations cleeses work with graham chapman provided python with its darkest and angriest moments and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of basil fawlty unlike palin and jones cleese and chapman wrote together in the same room cleese claims that their writing partnership involved cleese doing most of the work while chapman sat back not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level a classic example of this is the dead parrot sketch envisaged by cleese as a satire on poor customer service which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car this version was actually performed and broadcast on the prepython special how to irritate people it was chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a norwegian blue giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason like chapman cleeses poker face clipped middle class accent and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures such as policemen detectives nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine most famously in the ministry of silly walks sketch actually written by palin and jones cleese exploits his stature as the cranelegged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office chapman and cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects such as in the cheese shop the dead parrot sketch and argument clinic where cleese plays a stonefaced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless trivial bickering all of these roles were opposite palin who cleese often claims is his favourite python to work with—the comic contrast between the towering cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series occasionally the typical cleese–palin dynamic is reversed as in fish licence wherein palin plays the bureaucrat with whom cleese is trying to work though the programme lasted four series by the start of series  cleese was growing tired of dealing with chapmans alcoholism he felt too that the shows scripts had declined in quality for these reasons he became restless and decided to move on though he stayed for the third series he officially left the group before the fourth season despite this he remained friendly with the group and all six began writing monty python and the holy grail cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series cleese returned to the troupe to cowrite and costar in the monty python films monty python and the holy grail monty pythons life of brian and monty pythons the meaning of life and participated in various live performances over the years postpython activities from  to  cleese served as rector of the university of st andrews his election proved a milestone for the university revolutionising and modernising the post for instance the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an assessor a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence cleese changed this into a position for a student elected across campus by the student body resulting in direct access and representation for the student body around this time cleese worked with comedian les dawson on his sketchstandup show sez les the differences between the two physically the tall lean cleese and the short stout dawson and socially the public school and then cambridgeeducated cleese and the working class selfeducated mancunian dawson were marked but both worked well together from series  onwards until the series ended in  fawlty towers main article fawlty towers cleese achieved greater prominence in the united kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager basil fawlty in fawlty towers which he cowrote with his wife connie booth the series won three bafta awards when produced and in  it topped the british film institutes list of the  greatest british television programmes the series also featured prunella scales as basils acerbic wife sybil andrew sachs as the much abused spanish waiter manuel  hes from barcelona and booth as waitress polly the series voice of sanity cleese based basil fawlty on a real person donald sinclair whom he had encountered in  while the monty python team were staying at the gleneagles hotel in torquay while filming inserts for their television series reportedly cleese was inspired by sinclairs mantra i could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests he later described sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man i have ever met although sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series during the pythons stay sinclair allegedly threw idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb complained about gilliams american table manners and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town the first series was screened from  september  on bbc  initially to poor reviews but gained momentum when repeated on bbc  the following year despite this a second series did not air until  by which time cleeses marriage to booth had ended but they revived their collaboration for the second series fawlty towers consisted of only twelve episodes cleese and booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series in december  cleese appeared as a guest star on the muppet show

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
