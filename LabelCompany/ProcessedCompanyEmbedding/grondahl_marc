brotherly dispute may impair planet fitnesss public offering by bob sanders published august   michael grondahl left chris rondeau center and marc grondahl right photo courtesy of planet fitness the last minute disclosure of a brotherly legal dispute might mar planet fitness’s 00 million initial public offering that’s expected to take place on thursday michael grondahl who cofounded the newington nh company along with his brother marc back in  contacted the company via his lawyer on july  shortly after planet fitness’s intention to go public became public according to a us securities and exchange commission filing on wednesday michael grondahl the former ceo left the company back in  just after most of it was sold to tsg consumer partners for about half billion dollars marc remained with the company along with current ceo chris rondeau who joined the company back in  michael grondahl said wednesdays’ filing “expressed concerns with the separation agreement” when he resigned as well as the agreement executed in october  when he sold his remaining holdings  he also expressed the view that the noncompete clause which expires in november  “may not be enforceable” and expressed his desire to be excused from “certain indemnification obligations”  the company said his claims are “without merit” and intend to “vigorously contest” them although they have initiated arbitration procedures about the sale of his stock there is no indication that a suit was actually filed the company didn’t think that the dispute would have a material adverse effect on its financial results neither michael grondahl nor the company could be reached at deadline rondeau is expected to give out interviews the day after the ipo but canceled his interview with nh business review because of “schedule changes” before the sec filing the company also disclosed its preliminary second quarter results on the eve of the ipo   it estimates that it will report an income between 0 or  million compared to  million in the first quarter and  million the same quarter of 0 revenues for the quarter are estimated at  million  percent compared to the same quarter last year  that’s partly because the company has more stores it’s now up to 0 with the last  coming in this last quarter all but one of them is franchise owned a year ago it had  stores planet fitness which has more than  million members expects the rapid expansion to continue aiming to quadruple the number of gyms in the near further the franchise expansion should occur mainly in the united states in the south and west and overseas but it also could increase staffing at the company’s newington headquarters which currently employees about 00  in may the company threatened to move its headquarters out of the granite state unless the legislature passed a law lowering the state tax burden on partnerships that go public lawmakers passed such a change broadening it to include more businesses but governor maggie hassan vetoed it though she offered to include some version of it in a compromise budget that would cost the state about  million  the proceeds of the ipo would mainly go to private equity firm tsg as well as those who currently hold stock including rondeau and marc grondahl michal grondahl doesn’t appear to hold any stock though some of the stores are leased to his real estate companies    the stock would be listed on new york stock exchange under the ticker “plnt” for an estimated  to  a share planet fitness shareholders will get about ten percent of a firm that is short on cash – about  million

entrepreneurship and human interest topics katies work has appeared in hemispheres usa today consumers digest crains chicago business and others read more of her work at wwwkatiemorellcom nearly every entrepreneur strives to achieve market disruption—the kind that creates controversy conversation and ultimately adoption from droves of customers marc grondahl is a master of disruption he is cofounder of planet fitness a newington new hampshirebased chain of workout facilities that opened in  and now has more than  locations nationwide and a reported  million members the company’s runaway success can be attributed to several factors 0 monthly dues free pizza on monday nights no group workout classes and a strict policy against lunkheads “the stereotypical bodybuilder who drops weights loudly in the gym and creates a bad atmosphere an intimidating atmosphere” grondahl explains “when we see one of those we sound an alarm” the alarm is no joke when a lunk is found traipsing around a planet fitness location employees trigger ambulancestyle flashing lights and screeching sirens bodybuilders inevitably flee in embarrassment … and usually proceed to write seething comments about the company on message boards related how a lunch craving turned into a m business the alarm is a strategic move “we are going after the  percent of the population that isn’t hardcore fit” grondahl says “we want people to feel comfortable and accepted here no matter what their workout level” planet fitness’ unorthodox business model is at the core of grondahl’s advice for entrepreneurs starting out “just be true to yourself if you have an idea even if it is an unpopular idea be tough and don’t give up don’t be afraid to do things differently take me back to the early days how did you get the idea to open a gym mike marc’s brother and cofounder and i were about three years out of college and hated our jobs he was working in real estate and i was doing accounting at a manufacturing company we saw that a gold’s gym in leominster massachusetts was going through bankruptcy and decided to buy it it wasn’t the right decision we ended up getting evicted you got evicted from your first location what happened we didn’t have enough experience the location was bad and it didn’t have enough parking there were lots of problems we went back to the drawing board and started again in  with a new location which turned out much better at first we were coastal fitness we changed the name to planet fitness in  what challenges did you face starting out both mike and i secondguessed ourselves a lot in the beginning we didn’t have much money so we lived in our first gym for at least six months until we could afford an apartment beyond that pricing was a challenge we started by offering memberships at  for a year which was great because a lot of people would sign up but then we wouldn’t have any guaranteed renewals for the following year for the first five or so years we experimented with different pricing models and went up to  per month we found that people really appreciated the 0 per month price point so we stuck with that how are you able to price your memberships so low it comes down to our business model we run hour gyms with  employees each we don’t have salespeople group exercise classes or child care everything is streamlined when did things start picking up for planet fitness we had a few gyms in the early 000s but things really got going in 0 when we started franchising we started with six franchises that year and growth has exploded ever since especially in inner city areas we’ve done really well in places like brooklyn the bronx and harlem we offer an affordable clean place for people to work out with air conditioning and flat screen tvs whats it like to work at planet fitness it is a fun and collaborative environment we have about  people at our corporate office and i’d say at least half of them came right from the gyms our vp of marketing worked at a gym desk while in college we are really proud of our retention rates our main salesperson has been with us for  years we try to involve our staff in big decisions and encourage them to be part of our growth a number of great ideas have come from our staff including our minute circuit training—a partitioned section in most planet fitness locations today related how coffee kicked a bike shop into high gear how have two brothers been able to work together for so long and keep the peace laughs well it was hard in the beginning when we started out we were both doing the same things which we quickly learned wasn’t going to work we brought in consultants in the late s and realized that we needed to focus on our specializations for me that was accounting for michael it was marketing and the creative side of the business i recommend other members of family businesses do the same make sure your roles are defined it makes life much better meet more inspiring entrepreneurs
