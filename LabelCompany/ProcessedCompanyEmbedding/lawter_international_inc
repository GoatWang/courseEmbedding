sales  million in  sics  printing ink  plastics materials  resins  inorganic pigments company history lawter international inc manufactures and markets specialty chemicals for the printing ink industry its founder william j terra is credited with developing a printing process that revolutionized the magazine industry and made weekly publications such as life and time possible in addition to its printing ink vehicles and slip additives which give printing inks their ability to carry color onto a variety of surfaces lawters core products include fluorescent pigments and coatings thermographic compounds used to produce raised lettering on stationery and synthetic and hydrocarbon resin used for printing inks varnishes and lining beverage cans lawter sells to both large and small ink manufacturers such as basf dianippon ink and chemicals coateslorilleux and toyo the company devotes a good portion of revenues to research and development and operates according to a customerdriven marketing strategy which strives to anticipate customer needs headquartered in northbrook illinois lawter operates  plants located in the united states canada china denmark england ireland italy singapore and spain the company reported record earnings in  of  million on sales of  million the success of lawter international can be traced to the inquisitive and ambitious mind of founder william j terra terra was the son of an italian lithographer who had emigrated to the united states at a young age in  terra was a researcher with the columbian carbon corp of philadelphia pennsylvania always interested in printing and the chemical properties of ink terra persuaded the companys chief to permit him to lead a research team to investigate an idea he had toyed while studying chemical engineering at pennsylvania state university he believed that a specific formulation of ink compounds might speed up the process of printing and drying ink within a year terras team had developed an ink compound that would allow highspeed presses to print color magazines in  hoursremarkably shorter than the  days previously required the discovery was a major development for the printing industryin fact it was one of the first major changes for nearly a centuryand immediately revolutionized certain segments of the industry the first magazine to adopt the new process was the saturday evening post in  r r donnelley  sons of chicago won an important contract to print a new weekly photo magazine called life using terras ink compounds columbian carbon sent terra to chicago to supervise the printing the magazine was successful and terra was promoted to head up the companys chicago plant but terra was ambitious and wanted to set off on his own in  he borrowed  from a friend named john lawson and founded lawter chemicals to develop and market new technologies for the printing industry the company manufactured printing ink vehicles and florescents at its new plant in skokie illinois despite terras success at developing new products the companys early years were difficult and when world war ii erupted terra closed shop and served in the us navy upon his return in  he reopened the company but again business was sluggish for ten years lawter grew slowly a second plant was opened in newark new jersey in  yet terra struggled then in  terra was asked to join the executive management team of a major chemical firm the company offered him a salary of  per yearmore than four times what terra was then making terra considered closing his company and accepting the post but after speaking with his wife adeline he decided to engage a management consulting firm to investigate whether lawter had a chance of success i still have the report terra said in the chicago tribune in the final analysis it said the product line was good the industry was excellent and the potential was much better than average in every way there was really only one thing wrong and that was the management they went on and outlined what entrepreneurs did wrong that entrepreneurs think theyre so much better at every phase of a business than everyone else that they make the mistake of trying to do everything themselves terra took the consultants advice and borrowed money to hire a top research director as well as experienced marketing financial and advertising executives sales improved under the new management team and by  lawters cash reserves and equity were strong enough to purchase krumbhaar chemical inc a wellrespected manufacturer of synthetic resins a third plant was quickly built in san leandro california in  the company purchased a rawmaterials supplier and established lawter chemicals canada ltd as a wholly owned subsidiary to produce and market printing ink vehicles in canada by  the company had a stong enough balance sheet to make its first public offering by  lawters printing ink vehicles resins and florescents were being sold to manufacturers throughout the united states and canada as well as in central and south america europe australia the philippines japan and south africa sales had grown from  million in  to  million in  earnings grew from  to  in  the company opened its fifth production plant in ontario canada and one year later it established a european subsidiary to producing synthetic resins and printing ink vehicles in belgium by  net sales of  million were more than double  figures and earnings had tripled to  that year the company made its third acquisition american lithographic varnish co a manufacturer of printing ink vehicles that provided lawter with an expanded product line improved distribution and stronger research and development capabilities research and development continued to play a strong role in the companys growth by   percent of company sales were generated by proprietary goods created in lawters laboratories lawter acquired two more companies in the early s virkotype corp a thermographic printing business and stresenreuter international the illinoisbased ink vehicles and synthetic resin division of international minerals and chemical corp during this time lawters profits were affected by raw materials shortages that raised the cost of goods produced but by  lawter was able to institute a significant price increase that began to cover the higher materials prices the company achieved record sales of  million in  with earnings of  million the following year sales dropped by  percent to  million but earnings rose to  million fueled in part by a stabilized market for raw materials lawter continued its expansion in europe and by  it operated six subsidiary plants in canada belgium great britain the netherlands and germany in  the company reported record earnings for the th consecutive year sales too reached a record level of  million the following year lawter acquired dyall products inc a producer of ink additives and related products for an undisclosed amount of stock and other securities lawters growth wasand continues to befueled by a combination of careful acquisitions and aggressive new product development the company was quick to respond to changing conditions in the printing industry introducing in  the local line of printing inks which were formulated to reduce the amount of energy required for drying ink the local inks were also noteworthy because they were not photochemically reactive and thus did not convert to smog when exposed to sunlight expansion through europe continued into the s as subsidiaries were established in spain denmark and france sales reached  million with earnings of  million however the decade was marked by uncertainties and difficulties in  an explosion at lawters bensonville illinois plant injured six workmen and destroyed a wing of the plant causing a work stoppage of ten days and more than  in damage although sales in europe grew briskly profits gains were undercut by the strength of the us dollar on overseas markets and a sharp increase in the european prices of raw materials in  despite this lawter remained optimistic noting that  to  percent of the demand at its new european plants were from new customers in  lawter surprised the investment community by putting itself on the auction block looking for a possible sale or merger analysts assumed the reason was because terra at age  wanted to sell out indeed lawters founder had accepted the post of ambassadoratlarge for cultural affairs in the ronald reagan administration and had moved to washington dc to fulfill his duties terra had also grown into an avid collector of american art and in april  he oversaw the construction of the terra museum of modern art a  million facility in downtown chicago that held the familys extensive collection of thcentury american paintings by february  lawter had taken itself off the auction block allegedly because of the october  stock market crash which cut the companys share price by almost  percent to  per share company officials also predicted excellent prospects for  and beyond and set about to prove their predictions in  the chicago tribune declared lawter has become a hot performer in the past five years raising sales and earnings by aggressive selling of new products earnings nearly doubled between  and  to  million on sales of  million new products included ultrex an environmentfriendly line of fastdrying ink vehicles using soybean oil in place of petroleum products and luminex an easyformulating vehicle that adds gloss to inks in  the company also acquired ampac powders  wax compounds lawter continued to outsell its competition in  launching at least  new products and capturing record sales of  million the company seemed in excellent shape as it entered  although the printing trade in the united states was in a slump magazines and directmail catalogs decreased circulation after years of strong growth lawter had been able to weather the downturn on the strength of its overseas salesnearly  percent of overall sales the companys balance sheet was strong with sizeable cash reserves and lawter began shopping for another acquisition in august  lawter launched a hostile bid offering  million for hach co which was based in loveland colorado hach was a manufacturer of laboratory instruments and kits used to analyze the chemical content of water lawter already owned  percent of hach and as terra told the chicago tribune that year hoped to take control of the company in order to expand into a new dynamic market on a direct basis the deal fell through however when the hach family which held a  percent interest in the company refused to cede their shares crains chicago business hypothesized that the proposed merger may well have failed over a clash of executives personalities noting that both terra and hach chairman kathryn hachdarrow retained firm control of the companies they founded despite their respective ages of  and  but the reason may simply have been that hach management did not feel comfortable with the alliance from a technological standpoint there are no synergies between the two companies hachs chief financial officer told crains and i dont think there would be marketing synergies either the two companies make very different products revenues rose to  million in  but costs rose at an even quicker pace and net income dropped a whopping  percent to  million the sharp decline in earnings was caused by volatile european currencies and low interest rates on the companys large investment portfolio lawter was well prepared to weather the earnings drop however and by  sales had increased  percent to  million and earnings jumped to a record  million in addition in june  lawter acquired cremona resine sa an italian manufacturer of synthetic resins and began construction of a stateoftheart resin manufacturing plant in pleasant prairie wisconsin the pleasant prairie plant was to produce environmentfriendly waterbased acrylic resin and would double the companys output of resins in the united states while replacing outdated plants in bensonville and addison illinois shortly after the new plant opened an explosion occurred in one wing of the facility causing minor injuries to two employees and extensive damage by  the pleasant prairie plant was in full operation although restart costs impaired profits for the year in  lawter commenced construction of a plant in antwerp belgium intended to produce printing ink vehicles synthetic resins and specialty additives for the european market it was scheduled to go on line in late  lawter seems to be in a strong position as it nears its sixth decade of operation company president richard d nordman continues to develop his own management strategy and style as terra begins to assume a less active role in the daily operation of the business although fluctuations in the price of raw materials soybeans resin oils linseed rosin and dimer have the potential to greatly affect the companys profit margins lawter has for the most part avoided great losses by diversifying its market base and by taking a buyeroriented approach to selling its products lawter has always been a technologydriven company that tries to anticipate customer needs its sales force interacts with customers on a onetoone level which allows the company to customize products for individual customers and to more easily pass on increases and discounts in the price of raw goods used to manufacture its products in the future the company plans to grow by improving efficiency offering new product lines and international expansion as for acquisitions outside its line of business such as the failed hach merger we have an open mind nordman told crains chicago business in  we

for appellants  albert e jenner jr of chicago for appellees affirmed in part and reversed in part justice jiganti delivered the opinion of the court these consolidated appeals and crossappeal involving preliminary injunctive relief derive from an action instituted by the plaintiff lawter international inc lawter to restrain the defendants john r carroll james a carroll richard m bradley and carroll scientific inc from competing with lawter and from disclosing trade secrets three broad issues are raised by the parties on appeal by john r carroll whether the trial court erred in issuing a preliminary injunction against john carroll on november   on crossappeal by lawter whether the trial court erred in failing to extend preliminary injunctive relief to include james carroll and richard bradley on november   and a subsequent crossappeal by carroll scientific as to what is the legal effect of the preliminary injunction which the court issued against carroll scientific on january   the original complaint filed by lawter in this action arose out of the fact that john carroll was vicepresident of manufacturing of dyall products inc a company which made wax compounds for printing ink john carroll also owned an option to purchase  of the stock in dyall in  dyall began to negotiate a sale to lawter pursuant to these negotiations lawter demanded that john carroll enter into an employment agreement with dyall which would become part of the sale to lawter the agreement contained a noncompetition covenant which forbade competition with lawter for the longer of five years from the date of the contract or three years after termination of employment and a trade secrets covenant with no apparent time limit which forbade the use or disclosure of lawters trade secrets specific relevant language in the noncompetition covenant is the following noncompetition a employee    shall not directly or indirectly engage in competition with    lawter chemicals inc or any of its subsidiaries i in any line of business which any of such corporations is presently conducting or ii in any line of business which any of such corporations may conduct in the future with respect to which employee may become personally involved pursuant to his employment hereunder and employee shall not render assistance of any kind to any person firm or any corporation who or which may be in such  competition emphasis added the covenant then contains a detailed description of the business presently being conducted by lawter this covenant closes with language which states employee shall not be bound by the provisions of this subparagraph a in the event of termination of his employment hereunder by the company without a breach hereof by the employee emphasis added specific relevant language in the trade secrets covenant is the following trade secrets b employee recognizes and acknowledges the value to the company of its business secrets including the methods processes formulae inventions research knowhow technical data marketing information and other proprietary information developed by it and to be developed by it in the future in the conduct of its business in the production of chemicals and other products employee agrees    that such shall be and remain in the exclusive property of the company and that he shall have no rights thereto or interest therein employee agrees that    he will hold such trade secrets confidential and will not disclose the same to any other person firm or corporation    employee agrees that upon any termination of his employment by the company    employee will deliver to the company all documents records notebooks and similar material containing any of such trade secrets which are at that time in his possession emphasis added john carroll exercised his option to purchase the dyall stock and upon closing of the sale of dyall to lawter on january   received payment from lawter in the amount of  on this date john carroll executed a letter to dyall in which he resigned as vicepresidentmanufacturing of dyall but specifically reaffirmed the fact that the letter did not constitute a resignation from my position as an employee    under the employment agreement    john carroll was then employed by lawter in various capacities including lawters national sales manager from january   until he resigned four years later sometime in august  while still employed by lawter john carroll began planning to go into business to manufacture wax compounds for printing ink toward this end john carroll joined with his brother james carroll who was also employed by lawter to form carroll scientific inc a loan for  was procured from the  new lenox state bank in order to procure the loan the president of the new lenox bank was taken on tour of lawters dyall plant james carroll then began to purchase equipment for carroll scientific and also began designing a plant over the next few months the carrolls devised a marketing plan for carroll scientific and a sales effort was commenced by john carroll which included calls on lawterdyall customers as part of the planning process john carroll also consulted with an attorney who advised him that the noncompetition covenant in his employment agreement with lawter was unenforceable on january   john carroll resigned from lawter and on january   james carroll also resigned richard m bradley a chemist with lawterdyall also resigned from lawter at that time and became affiliated with carroll scientific on march   lawter commenced the immediate action against defendants john carroll james carroll richard bradley and carroll scientific inc lawter filed a verified complaint for injunctive relief an accounting and damages an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction and a motion for expedited access to the premises of carroll scientific inc in the underlying action lawter prayed that the defendants be enjoined from using the confidential proprietary business information of lawter which the defendants had obtained or learned while in its employ that the defendants be enjoined from soliciting and contacting lawterdyalls customers for possible sale of competitive products and that the defendants be enjoined from competing with lawterdyall the temporary restraining order also directed the defendants to return any and all lawter documents in their possession on the same day march   and prior to the hearing on the motion for the temporary restraining order the defendant filed a verified answer denying the material allegations of the complaint and also interposing an affirmative defense that john carrolls noncompetition covenant was unenforceable under illinois law because among other things it had no geographical limitations the trial court entered the temporary restraining order against all defendants on march   the order specifically stated that its purpose was to maintain defendants status quo until the motion on a preliminary injunction could be fully considered the order also set specific dates for the hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction this order was appealed by the defendants on procedural grounds and affirmed in lawter international inc v carroll   ill app d   ned  in substance the temporary restraining order stated that lawter  had a clear right to the protection of its confidential proprietary business information that lawter had a clear right to protection under the noncompetition and confidential proprietary business information covenants in john carrolls employment agreement and that john carroll and james carroll possessed certain confidential proprietary business information belonging to dyall which might be used by carroll scientific when it competed with dyall the court also concluded that lawter was likely to prevail on the merits of its claim that john r carroll had breached valid noncompetition and confidential business information covenants in the employment agreement and on its claim that the defendants james carroll bradley and carroll scientific had joined with john carroll in conspiring to breach their fiduciary duties to lawter and to misappropriate lawters proprietary business information the court also concluded that the plaintiff would suffer serious immediate and irreparable injury for which no adequate remedy at law existed if a temporary restraining order was not granted while the hearing on the preliminary injunction was in progress and the temporary restraining order was on appeal discovery between the parties went forward lawter discovered that the defendants had in their possession several boxes of business information belonging to dyall the boxes contained documents relating to dollar volume sales to dyall customers the location shipping address telephone number and contact person for each customer information on the quantity of products sold to each customer the accounts receivable generated through the sales lists of dyalls major suppliers with information on quantities ordered plant costs and expenses profitability reports operating statements and a laboratory notebook of a dyall laboratory chemist lawter also was able to ascertain that the defendants had devised certain product formulae from dyall formulae during the duration of these extensive hearings on the preliminary injunction the trial court kept the temporary restraining order in place in order to preserve the status quo on november   the trial court entered its order on the preliminary injunction based upon the evidence before it the trial court made numerous findings of fact and law which are summarized here the court found that john carroll had knowingly breached covenants in his employment agreement prohibiting competition appropriation and disclosure of confidential business information that the covenants in the employment agreement were ancillary to the sale of dyall to lawter that the agreement survived the sale and that carroll had received  in consideration for the agreement and the  sale of his interest in dyall that lawter would sustain irreparable injury if john carroll were allowed to use the confidential information including customer lists which he had acquired during his association with dyall that lawter had shown a likelihood of success on the merits because the purpose of the noncompetition covenant was primarily to protect lawter from losing its longstanding near permanent customer relationships to a former employee and not to seek to preclude john r carroll from soliciting every ink maker in the world that john carroll had already solicited  of the largest lawterdyall accounts located in the united states and canada that the fiveyear time limit after the date of contract or threeyear time limit after the date of employment termination for the covenant was not unreasonable in relation to the nature of the interest that lawter was trying to protect that john carroll had acquired certain confidential information regarding formulae and valuable documents which he had misappropriated and that the return of such documents did not preempt preliminary injunctive relief in regard to james a carroll and richard bradley the court found that the evidence did not support the conclusion that they had conspired with john to breach his employment agreement to breach their independent fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff to misappropriate documents containing the plaintiffs confidential business information or that any judicial protection should be extended to lawter on their behalf for a period beyond the time required for reverse engineering which had already passed finally the court found that there was no reason under these facts to engage in any balancing of the equities and similarly under these facts there was no showing that the plaintiff had come before the court with unclean hands after making these findings of fact and law the court entered the following order which is quoted and summarized below  john carroll was preliminarily enjoined and prohibited from soliciting or otherwise contacting any longterm existing customers of lawter or its dyall products division for the purpose of selling or offering products competitive with the products sold by lawter or its dyall products division  john carroll was also preliminarily enjoined from having any interest financial or otherwise direct or indirect in any business entity which solicits or otherwise contacts any longterm existing customers of lawter or its dyall products division for the purpose of selling or offering products competitive with products sold by lawter or its dyall products division   john carroll was preliminarily enjoined from revealing to anyone or using for competition with lawter or its dyall products division lawters or its dyall products divisions confidential product formulas manufacturing and protection processes marketing information research and development information and customer requirements information whether written or memorized based in any way upon certain plaintiffs exhibits  the temporary restraining order as to james a carroll and richard m bradley only is hereby dissolved emphasis added it is important to note that neither the courts findings of fact or law nor the above order made any specific independent mention of carroll scientific based upon these conclusions of fact and law the court then entered an order which preserved the injunctive relief against john r carroll and denied injunctive relief as to defendants james carroll and bradley john carroll appealed from this preliminary injunction order on november   and lawter crossappealed shortly thereafter although carroll scientific is named in the notice of crossappeal no relief is requested as to carroll scientific in the crossappeal carroll scientific is the subject of the january   order and the appeal from that order john carroll claimed in his appeal that the court erred in its conclusion that the employment agreement was valid and a proper foundation upon which to grant lawter a preliminary injunction enjoining his business activities lawter claimed in its crossappeal that the court erred when it failed to include james carroll and bradley in the order for a preliminary injunction in response to certain actions taken by the defendants while these appeals were pending lawter filed an emergency motion with the trial court on december     weeks after the preliminary injunction against john carroll in its motion and supporting brief the plaintiff alleged that within three days of the issuance of the preliminary injunction the defendants had put a secret scheme into operation to circumvent and violate the terms of the preliminary injunction pursuant to this alleged scheme lawter charged that carroll scientific had commenced operation as a business entity with the purpose of soliciting and selling competing products to dyall customers and that james carroll had agreed to purchase john carrolls entire interest in carroll scientific by way of an installment purchase plan under this installment plan james carroll had already issued certain  promissory notes to john carroll according to lawter by virtue of this scheme the defendants were able to completely shift john carrolls interest in carroll scientific to james carroll and to begin to employ john carrolls assets to compete with lawter in direct violation and evasion of the trial courts preliminary injunction order in its prayer for relief lawter requested the court to issue four separate orders  an order compelling john carroll to comply fully with the november   order  an order enjoining james carroll and carroll scientific from soliciting longterm existing customers of lawter until such time as the court deems appropriate to insure that the equity intended by the order of november   is accomplished  an order specifically including carroll scientific inc within the reach of the november   order and  an order enjoining james carroll from using lawters alleged confidential business information similar to the injunction the trial court had entered against john carroll on december   the trial court heard oral arguments on this emergency motion two discovery depositions both dated december   were placed in evidence in one of these depositions john carroll admitted that he had signed a purchase agreement with his brother james on november  under this agreement john sold james his entire interest in carroll scientific the purpose of the transaction according to john was to conform to the requirements of the preliminary injunction by eliminating his involvement with carroll scientific john also stipulated that carroll scientific was a business entity which has or intends to solicit longterm existing customers of lawter    for the purpose of selling them    competitive    products in the other discovery deposition james carroll admitted that he had purchased his brothers interest in carroll scientific on the advice of counsel james refused to answer questions relating to actions taken by carroll scientific since the issuance of the preliminary injunction on january  the trial court issued the order partially quoted and partially summarized below  the court reiterates its intentions expressed in its temporary restraining order extended on march   and its preliminary injunction entered on november   to preserve the status quo  the court reiterates its intention expressed in its preliminary injunction to dissolve its temporary restraining order as to james a carroll and richard m bradley   carroll scientific inc remains and is bound by the terms of this courts order  john r carroll and carroll scientific inc as well as their employees agents representatives and any and all persons acting in concert with them shall place themselves immediately in full compliance with this courts orders  the defendants john r carroll and carroll scientific inc shall take no further actions except to appeal from any order to alter the status quo under which this court intended to preserve by its orders until a trial can be held on the merits of this case carroll scientific then appealed this january  ruling and the pending appeals were consolidated    the first issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in entering a preliminary injunction against john carroll although john carroll claims that a noncompetition covenant contained in an employment agreement is per se unenforceable because it has no geographical limitation see parish v schwartz   ill   ne  we believe that under current illinois law the question of the geographical scope of a covenant not to compete is only one of the factors to be considered by a court in determining a covenants enforceability and not the final test this factor may be relatively insignificant as in cases where there are special circumstances such as customer lists customer contacts trade secrets or other confidential information to be protected see in re solar textiles co v fortino   ill app d   ned  smithereen co v renfroe   ill app   ned  or the lack of geographical scope may be determinative as in situations where territorial restrictions as to salesmen or routemen are greater than the area that was served by these employees on behalf of the former employer in this latter situation the cases almost uniformly hold that excluding service occupations from an entire state by such a covenant is unreasonable the rationale behind making geography determinative in this situation is that the employee should be excluded only from territory in which as a result of his employment he was able to establish a certain relationship with the employers customers central keystone plating of illinois inc v hutchison   ill app d   ned  the rationale behind making geography a less significant factor in the case where special circumstances exist is that the restraints should be commensurate with the need to protect the employer the employer is entitled to have his interest in his trade secrets protected such as secret processes of manufacture which may  be of vast value and that protection may be secured by restraining the employee from divulging these secrets or putting them to his own use the employer is also entitled not to have his old customers by solicitation or such other means enticed away from him brunner  lay inc v chapin   ill app d   ned  rhoades v clifton gunderson  co   ill app d   ned  we believe that under the above analysis geography is only one of the factors to be considered in the enforceability of an employment agreement whether a simple employment agreement is involved or an agreement ancillary to the sale of a business therefore it is the function of the court to put the appropriate emphasis on this factor and consider it along with other factors in its ultimate determination as to whether to enforce an employment agreement   under the instant facts the plaintiff alleged and presented evidence to the trial court to prove special circumstances in the creation and prospective enforcement of this employment agreement lawter alleged that john carroll had in his possession certain trade secrets and customer lists which were its proprietary business information and that john carroll was about to use this information to compete with the plaintiff contrary to his employment agreement on the basis of these facts we do not believe that the trial court erred when it determined that this noncompetition clause without a geographical limitation was valid because the restraint was not greater than necessary to protect the employer rhoades v clifton gunderson  co   ill app d   ned  john carroll next argues that even if the noncompetition covenant is not unreasonable per se because it lacks geographical limitations it cannot be enforced against him because he did not fully participate in negotiating the agreement because the agreement did not survive the sale to lawter because the agreement did not survive his promotion to lawters national sales manager because it is unreasonable as to geography and time because no trade secrets are involved because customer information is not a protectable interest and because the court did not enforce the noncompetition and trade secrets covenants as written but impermissibly modified them in addition to the above claims based on the defendants perceived nonenforceability of the employment agreement john carroll also makes claims that the evidence did not support the conclusion that lawter would suffer irreparable injury that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the court properly balanced the equities in this case and that the evidence did not support the courts rejection of  john carrolls unclean hands defense in order to respond to carrolls arguments it is necessary to keep sight of the purpose of a preliminary injunction the necessary showing to obtain a preliminary injunction and the function of the trial court in issuing a preliminary injunction   the function of the trial court in considering a motion for a preliminary injunction is to grant the injunction if it finds  that there is a certain and clearly ascertainable right that needs protection  that the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted  there is no adequate remedy at law and  the movant has a likelihood of success on the merits these factors must be established by a preponderance of the evidence baal v mcdonalds corp   ill app d   ned  the trial court has a great deal of discretion in granting or denying an injunction a reviewing court will only reverse the trial court if it finds that the granting or denial of the preliminary injunction was against the manifest weight of the evidence booth v greber   ill app d   ned    to prevail in its action for a preliminary injunction it was necessary for lawter to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits simpkins v maras   ill app d   ned  lawter was not required to make out a case which in all events would warrant relief at the final hearing lawter needed only to raise a fair question as to the existence of its right to its claim and lead the trial court to believe that it would probably be entitled to such relief if its proof should ultimately sustain its allegations wessel co v busa   ill app d   ned  based on the voluminous record in this case we believe that lawter was able to raise a fair question as to the validity of the employment agreement and its right to have the agreement enforced against john carroll more specifically we believe the court could reasonably conclude contrary to john carrolls contentions that john carroll had intended to sign a legally valid document whether or not he had fully participated in its negotiation that john carroll had intended to have the agreement survive the sale of dyall to lawter because he wrote a letter to dyall on the date of the sale which apparently reaffirmed the existence of the employment agreement and that the noncompetition covenant in the agreement survived carrolls promotion to lawters national sales manager because he continued to work for the same organization and thus this was not a termination of his employment hereunder by the company as carroll claims   we also believe that the trial court could reasonably conclude  that the employment agreement should be enforced against john carroll the language of the agreement carves out lawters line of business for protection as well as lawters business secrets we believe that the trial court was reasonably trying to protect these areas and did not engage in impermissible modification of these terms when it concluded that lawters long term near permanent customer lists warranted protection under this language as well as its other confidential business information we find no merit in john carrolls argument that lawter had no confidential business information to protect because it was not lawters practice to mark its documents confidential or keep them under lock and key the absence of such precautions did not give carroll license to unilaterally remove such documents from the premises of his former employer nor do we find john carrolls argument as to the unreasonableness of the geographic and time terms in the agreement convincing as we understand it carrolls argument here is that the time term is unreasonable because there was a fiveyear time limit to the agreement if he resigned the minute he signed the document and a more indefinite three years after termination of employment if he chose to stay with the company john carroll also states that his former employer who also signed such an agreement at the sale of dyall had the advantage of the fiveyear term because he resigned immediately since john carroll had control over this commitment and opted for the threeyear term when he decided to stay with lawter and also because the longer he stayed the greater his knowledge of lawters intimate business information became we do not believe that under the facts in this record john carroll made a sufficient showing before the trial court that the time term should not be enforced against him as for the reasonableness of the geographic term geography is relevant only to line of business and is appropriate under these facts   we also disagree with john carrolls contention that the trial court erred when it concluded that the evidence showed irreparable injury to lawter if a preliminary injunction were not issued john carroll claims that the trial courts finding of irreparable injury is clearly erroneous because longstanding customer relationships are protected only if they are exclusive because there was no evidence in the record that lawter had near permanent exclusive relationships with any of his customers because the relative financial position of the parties made irreparable injury to lawter most unlikely and because lawter had already realized almost   times its initial investment in dyall we fail to see how these assertions on the part of john carroll  compel the conclusion that the trial court erred when it held that lawter would suffer irreparable injury in its original complaint the plaintiff alleged that it would suffer irreparable injury unless the defendants were restrained from using lawters confidential and proprietary business information from establishing their planned rival business in competition with lawter from exploiting prior breaches of contract and of loyalty to lawter with respect to customers and employees from using lawters confidential business information to injure lawter in its business and property from depriving lawter of the good will which it had purchased with dyall and from generally causing injury to lawter for which there was no adequate remedy at law under illinois case law an alleged injury is defined as irreparable in a variety of circumstances the injury has been defined as irreparable when the injured party cannot be adequately compensated in damages when the damages cannot be measured by any certain pecuniary standards when the injury could possibly be compensated for in damages but the injury is of that species which ought not to be submitted to on one hand or inflicted on the other hand or when the plaintiff will be subject to transgressions of a continuing nature constant and frequent such that no meaningful redress can be had at law cross wood products inc v suter   ill app d   ned  simpkins v maras   ill app d   ned  bally manufacturing corp v jsa group inc   ill app d   ned  we believe that under the facts in this case where the defendant was about to use the plaintiffs own confidential information customer lists and formula to go into business and compete with the plaintiff it was reasonable for the court to conclude that lawter had made an adequate showing of irreparable injury under many of the above circumstances more particularly we believe that the factual situation present here gives rise to the conclusion that the plaintiff will be subject to transgressions of a continuing nature constant and frequent such that no meaningful redress can be had at law bally manufacturing corp v jsa group inc   ill app d   ned  carrolls two remaining arguments as to why the trial court erred in issuing a preliminary injunction against him involve his claim that the court failed to properly balance the equities in this case and his claim that the courts conclusion that his unclean hands defense was at this point and time irrelevant in regard to the balancing of equities claim the court found that the doctrine of the balancing of equities  was inapplicable here because the existence of a private right and its violation is clear since carroll cites us to no authority to indicate why this conclusion is erroneous as a matter of law we shall only address ourselves to john carrolls claim that it is erroneous as a matter of fact according to john carroll far more damage will be done to him by depriving him of his means of a livelihood than will be done to lawter if he is allowed to compete with lawter until a trial on the merits in this case we believe that it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that in the light of the existence of a valid employment agreement and an adequate showing of irreparable injury it was unnecessary to begin to balance the equities in regard to john carrolls unclean hands defense john carroll bases this claim on the fact that the former owner of dyall had allegedly signed a consulting agreement with lawter and that lawter at some point had told john carroll that such an agreement had not been executed the trial court held that this fact had no bearing on the issues in this particular case at this particular time we also fail to see how this consulting agreement is relevant here having decided that the trial court did not err in issuing preliminary injunctive relief against john carroll we shall now consider the second broad issue raised by the parties in this appeal the issue involves lawters contention on its crossappeal that the trial court erred in failing to extend preliminary injunctive relief to include james carroll and richard bradley in its brief lawter summarizes its argument on this point by stating that it should have been clear to the trial court that all of the defendants have played key roles in a conspiracy to assist john carroll to breach his employment agreement and use lawters confidential formulae manufacturing processes costs prices marketing and customer requirements data to compete against lawter all in violation of their fiduciary responsibilities to lawter therefore in dissolving the temporary restraining order as to james carroll and richard bradley and then failing to include them in his preliminary injunction order against john carroll the trial court left them free to continue the conspiracy to aid and abet john carroll to breach his contractual obligations and to misuse lawterdyall confidential proprietary business information furthermore according to lawter john carroll was then afforded the ability to accomplish through his fellow conspirators what the trial court had enjoined him from doing directly in regard to james carroll and richard bradley the trial court found that the evidence did not support the conclusion that they had conspired with john carroll to breach his employment agreement  that they had breached their independent fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff or that they had misappropriated documents containing the plaintiffs confidential business information the court also concluded that judicial protection should not be extended to lawter on their behalf for a period beyond the time required for reverse engineering which had already passed   all of the issues raised by lawter in this crossappeal are questions of fact concerning the activities of bradley and james carroll we have already stated that a reviewing court will only reverse the trial court on factual matters if it finds that the granting of the preliminary injunction was against the manifest weight of the evidence la salle national bank v triumvera homeowners association   ill app d   ned  furthermore there is a strong presumption in favor of the findings of the trial court which has heard the testimony of witnesses observed their demeanor considered the documentary evidence and the pleadings and has heard the oral arguments of counsel marth v illinois weatherseal inc   ill app d   ned     in reviewing the record we do not believe that evidence before the court supports the conclusion that lawter had made an adequate showing of likelihood of success on the merits in its claims that the activities of james carroll and bradley rise to the level of a conspiracy to breach john carrolls employment agreement of a breach of their own independent fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff or of a misappropriation of documents which after the passage of time and the return of the documents still warranted legal redress with regard to bradley the evidence established that he did not participate in misappropriating any confidential documents of the plaintiff and that he did not perform any activity on behalf of carroll scientific prior to his resignation from lawter with regard to james carroll the evidence supported the conclusion that he had not induced bradley to leave lawter and that the culpability accruing to his participation with john carroll in misappropriating certain documents had been cured by return of the documents and by the passage of time necessary for reverse engineering other activities on the part of james carroll such as obtaining financing for carroll scientific designing a production plant purchasing equipment and supplies are more reasonably classified as preliminary competitive activities rather than activities in breach of a fiduciary duty to his employer it is recognized that an employee absent a restrictive contractual provision has a right to enter into competition with the former employer upon leaving such employ cross woods products v suter   ill app d    ned  indeed an employee may legitimately go so far as to form a rival corporation and outfit it for business while still employed by the prospective competitor see james c wilborn  sons inc v heniff   ill app d   ned  an employee is held accountable for breaching his fiduciary duty to his employer only when he goes beyond such preliminary competitive activities and commences business as a rival concern while still employed cross woods products v suter   ill app d   ned  since all the parties are in agreement that carroll scientific did not commence operation as a business entity with the purpose of soliciting and selling competing products to dyall customers until after the preliminary injunction against john carroll was in place almost nine months after james carroll and bradley had resigned from lawter we believe that the trial court could correctly characterize these activities as preliminary competitive activities the final issue on appeal involves injunctive relief against carroll scientific lawter contends that the temporary restraining order entered on march   against carroll scientific survived the november   preliminary injunction even though carroll scientific was not preliminarily enjoined in the order alternatively lawter argues that the court erred in not preliminarily enjoining carroll scientific in the november  order and further that the preliminary injunction entered on january   against carroll scientific was appropriate carroll scientific responds that the temporary restraining order had expired on november  and that there was insufficient evidence to enter a preliminary injunction against carroll scientific on that date carroll scientific further claims that the court had no jurisdiction to enter the january  order because lawter had filed a notice of crossappeal against carroll scientific because it had not been preliminarily enjoined on november  additionally carroll scientific contends that if the court did in fact have jurisdiction subsequent to november  there was insufficient evidence before the court upon which to base injunctive relief    as to the temporary restraining order it is the law of this case that the temporary restraining order entered on march   and extended on march   expired on november   with the issuance of the preliminary injunction this courts prior ruling in lawter international inc v carroll   ill app d    ned   explains that the purpose of a restraining order is to maintain the status quo until both parties can appear before the court and present evidence on the preliminary  injunction emphasis added various authorities have considered the question of when a temporary restraining order terminates  amjurd injunctions sec   provides when a determination of the propriety of granting the preliminary injunction has been made the whole force of the restraining order ceases by its own limitations  cjs injunctions sec   states the force of the restraining order ceases on hearing of the application for a temporary injunction or on the granting or refusal of the injunction without any express order to that effect where a restraining order has terminated as a matter of law the belief of the parties and the judge to the contrary will not change it based upon these authorities we conclude that the trial court was in error when it declared that carroll scientific inc remains and is bound by the temporary restraining order as a matter of law a temporary restraining order does not survive the issuance of a preliminary injunction thus the temporary restraining order against carroll scientific ceased at the point in time that the order on the preliminary injunction was issued against john carroll and carroll scientific was not enjoined   regardless of whether the trial court retained jurisdiction to enter a subsequent preliminary injunction against carroll scientific we believe that there was insufficient evidence to enjoin carroll scientific in the november  order and that there was insufficient evidence upon which to grant preliminary injunctive relief against carroll scientific on january  lawter alleged that carroll scientific along with james carroll and richard bradley was part of a conspiracy to violate the covenants of john carrolls employment agreement with lawter as of november  the trial court found insufficient evidence of such a conspiracy the court specifically found that neither james carroll nor bradley had breached their independent fiduciary obligations to lawter that bradley james carroll and carroll scientific had no independent responsibilities to lawter under john carrolls employment agreement that james carroll and bradley had not misappropriated documents containing lawters confidential business information and that judicial protection should not be extended to lawter for a period beyond the time required for reverse engineering which had already passed thus under the november order james carroll and carroll scientific were free to go into business against lawter the only new evidence before the court subsequent to the november  order was that john carroll had sold his interest in carroll scientific to his brother james carroll john carroll divested himself of all ownership of carroll scientifics stock and ceased participating in  its activities by such actions carroll scientific claims that john carroll was merely trying to comply with the terms of the november  order since lawter was unable to present any new evidence concerning a conspiracy other than depositions which only testified to the completion of the sale we believe that there was insufficient evidence to support the courts conclusion that carroll scientific should be enjoined on january  for the above reasons we affirm the order of november  and reverse the order of january
