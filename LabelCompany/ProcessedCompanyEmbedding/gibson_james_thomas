  john then married joanna prentice widow of henry prentice on july   after her family experienced similar family problems obviously and extremely stressful period for her and the entire family

war raised five children and experienced some legal problems it was very uncommon to have negative ancestral information published a reader would have to read between the lines to find out what actually occurred genealogist frederick clifton pierce esq politely discussed witchcraft when in  he published the gibson family of cambridge cited on page  due to the rebecca gibson witchcraft fiasco certainly no eligible man widowed or single would consider sisterinlaw rebecca errington gibson for a wifejohn gibson jr  was born in cambridge middlesex massachusetts the oldest son and fourth child

taken from her and placed with suitable church families rebecca was then put out by the selectman to families in the country obviously an extremely difficult time for her with no record of her death

concord and  joseph knight of woburn massachusetts  ref mary gibson  was raised with the family of stephen gates of stow massachusetts and married his son nathaniel gates  on oct   ref john gibson iii  it would appear that young john obviously intelligent and well educated had a different view on life and was apparently quite unhappy with his life in cambridge under a bad influence he was excommunicated for his radical views this was not a good time to be a quaker in the massachusetts bay colonies similar incidents a few years earlier resulted in a swift execution the church elders then attempted to erase any and all records of his existence timothy gibson  grew up with the family of stephen gates of stow massachusetts he was well educated became a church deacon and married

jeopardy star hutton gibson and his famous sons actors donal and mel gibson hollywood producer and director mel gibson is very aware of our family history obviously some of the gibson family members were very independent in their thinking and not active members of the cambridge community or the established church contrary to popular belief the massachusetts bay colonies were not founded on religious freedom a few years earlier many quakers were executed for their belief i tkg  have been searching for more than thirty years for information on the halsall halsell or hulsell quakers who was this group that existed about  years agojohn gibson iii  philadelphiapa maybe see notes below fourth child and oldest son of john jr he was an early colonial philadelphia resident and friend of

president of the united states in congress assembled when the united states constitution was enacted john espoused the cause of the halsall quakers and with community antagonism toward his religion

with two serving terms as york city mayornote the ancestors of these children are not confirmed there is another ancestry possible for robert and moses  see footnote below  as well as another ancestry mentioned above for george also note that thomas knowlton gibsons research does not delve into the descendants of robert gibson b moses gibson is an unusual name and the fact that robert names a son moses and moves to bucks where his brothers wife is from seems to confirm a relationship between moses and robert  whether they are related to george and william and the women rebecca mary and anne is

independence july   articles of confederation nov   in york pa and finally the constitution of the united states  as mentioned above this information came directy from thomas gibsons website httpwwwshoholacomgibson  welcome to the thomas knowlton gibson genealogy page his information is largely from �biographical history of york county illustrated � by john gibson historical editor a descendant of john iii thomas knowlton gibson confirmed that the above link to the boston gibsons was made due to excommunication records in massachusetts and the concurrent appearance of a john gibson in philadelphia  and the fact that the excommunication was due to quaker beliefs and the philadelphia john gibson was quaker plus william penns philadelphia would have been the place to go for a quaker at that time however there are also records of a second ancestry the above ancestry is scottish the second ancestry is british having lived temporarily in ireland prior to immigration to americain the pennsylvania archives there are mentions of a william gibson  eastonlancashireengland londonengland married to elizabeth thompson haberdasher of london who became a quaker friend of william penn and received land grants from him william is the father of at least three children william john and patience and perhaps also rebecca hannah and elizabeth although only two children were named in his will  see below patience married john wright and died in chesterpa on   they had received land in buckspa and moved there circa  before penn left for america in august  a significant alteration took place in the composition of the east jersey proprietorship the twelve associates agreed to take in three persons more to make up the number of proprietors to twentyfour this was accomplished by each owner transferring half his share to a new proprietor since wilcox had sold his share there were eleven old proprietors and thirteen new proprietors the new proprietors consisted of five london men all quakers two dublin men both quakers six scots three of who were quakersthe london men were edward byllynge gentleman and brewer of westminster and chief proprietor of west jersey now solvent again william gibson citizen and haberdasher and a prominent quaker minister thomas barker merchant gawan lawrie merchant and james brain soninlaw of groom and a merchant william gibson was a noted london quaker who was many times imprisoned fined and distrained of his goods his name appears with those of penn whitehead barclay and others as a signer of epistles sent to the monthly meetingsgibson was not only one of the  proprietors but a first purchaser of land in pennsylvania with an interest of  acres he never came to america but did attend the proprietors meetings in london until his death in  his widow and two children were his heirs thomas boell their agent secured for them  acres at wickatunk and  acres on the millstone in  however the gibson propriety was purchased by robert west and thomas cox and in  cox as trustee for west sold it to dr daniel coxein march  when coxe sold his holdings to the west jersey society he owned two east jersey properties one he referred to as the west share and this was the share he had purchased from byllynge and later regain control of the other mews share he had purchased from the heirs of gibson since it was onehalf of gibsons original undivided propertyin the book entitled the short and itinerary journals of george fox macmillan  william gibson is noted as appearing frequently in the haistwell diary between the years  and william gibson whom i know well and who at the time of the civil wars being a soldier at carlisle he and three others having heard that a quaker meeting was appointed in that city they agreed to go thither and abuse the preacher whose name was thomas holmes but gibson who came to scoff remained to pray and became a zealous minister he resided in lancashire till about  when he removed to londonhe took a prominent part with fox and others in the wilkinsonstory controversy dealing especially with raunce and harris in  mo  he was reported nigh death penns letter to m fox it is said that more than a thousand friends followed his remains from lombard street to bunhill fields the history and genealogy of fenwicks colony by thomas shourds orig pub in  and since reprinted by genealogical publishing company is a sourcebook rich in info on nj quakers that may help with other lines although wm gibson is not identified in it beware that much of shourds data is questionable  pa archivesfurthermore genealogical information on the george gibson of lancaster also supports a more recent emigration and confirm a scotsirish tie it is my dlh  aim to discover more information about the robert gibson b and his brotherssisters to see if their records or biographies might help to pin down their ancestry however it should be noted that the robert gibson in buckspa in the ss is almost certain to be the son of robert gibson b in philadelphia and the newphew of moses gibson b in philadelphia jesse brittons wife ann born circa  is thought to likely be a granddaughter of george b or william bfrom thomas knowlton gibson you are correct about william gibson being an early resident of philadelphia but he was almost certainly not the father of john gibson born  who married anne st clair in philadelphia william was the son of john gibson b  who fled to galway ireland in  who was the son of william    a free baron and lord of session william was born in  emigrated to england from galway around  met george fox became a quaker he met and became a friend of william penn and then emigrated to the colonies through baltimore or new castle and then to philadelphia william certainly made significant contributions to the founding of pennsylvania both in london and in philadelphiai am very interested in any documentation indicating he is the father of john who married anne st clair in philadelphia in  as my great grandfathers records do not indicate any close relationship to william you are correct in that i do not have a documented relationship of john born in cambridge  and converting to quakerism to john gibson of philadelphia recorded as being a quaker and born in  since john of cambridge is recorded a moving to philadelphia around  and there were very few colonists named john gibson in philadelphia in  actually i can find only one i am reasonably certain they are one and the same person i suspect that john might have lived with his great uncle william upon arriving in philadelphia which might be the reason some record him as the son of william later updated uncle william  it seems that he probably did not emigrate but instead provided his land to his children it seems the early philadelphia gibson family lived in the bristol area misc gibson records ann hunt born  darby chester co pennsylvania married john blunston jr nathan gibson note john blunston jr died in  and ann married second to nathan gibson on dec   at darby mm  darby chester co pa there were several families of gibsons who settled in hopewell township john gibson died in the year  leaving a wife ann a daughter mary and a sister margaret robert gibson died in  james gibson of hopewell died in  leaving a son william grandson james beard john elliot probably married a daughter granddaughter margaret elliot a daughter married hugh thompson john elliot was an indian trader and traded amongst the tribes in northern ohio for robert callendar william gibson of newtown township died in  leaving children robert gibson john gibson samuel gibson james gibson george gibson gideon gibson charles gibson and ann gibson george gibson the father of judge gibson was the son of john gibson who kept tavern in lancaster when the town was laid out he married ann west the daughter of francis west the first magistrate of cumberland county at the commencement of the revolutionary war he and his brother john were trading among the indians along the the ohio at this time there was a very disorderly spirit among the settlers at the forks of the ohio which was fomented by dr john connolly and other emissaries of lord dunmore who claimed jurisdiction over that country and annexed it to augusta county virginia the virginians evidently enlisted their sympathies a number followed dunmore and were tinctured with toryism while others who espoused the patriot cause accepted commissions in the army from virginia and george gibson was one of the latter he afterwards served in the regular line he went to new orleans to procure powder etc for the continental army he was successful in his mission and negotiated with oliver pollock who transported the powder etc in vessels to one of the atlantic ports at the close of the war virginia gave colonel gibson a warrant for land in kentucky but when he came to locate it he found the land covered by a warrant of a previous date he applied to congress for relief and although general muhlenburg reported the bill favorably for some reason or other neither he nor his heirs received any recompense he commanded a company at st clairs defeat was mortally wounded and when the troops were put to flight and everyone was trying to save himself as his brotherinlaw jacob slough of lancaster passed by him he begged him to assist him off the field but slough ran on colonel gibson then placed his back against a tree and drew his pistols and sold his life dearly to the redskins his body was taken to fort washington and buried there he resided along shearmans creek at the foot of pisgah mountain the creek runs forty miles along the western base of the mountain with a meadow about five hundred feet wide and one thousand feet long between the creek and the dwelling an apple orchard covers a portion of this meadow upon its iste colonel gibson had a race course he owned a mill near his dwelling and several hundred acres of land which was mostly uncultivated what induced francis west to leae carlisle and settle at shearmans creek which at that time was cut off from other settlements by the mountains i cannot imagine chief justice gibson was born in this house a portion of it is now used as a pottery one of gibsons slaves wounded a buck and was killed by it where the lime kiln now is george gibson made his will november   leaving sons francis gibson george gibson john bannister gibson patrick henry gibson he devised something to william gibson who was a nephew of robert callendar mrs gibson belonged to the church of england and shw was very anxious to have her sons baptized by an episcopal minister she made known the fact to the minister probably in cumberland valley who came to shearmans valley and took up his quarters at mr gibsons who finally gave his consent to have the boys baptized but he very likely gave them a hint of the matter for as long as the minister was there they went to the mountains daily to hunt starting before daylight and did not return until the minister had retired for the night he finally gave up on them and returned to carlisle without accomplishing his mission source engles notes and queries volume ii pages information from cumberland pa historical society fromkaisaaolcom todhaysbcglobalnetdonnathe cumberland county historical society sent the gibson file the flower file graveyard info tax info and some other odd things from which ive figured out the following i think there were  gibson brothers john robert and james johns will was dated  proved  wife ann left bequest to wife sister mary sister margaret mcfarlin not in the us nephew mathias ferguson and daughter mary mary had guardians richard nicholas and allen leeper executors were robert gibson john mcclintock and hugh thompson roberts will was dated  proved  i think this is my robert his wife was ann he left bequest to ann sons andrew and robert my robert i hope daughters jean martha ann executors were william patton hugh thompson and andrew givan daughter ann was  in  when she chose george brown as her guardian james will was proved  wife was jean left bequest to wife son william soninlaws john elliott and hugh thompson his will was listed in  wifes name was mary granddaughter margaret elliott and grandson james beard these were all in hopewell township however in newton township there was a william gibson his will was proved  wife margaret son robert left him  acres bounded by james young and andrew gibson also made bequests to sons john william james george gideon charles and daughters janet and ann executors were wife margaret and allen leeper the flower genealogy definitely lists john and robert as brothers but the fact that hugh thompson married mary gibson daughter of james and was executor for robert leads me to believe james was also a brother or cousin and allen leeper turns up as guardian for johns daughter mary and executor for william gibson ann daughter of robert would have been born in  ann daughter of william would have been born closer to  because she was the last child listed and his will refers to another
