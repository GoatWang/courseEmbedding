prado is right where he wants to be the president of quaker foods america leads our lineup of boardroom elite “i like to say that my family was poor in money but rich in love” march   by tina vasquez as the eldest child growing up in a rough neighborhood in mexico city jose luis prado felt an intense drive to set a good example and be a positive role model he was the first in his family to graduate from college and he was valedictorian of his class breaking new ground and making his four siblings proud “for me it was all about finding a way to do well in school and create a different future for my family and me” prado says “i like to say that my family was poor in money but rich in love i never felt pressured i always felt encouragement and my family celebrated every milestone with me” it was through education that all good things would come in mexico prado met the woman who would become his wife and the mother of his children rosa elena with two sons in tow the prado family would hop scotch around the globe thanks to prado’s start with pepsico mexico foods nearly  years ago where he began in the company’s fritolay division in mexico city leaving engineering behind prado began his pepsico career in businessinformation solutions which provided him with opportunities to travel to europe and asia according to prado this was a period of great expansion initially the company was operating in just  countries today it’s in  prado says his time in mexico as an executive was a crucial step in his career and a transformative experience one that informed his leadership style greatly he went from leading small groups to being responsible for more than  people in sales “to be successful in the global market in different assignments and in different cultures you have to evolve and adapt as a leader” prado says “you have to think on your feet and change with the conditions as it’s required as an engineer i was really into details as i was given more responsibilities i had to move away from that i had to learn to focus on the bigger picture and learn to empower teams this was a crucial skill i learned the hard way it wasn’t something that came naturally to me” the mexico city native would go on to hold a number of key roles for pepsico including president of fritolay snacks in the caribbean president of pepsico snacks in argentina and uruguay and area president for the andean region and southern cone eventually becoming president of gamesaquaker in mexico before obtaining his current role as president of quaker foods north america based out of chicago when pepsico acquired quaker oats in  it required integrating the two iconic companies and developing a new line of quaker cookies prado says that in just three short years quaker’s line of snacks in mexico have become larger than its oatmeal business with quaker cookies now being sold in  countries “it’s a privilege to work with the most trusted brand in the country” prado says “quaker oats is  years old and it has such reach and impact the goal is to continue honoring our consumers and providing the same quality of product they’ve become accustomed to while transforming a brand that has become synonymous with oatmeal into one synonymous with oatbased meals we’re incorporating oats into new delicious products with powerful new technologies” pictured here jose luis prado better known as “quaker coach” stands with staff members at quaker food’s headquarters the impact of prado’s work and presence at pepsico can’t be overstated very few latinos reach such highranking levels prado says he “feels the importance” of being a latino in top roles at one of the country’s leading companies but what he thinks about the most is the meaning of his work with quaker “i’ve been given the opportunity to nourish and inspire healthy families by leveraging the power of quaker oats” prado says “we know how good oats are we know how good they are for families so our job is to get oats to people it’s simple if you think about it to offer the benefits of oats in nourishing delicious convenient ways providing good food to people is a powerful thing and i want that to be part of my legacy but there’s also the cultural aspect i’m the first mexican to run a major us division of pepsico pepsico is a pioneer in diversity and they have made it real the company isn’t just paying it lip service” part of prado’s legacy is the company’s performance with purpose programs aimed at nourishing healthy families one of these partnerships has quaker uniting with common threads an organization dedicated to educating children about the importance of nutrition and health by fostering an appreciation of cultural diversity through cooking both organizations are based in chicago and thus far quaker has funded  percent of the organization’s area classes aimed at making food fun educating students about health and nutrition and instilling healthy eating habits prado also believes serving on boards is an important aspect of his work and he serves on quite a few including ones for northern trust the chicago symphony orchestra genyouth the chicago council on global affairs and the hispanic association on corporate responsibility “as someone who has experienced a great deal of success i feel i have an obligation to my community to give back but serving on boards also provides pepsico with an opportunity” prado says “it’s a way of connecting to organizations and building a culture of commitment to the local community quaker has a passion for lending a hand to activities and programs that support youth and serving on boards is a direct link to these sustainable community programs” when pointing out to prado that much like his highranking positions within pepsico it’s also groundbreaking for a latino to serve on so many boards he his humble shrugging off his accomplishments less than  percent of corporate boards have latino representation on themprado says that for him the key was being a good leader first and foremost—a good leader who happened to be latino the president is adamant in his belief that if you bring value to your company you will get noticed neither in spite of nor because of your ethnicity “think of it this way the diversity is the icing on the cake it is not the cake” prado says “i grew up in mexico so the idea of ethnic diversity and inclusion wasn’t something we discussed often but i recognize the benefits being diverse is the ultimate competitive advantage it’s the only way to attract and retain the best talent and i’m so proud to work for a company that understands that in this issue bitten by the advocacy bug taking it personally david gomez’s year fight for the latino businessman financial
