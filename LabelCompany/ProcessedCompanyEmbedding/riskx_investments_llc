fluctuate in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer including general market economic and political conditions fixedincome securities risk fixedincome securities are subject to the risk of the issuers inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations ie credit risk and are subject to price volatility resulting from among other things interest rate sensitivity market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity ie market risk generally fixedincome securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and will increase in value if interest rates decline securities with longer durations are likely to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates generally making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations lower rated fixedincome securities have greater volatility because there is less certainty that principal and
