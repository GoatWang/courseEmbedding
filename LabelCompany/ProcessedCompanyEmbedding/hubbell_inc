incorporated was founded as a proprietorship in  by harvey hubbell ii born in connecticut in  he was a us inventor entrepreneur and industrialist his bestknown inventions are the us electrical plug and the pullchain light socket he is graduated from high school and began working for companies that manufactured marine engines and printing machinery during this time he accumulated several ideas for new inventions and in  he set out on his own opening a small manufacturing facility in bridgeport connecticut hubbells first product was taken from his own patent for a paper roll holder with a toothed blade for use in stores that sold wrapping paper this cutter stand became a tremendous success it was a common feature of retail stores that used wrapping paper in the early s and remained in wide use into the late th century soon he discovered that he had to design machinery to make its parts one of the first was a tapping machine also his patent around  with his business in machinery progressing hubbells next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than  he designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies patented machinery to slot screw heads a machine to assemble screws and small parts devised tools to indicate speed and patented a changeable speed screwdriver hubbells idea was to provide convenience safety and control to an electric light with his new pull socket which was patented in august  the same familiar device with its onoff pull chain is still in use today he built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity and one which could be connected or disconnected easily and safely to a power supply in the wall cartridge fuses and fuse block lamp holders key sockets  soon followed the same path later hubbells separable plug design took shape on the drawing board back in bridgeport and then submitted to the patent office in washington dc additional designs based on that basic concept  separable plugs in different configurations a single flush mounted receptacle  as well as new products for electrical circuits one of the most successful and the one most familiar today was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used in  hubbell published a page catalogue that listed  electrical products of his companys manufacture and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as harvey hubbell incorporated  in the same year the company registered its trademark of a sphere with meridian lines and the name hubbell centered within hubbells pace of new ideas and product design did not falter in  the company began constructing a fourfloor factory and office building that woul d become the first building in new england made of reinforced concrete between  and  he was granted  patents on a wide variety of electrical products companys product lines had been continuously expanded catalogue  was published in march   the catalogue had more than  pages and listed more than a thousand products in bulb sockets alone the company manufactured  different types and sizes hubbells toggle action light switch which incorporated a quick make or break feature to meet the rigid requirements of underwriters laboratories ul was replacing the former two button type push switch  hubbell designed a loxin mechanism which fit into any standard socket and locked the bulb in place falling lightbulbs no longer endangered streetcar passengers and overly thrifty commuters had to find a new source of replacement bulbs for home usefor the home the company developed a system for lighting fixture connections called elexit which allowed the homeowner to install most fixtures without hiring an electrician companys first era ended when its founder harvey hubbell ii died on december   he was succeeded as president of the company by his son harvey hubbell iii twentysix years old when he succeeded his father harvey hubbell iii had already spent years working in the business that early experience with electrical equipment engineering and learning the discipline of production was to stand the company in good stead in the decades to come harvey hubbell iii soon showed that he had inherited his fathers twin acumen for product innovation and business development in product innovation he devised the companys lines of twistlock industrial connectors with new and wire devices of various ratings designed a whole new series of locking connectors for industrial use which he named hubbellock and introduced heavyduty circuitbreaking devices the company played a large part in the war effort by meeting the demand for electrical components and systems to power the nations industries and by developing products for the special applications needed by military these included components for military vehicle electrical circuits batterycharging systems for m tanks power jacks for test meters vacuum tube sockets for radio communications and a line of electrical and electronic connectors for aircraft the companys years of experience in building devices reliable enough for industrial use was a valuable asset in the production of products which could perform under rugged battlefield conditions a second plant was opened in lexington kentucky in order to meet the demand and as a safety measure since the main plant in bridgeport was considered vulnerable to air or sea attack hubbell had been one of the first to manufacture flush toggle switches for alternating current only the first safety receptacle was designed and produced as
