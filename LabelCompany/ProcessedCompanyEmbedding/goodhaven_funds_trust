of the fund example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be goodhaven fund portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the above example affect the fund’s performance during the most recent fiscal year ended november   the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio goodhaven fund principal investment strategies under normal market conditions the fund’s investment advisor goodhaven capital management llc “goodhaven” or the “advisor” attempts to achieve the fund’s investment objective by investing primarily in a focused portfolio of equity securities when selecting such equity investments the advisor looks for certain attractive corporate characteristics such as relatively high free cash flow yields strong balance sheets products or services that satisfy basic human needs potential for longterm growth and managers that have demonstrated skill in capital allocation and who have a significant ownership interest although no particular characteristic is required for any specific investment from time to time the fund may also hold significant fixedincome investments or cash holdings the amount of such holdings will depend on the advisor’s assessment of the quantity and quality of investment opportunities that exist at any given time to help identify appropriate fixed income investments the advisor generally looks for security issuers that are the subject of adverse publicity or stressed industry conditions whose securities have declined in price despite reasonable future financial prospects as well as issuers undergoing reorganization or bankruptcy where outstanding fixedincome securities may ultimately receive cash new fixed income securities or an equity interest in a reorganized company in addition the advisor may purchase shortdated fixed income investments whose issuers are not stressed in lieu of holding large amounts of cash the proportion of the fund’s assets invested in each type of asset class will vary from time to time based upon the advisor’s assessment of the merits of specific security investments as well as general market and economic conditions although the fund’s focus is longterm the fund expects to shift from time to time among various asset classes and market sectors the fund may also invest in companies of any size market capitalization at any given time the fund may invest up to  of its assets in foreign securities and up to  of its net assets in emerging market securities the fund is nondiversified meaning that the fund will invest a greater percentage of its assets in significantly fewer securities than a diversified fund the equity securities in which the fund primarily invests include common and preferred stock including convertible preferred stock however the fund may also invest in equity securities such as partnership interests business trust shares interests in real estate investment trusts “reits” rights and warrants to subscribe for the purchase of equity securities and american depositary receipts “adrs” or similar securities the fixedincome securities in which the fund may invest include us corporate debt securities non us corporate debt securities bank debt including bank loans and participations municipal debt securities us government and agency debt securities shortterm debt obligations of foreign governments and foreign moneymarket instruments the fund typically invests in fixedincome securities to benefit from prevailing yields that the advisor’s fundamental research indicates are higher than warranted without focusing on the coupon duration or maturity of a particular issue or credit rating of that issuer the fund may also invest in “special situations” special situations occur when the securities of a company or other entity are expected to appreciate within a reasonable time due to entityspecific developments rather than general business conditions or movements of the market as a whole such developments and situations include but are not limited to liquidations mergers reorganizations management changes recapitalizations technological developments the advisor may sell a security for a variety of reasons including without limitation  a security subsequently fails to meet the advisor’s initial investment criteria  an issuerspecific event such as a proposed or completed acquisition or recapitalization changes the fundamental appeal of the company  upon analysis a new security is judged more attractive than a current holding  a change in view with respect to company industry or general market conditions or  the need to meet investor redemptions of fund shares goodhaven fund principal investment risks there is the risk that you could lose all or a portion of your investment in the fund the following risks could affect the value of your investment in the fund general market risk the market price of a security may fluctuate sometimes rapidly and unpredictably these fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than its cost when originally purchased or less than it was worth at an earlier time equity market risk common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in price interest rate risk the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates it is likely there will be less governmental action in the near future to maintain low interest rates the negative impact on fixed income securities from the resulting rate increases for that and other reasons could be swift and significant credit risk if issuers of fixed income securities in which the fund invests experience unanticipated financial problems their securities are likely to decline in value high yield securitiesjunk bond risk the value of fixed income securities held by the fund that are rated below investment grade are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default decreased liquidity of the security and changes in value based on public perception of the issuer municipal securities risk securities issued by governmental entities on behalf of political subdivisions agencies other municipal entities or private parties may decline as a result of a weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments under certain economic conditions or other circumstances moreover a change to the tax treatment of municipal securities under federal law could have an adverse impact on prices of these securities reit risk reits may be subject to certain risks associated with the direct ownership of real property

allocation and who have a significant ownership interest although no particular characteristic is required for any specific investment  from time to time the fund may also hold significant fixedincome investments or cash holdings  the amount of such holdings will depend on the advisor’s assessment of the quantity and quality of investment opportunities that exist at any given time     table of contents  prospectus    to help identify appropriate fixed income investments the advisor generally looks for security issuers that are the subject of adverse publicity or stressed industry conditions whose securities have declined in price despite reasonable future financial prospects as well as issuers undergoing reorganization or bankruptcy where outstanding fixedincome securities may ultimately receive cash new fixedincome securities or an equity interest in a reorganized company  in addition the advisor may purchase shortdated fixed income investments whose issuers are not stressed in lieu of holding large amounts of cash the proportion of the fund’s assets invested in each type of asset class will vary from time to time based upon the advisor’s assessment of the merits of specific security investments as well as general market and economic conditions  although the fund’s focus is longterm the fund expects to shift from time to time among various asset classes and market sectors  the fund may also invest in companies of any size market capitalization  at any given time the fund may invest up to  of its assets in foreign securities and up to  of its net assets in emerging market securities  the fund is nondiversified meaning that the fund will invest a greater percentage of its assets in significantly fewer securities than a diversified fund   the equity securities in which the fund primarily invests include common and preferred stock including convertible preferred stock  however the fund may also invest in equity securities such as partnership interests business trust shares interests in real estate investment trusts “reits” rights and warrants to subscribe for the purchase of equity securities and american depositary receipts “adrs” or similar securities  the fixedincome securities in which the fund may invest include us corporate debt securities nonus corporate debt securities bank debt including bank loans and participations municipal debt securities us government and agency debt securities shortterm debt obligations of foreign governments and foreign moneymarket instruments  the fund typically invests in fixedincome securities to benefit from prevailing yields that the advisor’s fundamental research indicates are higher than warranted without focusing on the coupon duration or maturity of a particular issue or credit rating of that issuer   the fund may also invest in “special situations”  special situations occur when the securities of a company or other entity are expected to appreciate within a reasonable time due to entityspecific developments rather than general business conditions or movements of the market as a whole  such developments and situations include but are not limited to ·   liquidations ·   mergers ·   reorganizations ·   management changes ·   recapitalizations ·   technological developments the advisor may sell a security for a variety of reasons including without

the fund’s investment objective strategies and risks investment objective   the fund seeks to achieve longterm growth of capital   the fund’s investment objective is nonfundamental which means it may be changed without shareholder vote upon at least  days’ written notice to fund shareholders  there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective principal investment strategies   under normal market conditions the advisor attempts to achieve the fund’s investment objective by investing primarily in a focused portfolio of equity securities  when choosing equity investments the advisor uses fundamental analysis to identify certain attractive characteristics of companies  such characteristics may include but are not limited to   ·   relatively high free cash flow yields   ·   strong balance sheets   ·   products or services that fill basic human needs or wants   ·   managers that have demonstrated skill in capital allocation   ·   managers who have a significant ownership interest   ·   participation in stressed industries   ·   potential for longterm growth   ·   significant tangible assets in relation to enterprise values and   ·   demonstrated ability to

necessary to maintain the business and its competitive position  from time to time the fund may also have significant fixedincome investments or cash holdings   the equity securities in which the fund primarily invests include common and preferred stock including convertible preferred stock  however the fund may invest in equity securities such as partnership interests business trust shares interests in reits rights and warrants to subscribe for the purchase of equity securities and adrs or similar securities   when choosing fixed income investments the advisor will generally look for security issuers that are the subject of adverse publicity or stressed industry conditions despite reasonable future financial prospects as well as issuers undergoing reorganization or bankruptcy where fixedincome securities may ultimately receive cash new fixedincome securities or an equity interest in a reorganized company  the advisor may also invest in fixedincome securities whose issuers

nonus corporate debt securities bank debt including bank loans and participations municipal debt securities us government and agency debt securities shortterm debt obligations of foreign governments

prospectus      the fund may also make investments in “special situations”  special situations occur when the securities of a company or other entity are expected to appreciate within a reasonable period of time due to entityspecific developments rather than general business conditions or movements of the market as a whole  such developments and situations include but are not limited to   ·   liquidations ·   mergers ·   reorganizations ·   management changes ·   recapitalizations ·   technological developments   investments in special situations may be in either equity securities or fixedincome securities such as corporate or municipal debt which may be in a distressed position as a result of economic or issuerspecific developments  fixedincome special situation investments may include high yield fixedincome securities otherwise known as “junk bonds”  ie  securities that are rated below investment grade by standard  poor’s ratings services “sp” or by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro” or similar unrated securities or municipal securities which may be rated below investment grade by sp or by another nrsro or unrated securities   the proportion of the fund’s assets invested in each type of asset class will vary from time to time based upon the advisor’s assessment of the merits of specific security investments as well as general market and economic conditions  although the fund’s focus is longterm and turnover is expected to be relatively low the fund expects to shift from time to time among various asset classes and market sectors  the fund may also invest in companies of any size market capitalization  at any given time the fund may invest up to  of its assets in foreign securities and up to  of its net assets in emerging market securities  the fund is “nondiversified” for purposes of the  act which means that the fund can invest a greater percentage of its assets in significantly fewer securities than a

holding  v iews change with respect to company industry or general market conditions or  the need to meet investor redemptions of fund shares    cash and cash equivalent holdings   although the fund will normally hold a focused portfolio composed primarily of equity and fixedincome securities the fund is not required to be fully invested in such securities and may maintain a significant portion of its total assets in cash and securities generally considered to be cash and cash equivalents including but not limited to  us government securities moneymarket funds bank deposits and other high quality money market instruments  cash and cash equivalents may also include foreign securities including but not limited to shortterm obligations of foreign governments or other high quality foreign moneymarket instruments  to the extent the fund invests in shortterm highquality debt obligations of foreign governments and other nonus issuers the securities of such foreign governments and other nonus issuers will generally have a maturity of one year or less and a credit rating of “a” or better by sp or a similar rating by another nrsro   the advisor believes that a certain amount of liquidity in the fund’s portfolio is desirable both to meet operating requirements and to take advantage of new investment opportunities  when the advisor is unable to find sufficient investments meeting its criteria cash and cash equivalents may comprise a significant percentage of the fund’s total assets  when the fund holds a significant portion of assets in cash and cash equivalents it may not meet its investment objective  the advisor further believes nevertheless cash and equivalent holdings are unlikely to result in absolute losses when measured over time may reduce volatility during periods of negative equity index returns and may be employed opportunistically during times of market stress to the fund’s longterm advantage     table of contents  prospectus    principal risks of investing in the fund the principal risks of investing in the fund that may adversely affect the fund’s net asset value “nav” or total return have previously been summarized in the “summary section”  these risks are discussed in more detail below general market risk   general market risk is the risk that the market price of a security may fluctuate sometimes rapidly and unpredictably  these fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than its cost when originally purchased or less than it was worth at an earlier time  general market risk may affect a single issuer industry sector of the economy or the market as a whole equity market risk   common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in price  various and unpredictable factors may affect equity prices including investor expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction and global or regional political economic and banking crises  common stockholders generally are exposed to greater risks as a consequence of having inferior rights to receive payments from issuers compared to the rights of preferred stockholders bondholders and other creditors of such issuers interest rate risk      bond prices generally rise when interest rates decline and decline when interest rates rise  the longer the duration of a bond the more a change in interest rates affects the bond’s price  shortterm and longterm interest rates may not move the same amount and may not move in the same direction  it is likely there will be less governmental action in the near future to maintain low interest rates or that governmental actions will be less effective in maintaining low interest rates  the negative impact on fixed income securities from the resulting rate increases for that and other reasons could be swift and significant including falling market values and reduced liquidity  substantial redemptions from bond and other income funds may worsen that impact  other types of securities also may be adversely affected from an increase in interest rates credit risk   to the extent the fund owns fixed income securities whose prices decline as a consequence of issuers experiencing unanticipated financial problems the value of the fund may decline  in addition the fund is subject to the risk that the issuer of a fixed income security will fail to make timely payments of interest or principal or may stop making such payments altogether high yield securitiesjunk bond risk   fixed income securities receiving below investment grade ratings may have speculative characteristics and compared to higherrated securities may have a weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments under certain economic conditions or other circumstances  high yield highrisk and lowerrated securities are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default decreased liquidity and fluctuations in value due to public perception of the issuer of such securities  these securities are often uncollateralized and subordinate to other debt that an issuer may have outstanding municipal securities risk   securities that are the obligations of or which have been issued by governmental entities on behalf of political subdivisions agencies other municipal entities or private parties may have a weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments under certain economic conditions or other circumstances  under such conditions or circumstances an issuer may be unable to pay for items such as highways water treatment plants sports stadiums racetracks parking facilities or parks for instance due to reduced tax or other revenues  moreover a change to the tax treatment of municipal securities under federal law could have an adverse impact on prices of these securities     table of contents  prospectus    reit risk   the fund may invest in reits including equity reits and mortgage reits  equity reits invest directly in real property while mortgage reits invest in mortgages on real property  reits may be subject to certain risks associated with the direct ownership of real property including declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and local economic conditions overbuilding and increased competition increases in property taxes and operating expenses and variations in rental income  reits are dependent upon management skills are not diversified are subject to heavy cash flow dependency default by borrowers and selfliquidation and must satisfy numerous regulatory requirements under the tax laws  reits especially mortgage reits are also subject to interest rate risks  when interest rates decline the value of a reit’s investment in fixedrate obligations can be expected to rise  conversely when interest rates rise the value of a reit’s investment in fixedrate obligations can be expected to decline  mortgage reits may be affected by the quality of any credit extended to them small and mediumsized companies risk   the fund may invest directly or indirectly in small and mediumsized companies  investing in securities of small and mediumsized companies even indirectly may involve greater risk than investing in larger and more established companies because shares of smaller companies usually have limited market liquidity which can result in more abrupt or erratic share price changes  these factors may lead to greater fluctuation in the price of the fund’s shares when compared to funds that invest exclusively in largecapitalization companies foreign securities and emerging markets risk   foreign securities involve risks relating to adverse political social and economic developments abroad  foreign companies may not be subject to accounting standards or governmental supervision comparable to us companies and there may be less public information about their operations  foreign markets may also be less liquid and more volatile than us markets  rapid increases in money supply may result in speculative investing contributing to volatility  foreign markets may offer less legal protection to investors  enforcing legal rights may be difficult costly and slow  there may be special problems enforcing claims against foreign governments  emerging market countries entail greater investment risk than developed markets  such risks could include government dependence on a few industries or resources governmentimposed taxes on foreign investment or limits on the removal of capital from a country unstable government and volatile markets currency risk   most foreign stocks are denominated in the currency of the country where they are traded  the fund’s nav per share is denominated in us dollars  the exchange rate between the us dollar and most foreign currencies fluctuates therefore the nav of the fund will be affected by a change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the currencies in which the fund’s stocks are denominated  the fund may also incur transaction costs associated with exchanging foreign currencies into us dollars or hedging such exposures bank debt risk   the fund may invest in bank debt which includes interests in loans to companies or their affiliates undertaken for various purposes  these loans which may bear fixed or floating rates have generally been arranged through private negotiations between a company and one or more financial institutions including banks  the fund’s investment may be in the form of participation in loans or of assignments of all or a portion of loans from third parties  investments in bank debt involve credit risk interest rate risk liquidity risk and other risks including the risk that any loan collateral may become impaired or that the fund may obtain less than the full value for the loan interests when sold special situations risk   investments in special situations may involve greater risks when compared to the fund’s other strategies due to a variety of factors  mergers reorganizations liquidations or recapitalizations may not be completed on the terms originally contemplated or may fail  expected developments may not occur in a timely manner or at all  transactions may take longer than originally anticipated resulting in lower annualized returns than contemplated at the time of investment  furthermore failure to anticipate changes in the circumstances affecting these types of investments may result in permanent loss of capital where the fund may be unable to recoup some or all of its investment     table of contents  prospectus    nondiversification risk   the fund attempts to invest in a limited number of securities  accordingly the fund may have more volatility and is considered to have more risk than a fund that invests in a greater number of securities because changes in the value of a single security may have a more significant effect either negative or positive on the fund’s nav  to the extent that the fund invests its assets in fewer securities the fund is subject to greater risk of loss if any of those securities become permanently impaired because the fund is “nondiversified” for purposes of the  act it may also have a greater percentage of its assets invested in particular industries than a diversified fund exposing the fund to the risk of unanticipated industry conditions as well as risks particular to a single company or the securities of a single company  additionally the nav of a nondiversified fund generally is more volatile and a shareholder may have a greater risk of loss if he or she redeems during a period of high volatility  lack of broad diversification also may cause the fund to be more susceptible to economic political regulatory liquidity or other events than a diversified fund management risk   management risk describes the fund’s ability to meet its investment objective based on the advisor’s success or failure at implementing investment strategies for the fund  the value of your investment is subject to the effectiveness of the advisor’s research analysis and asset

fair value determinations may be made as described below under procedures as adopted by the board fair value pricing under certain circumstances and in accordance with policies and procedures approved

fair valuation techniques may differ from the price quoted or published by other sources and may not accurately reflect the market value of the security when trading resumes  if a reliable market

period” specified in your state’s abandoned property laws tools to combat frequent transactions the board has adopted a policy to combat excessive trading  the fund discourages excessive shortterm trading and other potentially abusive trading practices and the fund may use a variety of techniques to detect and discourage such practices  these steps may include among other things monitoring trading activity imposing redemption fees and using fair value pricing under procedures adopted by the board when the advisor determines that current market prices are not readily available  as approved by the board these techniques may change from time to time as determined by the fund in its sole discretion in an effort to minimize any potential harm of excessive trading practices to the fund and its shareholders the fund reserves the right in its sole discretion to reject any purchase order in whole or in part for any reason including without limitation purchases by persons whose trading activity in fund’s shares is believed by the advisor to be harmful to the fund and without prior notice  the fund may decide to restrict purchase and sale activity in its shares based on various factors including whether frequent purchase and sale activity will disrupt portfolio management strategies and adversely affect the fund’s performance  although these efforts are designed to discourage abusive trading practices these tools cannot eliminate the possibility that such activity will occur  the fund seeks to exercise its judgment in implementing these tools to the best of its ability in a manner that it believes is consistent with the interests of its shareholders  except as noted in the prospectus the fund applies all restrictions uniformly in all applicable cases due to the complexity and subjectivity involved in identifying excessive trading activity and the volume of shareholder transactions the fund handles there can be no assurance that the fund’s efforts will identify all trades or trading practices that may be considered abusive  in particular since the fund receives purchase and sale orders through financial intermediaries that use group or omnibus accounts the fund cannot always detect frequent trading  however the fund will work with financial intermediaries as necessary to discourage shareholders from engaging in abusive trading practices and to impose restrictions on excessive trades  in this regard the fund has entered into information sharing agreements with financial intermediaries pursuant to which these intermediaries are required to provide to the fund at the fund’s request certain information relating to their customers investing in the fund through nondisclosed or omnibus accounts  the fund will use this information to attempt to identify abusive trading practices  financial intermediaries are contractually required to follow any instructions from the fund to restrict or prohibit future purchases from shareholders that are found to have engaged in abusive trading in violation of the fund’s policies  however the fund cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information provided to it from financial intermediaries and cannot ensure that it will always be able to detect abusive trading practices that occur through nondisclosed and omnibus accounts  as a consequence the fund’s ability to monitor and discourage abusive trading practices in omnibus accounts may be limited     table of contents  prospectus    service fees the advisor out of its own resources and without additional cost to the fund or its shareholders may in its sole discretion provide additional cash payments or noncash compensation to intermediaries who sell shares of the fund including affiliates of the advisor  these additional payments would be generally made to intermediaries that provide shareholder servicing or other administrative services to the fund  cash compensation may also be paid to intermediaries for inclusion of the fund on a platform or as an expense reimbursement in cases where the intermediary provides shareholder services to the fund’s shareholders however nothing in this section shall obligate the advisor to enter into any such agreements dividends and distributions the fund will make distributions of dividends and capital gains if any at least annually  the fund will make a distribution of any undistributed capital gains earned annually  the fund may make an additional payment of dividends or other distributions if it deems it to be desirable or necessary at other times during any year all distributions will be reinvested in shares of the fund unless you choose to have dividends or capital gains or both paid in cash  if you wish to change your distribution option call or write to the transfer agent in advance of the payment date for the distribution  if you elect to receive distributions andor capital gains paid in cash and the us postal service cannot deliver your check or if a check remains uncashed for six months the fund reserves the right to reinvest the distribution check in your account at the fund’s then current nav and to reinvest all subsequent distributions  generally

gains  in general fund distributions are taxable to you unless your investment is through a qualified retirement plan as either ordinary income or capital gain depending on the source of the fund’s income  fund distributions of its shortterm capital gains are taxable to you as ordinary income  fund distributions of its longterm capital gains are generally taxable to you as longterm capital gains  the rate you pay on capital gains distributions from the fund will depend on how long the fund held the securities that generated the gains not how long you owned your fund shares and there is no requirement that the fund take into consideration any tax implications when implementing its investment strategy  a portion of the ordinary income dividends paid to you by the fund may constitute qualified dividends eligible for taxation at longterm capital gain rates  you will be taxed in the same manner whether you receive your dividends and capital gain distributions in cash or reinvest them in additional fund shares  qualified dividend income the amount of which will be reported to you by the fund is currently taxed at a maximum federal rate of   lower rates apply for taxpayers in the lower income tax brackets  shareholders should note that the fund may make taxable distributions of income and capital gains even when share values have declined  an additional medicare

october november or december but paid in january   to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month are taxable as if they were paid in december  it is the general policy of the fund to declare distributions if any in december with a payment date later in the same month all distributions generally reduce the nav of the fund’s shares by the amount of the distribution  if you purchase shares prior to a distribution the distribution will be taxable to you even though economically it may represent a return on your investment if you sell your fund shares it is considered a taxable event for you  depending on the purchase price and the sale price of the shares you sell and any other adjustments to your tax basis for your shares you may have a gain or a loss on the

predecessor fund were transferred to the trust in exchange for shares of the successor fund the goodhaven fund commenced operations on   as successor to the goodhaven fund a series of professionally managed portfolios  the predecessor goodhaven fund a series of professionally managed portfolios commenced operations on april   the fund’s prospectus and this sai are a part of the trust’s registration statement filed with the sec  copies of the trust’s complete registration statement may be obtained from the sec upon payment of the prescribed fee or may be accessed free of charge at the sec’s website at wwwsecgov investment policies and risks the fund is nondiversified which means that there is no restriction under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” on how much the fund may invest in the securities of one issuer  however to qualify for tax treatment as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” the fund is required to comply as of the end of each taxable quarter with certain diversification requirements imposed by the code  pursuant to these requirements at the end of each taxable quarter the fund among other things will not have investments in the securities of any one issuer other than us government securities and securities of other regulated investment companies of more than  of the value of the fund’s total assets  in addition the fund with respect to  of its total assets will not have investments in the securities of any issuer equal to  of its total assets and will not purchase more than  of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  as a nondiversified investment company the fund may be subject to greater risks than diversified companies because of the larger impact of fluctuation in the values of securities of fewer issues     table of contents  statement of additional information    the following information supplements the discussion of the fund’s investment objective and policies as set forth in its prospectus  the fund may invest in the following types of investments each of which is subject to certain risks as discussed below risks associated with economic events since the financial crisis of  various markets for both debt and equity securities have experienced aboveaverage volatility when compared to other periods  in some cases instability in the credit markets has made it more difficult for some issuers of debt securities to obtain financing or refinancing for their investment or lending activities or operations credit market instability may also affect equity securities as they are generally the most junior claims against corporate assets periods of volatility in either debt or equity markets may negatively affect the market value of securities owned by the fund  a significant worsening of economic conditions separate and apart from market volatility may also adversely affect the ability of issuers of securities owned by the fund to raise capital refinance existing obligations affect credit ratings and in severe cases adversely affect an issuer’s ability to make payments of principal and interest when due  such developments could in turn reduce the value of securities owned by the fund and adversely affect the net asset value “nav” of its shares the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” significantly revises and expands the rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority of federal bank securities and commodities regulators  regulators could undertake rulemaking supervisory or enforcement actions that would adversely affect the fund or investments made by the fund  possible regulatory actions taken under these revised and expanded powers may include actions related to financial consumer protection proprietary trading and derivatives  there is a risk that new and additional government regulation authorized by the doddfrank act could result in higher costs and expenses to mutual funds generally including the fund government intervention in financial markets risk since  the us government and foreign governments to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced excess volatility and in some cases a lack of liquidity us federal and state governments and foreign governments their regulatory agencies or selfregulatory organizations may take additional actions that affect the regulation of the securities in which the fund invests or the issuers of such securities in ways that are unforeseeable and which could adversely affect the value of securities held by the fund or the manner in which the fund operates assetbacked securities the fund may invest in assetbacked securities  assetbacked securities are securities issued by trusts and special purpose entities that are backed by pools of assets such as automobile and creditcard receivables and home equity loans which pass through the payments on the underlying obligations to the security holders less servicing fees paid to the originator or fees for any credit enhancement  typically the originator of the loan or accounts receivable paper transfers it to a specially created trust which repackages it as securities with a minimum denomination and a specific term  the securities are then privately placed or publicly offered  for example the fund may invest in collateralized debt obligations “cdos” which include collateralized bond obligations “cbos” collateralized loan obligations “clos” and other similarly structured entities  cbos and clos are types of assetbacked securities  a cbo is a trust which is backed by a diversified pool of highrisk below investment grade fixedincome securities  a clo is a trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans which may include among others domestic and foreign senior secured loans senior unsecured loans and subordinate corporate loans including loans that may be rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans     table of contents  statement of additional information    the value of an assetbacked security is affected by among other things changes in the market’s perception of the asset backing the security the creditworthiness of the servicing agent for the loan pool the originator of the loans and the financial institution providing any credit enhancement  payments of principal and interest passed through to holders of assetbacked securities are frequently supported by some form of credit enhancement such as a letter of credit surety bond limited guarantee by another entity or by having a priority to certain of the borrower’s other assets  the degree of credit enhancement varies and generally applies to only a portion of the assetbacked security’s par value  value is also affected if any credit enhancement has been exhausted cash reserves although the fund will normally hold a focused portfolio comprised primarily of equity and fixed income securities the fund is not required to be fully invested and may maintain a significant portion of its total assets in cash and securities generally considered to be cash equivalents including but not limited to shortterm us and nonus government securities moneymarket funds commercial paper repurchase agreements bank deposits and other high quality money market instruments  from time to time cash and cash reserves may also include foreign securities including but not limited to shortterm obligations of foreign governments or other high quality foreign moneymarket instruments  the fund and the advisor believe that a certain amount of liquidity in the fund’s portfolio is desirable both to meet operating requirements and to take advantage of new investment opportunities  under conditions when the fund is unable to find sufficient investments meeting its criteria cash and cash reserves may comprise a large percentage of the fund’s total assets  when the fund holds a significant portion of assets in cash and cash reserves it may not meet its investment objective and the fund’s performance may significantly lag that of market indexes which by definition are composed of groups of securities without a cash component  to the extent the fund uses a money market mutual fund for its cash position there will be some duplication of expenses because the fund would bear its pro rata portion of such money market fund’s management fees and operational expenses credit default swap agreements the “buyer” in a credit default swap contract is obligated to pay the “seller” a periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract in return for a contingent payment upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to an underlying reference obligation  generally a credit event means bankruptcy failure to pay obligation acceleration or modified restructuring  the fund may be either the buyer or the seller in the transaction  as a seller the fund receives a fixed rate of income throughout the term of the contract which typically is between one month and five years provided that no credit event occurs  if a credit event occurs the fund typically must pay the contingent payment to the buyer which is typically the “par value” full notional value of the reference obligation  the contingent payment may be a cash settlement or by physical delivery of the reference obligation in return for payment of the face amount of the obligation  the value of the reference obligation received by the fund as a seller if a credit event occurs coupled with the periodic payments previously received may be less than the full notional value it pays to the buyer resulting in a loss of value to the fund  if the reference obligation is a defaulted security physical delivery of the security will cause the fund to hold a defaulted security  if the fund is a buyer and no credit event occurs the fund will lose its periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract  however if a credit event occurs the buyer typically receives full notional value for a reference obligation that may have little or no value  the fund intends to limit such activity to less than  of its assets     table of contents  statement of additional information    debt securities the fund may invest in debt securities including but not limited to corporate and us government debt securities and exchangetraded notes “etns”  corporate debt securities include but are not limited to debt obligations offered by public or private corporations either registered or unregistered  the market value of such securities may fluctuate in response to interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuer  etns are typically issued by a government or corporate entity where the value of the note may fluctuate based on factors other than interest rates or creditworthiness as a result of embedded or linked derivative contracts  etns may have a greater risk of loss than other debt securities under certain circumstances  the fund may invest in debt securities that are noninvestment grade or are in default us government debt securities include direct obligations of the us government and obligations issued by us government agencies and instrumentalities  although certain securities issued by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government others are supported only by the credit of that agency or instrumentality  there is no guarantee that the us government will provide support to such agencies or instrumentalities and such securities may involve risk of loss of principal and interest  in addition a security backed by the us treasury or the full faith and credit of the us government is guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity  the current market prices for such securities are not guaranteed and will fluctuate  certain us government agency securities or securities of us governmentsponsored entities are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury or are supported only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality  while the us government provides financial support to those us governmentsponsored agencies or instrumentalities no assurance can be given that it will always do so and those securities are neither guaranteed nor issued by the us government  in the case of securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government shareholders are primarily exposed to interest rate risk  the ratings for debt securities are described in appendix a municipal securities the fund may invest in municipal securities  municipal securities are issued by the states territories and possessions of the united states their political subdivisions such as cities counties and towns and various authorities such as public housing or redevelopment authorities instrumentalities public corporations and special districts such as water sewer or sanitary districts of the states territories and possessions of the united states or their political subdivisions  in addition municipal securities include securities issued by or on behalf of public authorities to finance various privately operated facilities such as industrial development bonds that are backed only by the assets and revenues of the nongovernmental user such as hospitals and airports municipal securities are issued to obtain funds for a variety of public purposes including general financing for state and local governments or financing for specific projects or public facilities  municipal securities are classified as general obligation or revenue bonds or notes  general obligation securities are secured by the issuer’s pledge of its full faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest  revenue securities are payable from revenue derived from a particular facility class of facilities or the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source but not from the issuer’s general taxing power  the fund will not invest more than  of its total assets in a single type of revenue bond private activity bonds and industrial revenue bonds do not carry the pledge of the credit of the issuing municipality but generally are guaranteed by the corporate entity on whose behalf they are issued     table of contents  statement of additional information    municipal leases are entered into by state and local governments and authorities to acquire equipment and facilities such as fire and sanitation vehicles telecommunications equipment and other assets  municipal leases which normally provide for title to the leased assets to pass eventually to the government issuer have evolved as a means for governmental issuers to acquire property and equipment without meeting the constitutional and statutory requirements for the issuance of debt  the debtissuance limitations of many state constitutions and statutes are deemed to be inapplicable because of the inclusion in many leases or contracts of “nonappropriation” clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for such purpose by the appropriate legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis derivatives the fund may but is not required to use derivatives for risk management purposes or as part of its investment strategies  derivatives are financial contracts whose values depend on or are derived from the value of an underlying asset reference rate or index  the fund may use derivatives to earn income and enhance returns to hedge or adjust the risk profile of its portfolio to replace more traditional direct investments and to obtain exposure to otherwise inaccessible markets   there are three types of derivatives in which the fund may invest futures options and swaps  derivatives may be  standardized exchangetraded contracts or  customized privately negotiated contracts  exchangetraded derivatives tend to be more liquid and subject to less credit risk than those that are privately negotiated   the fund’s use of derivatives may involve risks that are different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities or other more traditional instruments  these risks include the risk that the value of a derivative instrument may not correlate perfectly or at all with the value of the assets reference rates or indexes that they are designed to track  other risks include  an illiquid secondary market for a particular instrument and possible exchangeimposed price fluctuation limits either of which may make it difficult or impossible to close out a position when desired the risk that adverse price movements in an instrument can result in a loss substantially greater than the fund’s initial investment in that instrument in some cases the potential loss is unlimited and the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations  in the aggregate the fund intends to limit derivative positions to not more than  of assets the fund may use the following types of derivatives futures contracts and options on futures contracts a futures contract is an agreement that obligates the buyer to buy and the seller to sell a specified quantity of an underlying asset or settle for cash the value of a contract based on an underlying asset rate or index at a specific price on the contract maturity date  options on futures contracts are options that call for the delivery of futures contracts upon exercise  the fund may purchase or sell futures contracts and options thereon to hedge against changes in interest rates securities through index futures or options or currencies  the fund may also purchase or sell futures contracts for foreign currencies or options thereon for nonhedging purposes as a means of making direct investments in foreign currencies options an option is an agreement that for a premium payment or fee gives the option holder the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy a “call option” or sell a “put option” the underlying asset or settle for cash an amount based on an underlying asset rate or index at a specified price the exercise price during a period of time or on a specified date  investments in options are considered speculative  the fund may lose the premium paid for them if the price of the underlying security or other asset decreased or remained the same in the case of a call option or increased or remained the same in the case of a put option  if a put or call option purchased by the fund were permitted to expire without being sold or exercised its premium would represent a loss to the fund the fund’s investments in options include the following     table of contents  statement of additional information    o      options on foreign currencies   the fund may purchase or sell call or put options on foreign currencies that are privately negotiated or traded on us or foreign exchanges for hedging purposes to protect against declines in the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated securities held by the fund and against increases in the us dollar cost of securities to be acquired  the purchase of an option on a foreign currency may constitute an effective hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates although if rates move adversely the fund may forfeit the entire amount of the premium plus related transaction costs  the fund may also purchase or sell options on foreign currencies for nonhedging purposes as a means of making direct investments in foreign currencies o      options on securities   the fund may purchase or sell call or put options on securities  the fund will only exercise an option it purchased if the price of the security was less in the case of a put option or more in the case of a call option than the exercise price  if the fund does not exercise an option the premium it paid for the option will be lost  normally the fund will sell only “covered” options which means writing an option for securities the fund owns but may write an uncovered call option for crosshedging purposes o      options on securities indices   an option on a securities index is similar to an option on a security except that rather than taking or making delivery of a security at a specified price an option on a securities index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the chosen index is greater than in the case of a call or less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option swaps a swap which may be a customized and privately negotiated agreement or a standardized and exchangetraded contract obligates two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals payment dates based upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a specified amount of an underlying asset the “notional” principal amount  swaps are entered into on a net basis  ie  the two payment streams are netted out with a fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments  examples of such swaps may include but are not limited to currency swaps interest rate swaps total return swaps and credit default swaps  payments received by the fund from swap agreements will result in taxable income either as ordinary income or capital gains  except for currency swaps the notional principal amount is used solely to calculate the payment streams but is not exchanged  with respect to currency swaps actual principal amounts of currencies may be exchanged by the counterparties at the initiation and again upon the termination of the transaction  the swap market has grown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation  as a result the swap market has become well established and relatively liquid exclusion from definition of commodity pool operator pursuant to amendments by the commodity futures trading commission to rule  under the commodity exchange act “cea” the advisor will take all necessary regulatory action including filing a notice of exemption from registration as a “commodity pool operator” with respect to the fund prior to the execution of any such transactions  upon filing the fund and the advisor would therefore not be subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under the cea  effective december   in order to claim the rule  exemption the fund is significantly limited in its ability to invest in commodity futures options and swaps including securities futures broadbased stock index futures and financial futures contracts  as a result in the future the advisor will be more limited in its ability to use these instruments on behalf of the fund than in the past and these limitations may negatively impact the fund’s performance     table of contents  statement of additional information    equity securities the fund may invest in equity securities consistent with its investment objective and strategies  common stocks preferred stocks and convertible securities are examples of equity securities all investments in equity securities are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time  historically the equity markets have moved in cycles and the value of the securities in the fund’s portfolio may fluctuate substantially from day to day  moreover many equity securities do not pay dividends or other distributions and an issuer of an equity security that does pay dividends may elect to discontinue such dividends at any time to the extent the fund invests in the equity securities of small or mediumsize companies it will be exposed to the risks of small and mediumsized companies  such companies often have limited product lines or offer fewer services have narrower markets for their goods andor services and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger more established companies  in addition there is frequently less publicly available information when compared to larger companies due to limited press coverage limited investment analyst coverage and limited institutional ownership  adverse publicity and investor perceptions whether or not based on fundamental analysis can decrease the price and liquidity of securities held by the fund  as smaller companies typically have less access to resources than larger companies their share prices can be more volatile and they face greater risk of business failure which could increase the risk of the fund’s portfolio common stock a common stock represents a proportional share of the ownership of a company and its value is based on the success and prospects of the company’s business the cash a company generates and the value of a company’s assets  however over short periods of time the price of any company whether successful or not may increase or decrease by a meaningful percentage  in addition to the general risks set forth above investments in common stocks are subject to the risk that a company in which the fund invests is liquidated and the liquidation proceeds are insufficient to provide value to all security holders to the extent the fund holds common stock or other junior securities in a liquidating company the creditors or other senior security holders of the company will be paid first raising the possibility that assets will be exhausted before any payments are made to the fund preferred stock preferred stocks are equity securities that often pay dividends at a specific rate and have a preference over common stocks in dividend payments and liquidation of assets  a preferred stock has a blend of the characteristics of a bond and common stock  it can offer the higher yield of a bond and has priority over common stock in equity ownership but does not have the seniority of a bond and unlike common stock its participation in the issuer’s growth may be limited  although the dividend is set at a fixed annual rate in some circumstances it can be changed or omitted by the issuer convertible securities the fund may invest in convertible securities  convertible securities such as debt securities or preferred stock may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock of the same or different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula  a convertible security entitles the holder to receive interest paid or accrued on debt or dividends paid on preferred stock until the convertible stock matures or is redeemed converted or exchanged  while no securities investment is without risk investments in convertible securities are generally less risky than the issuer’s common stock  however the extent to which such risk is reduced depends in large measure upon the degree to which the convertible security sells above its value as a fixed income security  in addition to the general risk associated with equity securities discussed above the market value of convertible securities is also affected by prevailing interest rates the credit quality of the issuer and any call provisions  while convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible debt securities of similar quality they do enable the investor to benefit from increases in the market price of the underlying common stock     table of contents  statement of additional information    rights and warrants the fund may invest in rights or warrants  rights and warrants entitle the holder to buy equity securities at a specific price for a specific period of time  rights and warrants may be considered more speculative than certain other types of investments in that they do not entitle a holder to dividends or voting rights with respect to the underlying securities that may be purchased nor do they represent any rights in the assets of the issuing company  also the value of a right or warrant does not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities and a right or warrant ceases to have value if it is not exercised prior to the expiration date foreign securities the fund may invest in american depositary receipts “adrs” global depositary receipts “gdrs” and shares listed on foreign exchanges and may invest up to  of its total assets in foreign equity securities including but not limited to corporate debt securities and shortterm debt obligations of foreign governments and other foreign moneymarket instruments  in determining whether a company is foreign the advisor will consider various factors including where the company is headquartered where the company’s principal operations are located where the company’s revenues are derived where the principal trading market is located and the country in which the company is legally organized  the weight given to each of these factors will vary depending upon the circumstances  investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk than those in domestic securities and may have additional risks related to fluctuating currency values adrs in registered form are dollardenominated securities designed for use in the us securities markets  adrs are sponsored and issued by domestic banks and they represent and may be converted into underlying foreign securities deposited with the domestic bank or a correspondent bank  adrs do not eliminate the risks inherent in investing in the securities of foreign issuers  by investing in adrs rather than directly in the foreign security however the fund may avoid currency risks during the settlement period for either purchases or sales  there is a large liquid market in the united states for most adrs  gdrs are receipts representing an arrangement with a major foreign bank similar to that for adrs  gdrs are not necessarily denominated in the currency of the underlying security  adrs gdrs and the securities of foreign companies traded on a us stock exchange are not considered foreign securities for purposes of calculation of any investment limitation placed on the fund’s exposure to foreign securities shortterm debt obligations of foreign governments acquired by the fund will generally have a maturity of one year or less and a credit rating of “a” or better by standard  poor’s “sp” or a similar rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro”  other debt securities of foreign companies may be purchased by the fund without regard to nrsro ratings securities of foreign issuers may be subject to greater fluctuations in price than domestic securities  the price of foreign securities is affected by changes in currency exchange rates  to the extent that the fund invests in securities of foreign issuers political or economic instability of the country of the issuer especially in emerging or developing countries could cause rapid and extreme changes in the value of the fund’s assets  foreign countries have different accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and foreign issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation and oversight than us issuers  also many countries where the fund may invest are not as politically or economically developed as the united states  to the extent that the fund owns foreign securities acts of foreign governments interfering in capital markets such as capital or currency controls nationalization of companies or industries expropriation of assets or imposition of punitive taxes could adversely affect the fund  in addition costs may be incurred in connection with the fund’s foreign investments  foreign brokerage commissions are generally higher than those in the united states  expenses may also be incurred on currency conversions when the fund moves investments from one country to another  administrative difficulties may also be experienced in connection with maintaining assets in foreign jurisdictions     table of contents  statement of additional information    the fund’s investments in nonus securities are most likely to occur in developed countries although it may also invest up to  of its total assets in foreign companies located in developing or emerging market securities  the considerations noted above regarding the risk of investing in foreign securities are generally more significant for investments in emerging or developing countries such as countries in eastern europe latin america south america or southeast asia  these countries may have relatively unstable governments and securities markets in which only a small number of securities trade  markets of developing or emerging countries may generally be more volatile than markets of developed countries  investment in these markets may involve significantly greater risks as well as the potential for greater gains illiquid securities the fund may not invest more than  of the value of its net assets in illiquid securities  the advisor will monitor the amount of illiquid securities in the fund’s portfolio under the supervision of the board to ensure compliance with this investment restriction historically illiquid securities have included securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale because they have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended the “ act” securities which are otherwise not readily marketable and repurchase agreements having a maturity of longer than seven days  securities which have not been registered under the  act are referred to as private placement or restricted securities and are purchased directly from the issuer or in the secondary market  mutual funds do not typically hold a significant amount of these restricted or other illiquid securities because of the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation  limitations on resale may have an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities and the fund might be unable to sell restricted or other illiquid securities promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemption requests within seven days  the fund might also have to register such restricted securities in order to sell them resulting in additional expense and delay  adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of securities   loan participations and assignments bank debt the fund may invest in bank debt which includes interests in loans to companies or their affiliates undertaken to finance a capital restructuring or in connection with recapitalizations acquisitions leveraged buyouts refinancings or other financially leveraged transactions and may include loans which are designed to provide temporary or bridge financing to a borrower pending the sale of identified assets the arrangement of longerterm loans or the issuance and sale of debt obligations  these loans which may bear fixed or floating rates have generally been arranged through private negotiations between a corporate borrower and one or more financial institutions “lenders” including banks  the fund’s investment may be in the form of participations in loans “participations” or of assignments of all or a portion of loans from third parties “assignments”     table of contents  statement of additional information    the fund has the right to receive payments of principal interest and any fees to which it is entitled only from the lender selling a participation and only upon receipt by the lender of the payments from the borrower  in connection with purchasing participations the fund generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement relating to the loan nor any rights of setoff against the borrower and the fund may not benefit directly from any collateral supporting the loan in which it has purchased the participation  thus the fund assumes the credit risk of both the borrower and the lender that is selling the participation  in addition in connection with purchasing participations the fund generally will have no role in terms of negotiating or effecting amendments waivers and consents with respect to the loans underlying the participations  in the event of the insolvency of the lender the fund may be treated as a general creditor of the lender and may not benefit from any setoff between the lender and the borrower in certain cases the rights and obligations acquired by the fund through the purchase of an assignment may differ from and be more limited than those held by the assigning selling institution  assignments are sold strictly without recourse to the selling institutions and the selling institutions will generally make no representations or warranties to the fund about the underlying loan the borrowers the documentation of the loans or any collateral securing the loans investments in participations and assignments involve additional risks including the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest by the borrower the risk that any loan collateral may become impaired and that the fund may obtain less than the full value for the loan interests sold because they may be illiquid  purchasers of loans depend primarily upon the creditworthiness of the borrower for payment of interest and repayment of principal  if scheduled interest or principal payments are not made the value of the instrument may be adversely affected investments in loans through direct assignment of a financial institution’s interests with respect to a loan may involve additional risks  for example if a loan is foreclosed the fund could become part owner of any collateral and would bear the costs and liabilities associated with owning and disposing of the collateral a loan is often administered by a bank or other financial institution that acts as agent for all holders  the agent administers the terms of the loan as specified in the loan agreement  unless under the terms of the loan or other indebtedness the fund has direct recourse against the borrower the fund may have to rely on the agent to apply appropriate credit remedies against a borrower  if assets held by the agent for the benefit of the fund were determined to be subject to the claims of the agent’s general creditors the fund might incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment on the loan or loan participation and could suffer a loss of principal or interest interests in loans are also subject to additional liquidity risks  loans are generally subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale  loans are not currently listed on any securities exchange or automatic quotation system but are traded by banks and other institutional investors engaged in loan syndication  as a result no active market may exist for some loans and to the extent a secondary market exists for other loans such market may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods  consequently the fund may have difficulty disposing of assignments or participations in response to a specific economic event such as deterioration in the creditworthiness of the borrower which can result in a loss  in such market situations it may be more difficult for the fund to assign a value to assignments or participations when valuing the fund’s securities and calculating its net asset value “nav”     table of contents  statement of additional information    margin purchases the fund may not purchase securities on margin except  as otherwise permitted under rules adopted by the sec under the  act or by guidance regarding the  act or interpretations thereof and  that the fund may obtain such shortterm credits as are necessary for the clearance of portfolio transactions and the fund may make margin payments in connection with futures contracts options forward contracts swaps and other financial instruments other investment companies the fund may invest its assets in the securities of other registered investment companies subject to the limitations set forth in the  act  investments in the securities of other investment companies will likely result in the duplication of advisory fees and certain other expenses  by investing in another investment company the fund becomes a shareholder of that investment company  as a result fund shareholders indirectly will bear the fund’s proportionate share of the fees and expenses paid by shareholders of the other investment company in addition to the fees and expenses fund shareholders directly bear in connection with the fund’s own operations section d of the  act restricts investments by registered investment companies in securities of other registered investment companies  the acquisition of shares by the fund in other registered investment companies is therefore subject to the restrictions of section d of the  act except that the fund may hold more than  of the outstanding shares of an etf if that etf has obtained an exemptive order from the sec that would permit the fund to invest in that etf beyond the limits of section d subject to certain terms and conditions including that the fund enter into an agreement with that etf regarding the terms of the investment section da of the  act generally prohibits a fund from purchasing  more than  of the total outstanding voting stock of another fund  securities of another fund having an aggregate value in excess of  of the value of the acquiring fund and  securities of the other fund and all other funds having an aggregate value in excess of  of the value of the total assets of the acquiring fund  there are some exceptions however to these limitations pursuant to various rules promulgated by the sec in accordance with section df and rule d of the  act the provisions of section d shall not apply to securities purchased or otherwise acquired by the fund if i immediately after such purchase or acquisition not more than  of the total outstanding stock of such registered investment company is owned by the fund and all affiliated persons of the fund and ii the fund is not proposing to offer or sell any security issued by it through a principal underwriter or otherwise at a public or offering price including a sales load that exceeds the limits set forth in rule  of the conduct rules of the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” applicable to a fund of funds  ie  exchangetraded funds the fund may also invest in shares of etfs  etfs are investment companies which seek to replicate the performance before fees and expenses of an underlying index of securities  an etf is similar to a traditional mutual fund but trades at different prices during the day on a security exchange like a stock  similar to investments in other investment companies discussed above the fund’s investments in etfs will involve duplication of advisory fees and other expenses since the fund will be investing in another investment company  in addition the fund’s investment in etfs is also subject to its limitations on investments in investment companies discussed above  to the extent the fund invests in etfs which focus on a particular market segment or industry the fund will also be subject to the risks associated with investing in those sectors or industries  the shares of the etfs in which the fund will invest will be listed on a national securities exchange and the fund will purchase or sell these shares on the secondary market at their current market price which may be more or less than their nav     table of contents  statement of additional information    as a purchaser of etf shares on the secondary market the fund will be subject to the market risk associated with owning any security whose value is based on market price  etf shares historically have tended to trade at or near their nav but there is no guarantee that they will continue to do so  unlike traditional mutual funds shares of an etf may be purchased and redeemed directly from the etfs only in large blocks typically  shares or more and only through participating organizations that have entered into contractual agreements with the etf  the fund does not expect to enter into such agreements and therefore will not be able to purchase and redeem its etf shares directly from the etf  in addition to and pursuant to its previously described limited ability to invest in derivatives the fund may invest in derivatives that are based on etf shares real estate investment trusts the fund may invest in real estate investment trusts “reits”  equity reits invest directly in real property while mortgage reits invest in mortgages on real property  reits may be subject to certain risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate including declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and local economic conditions overbuilding and increased competition increases in property taxes and operating expenses and variations in rental income  reits pay dividends to their shareholders based upon available funds from operations  it is quite common for these dividends to exceed a reit’s taxable earnings and profits resulting in the excess portion of such dividends being designated as a return of capital  the fund intends to include the gross dividends from such reits in its distribution to its shareholders and accordingly a portion of the fund’s distributions may also be designated as a return of capital repurchase agreements the fund may invest in repurchase agreements  the fund will invest no more than  of the fund’s assets in such agreements  pursuant to such agreements the fund acquires securities from financial institutions such as banks and brokerdealers as are deemed to be creditworthy by the advisor subject to the seller’s agreement to repurchase and the fund’s agreement to resell such securities at a mutually agreed upon date and price  the repurchase price generally equals the price paid by the fund plus interest negotiated on the basis of current shortterm rates which may be more or less than the rate on the underlying portfolio security  the seller under a repurchase agreement will be required to maintain the value of the underlying securities at not less than  of the repurchase price under the agreement  if the seller defaults on its repurchase obligation the fund will suffer a loss to the extent that the proceeds from a sale of the underlying securities are less than the repurchase price under the agreement  bankruptcy or insolvency of such a defaulting seller may cause the fund’s rights with respect to such securities to be delayed or limited  repurchase agreements are considered to be loans under the  act  should the fund’s intent to invest in repurchase agreements change the fund may enter into repurchase agreements of short durations from overnight to one week although the underlying securities would generally have longer maturities  the fund may not enter into a repurchase agreement with more than seven days to maturity if as a result more than  of the value of its net assets would be invested in illiquid securities including such repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements the fund may borrow funds for temporary purposes by entering into reverse repurchase agreements in accordance with the fund’s investment restrictions  pursuant to such agreements the fund would sell portfolio securities to financial institutions such as banks and brokerdealers and agree to repurchase the securities at the mutually agreedupon date and price  the fund would enter into reverse repurchase agreements only to avoid otherwise selling securities during unfavorable market conditions to meet redemptions  when the fund enters into a reverse repurchase agreement it will place assets that are consistent with the fund’s investment restrictions by having a value equal to the repurchase price including accrued interest in a segregated custodial account and will subsequently monitor the account to ensure that such equivalent value is maintained  such assets will include us government securities or other liquid highgrade debt securities     table of contents  statement of additional information    the use of reverse repurchase agreements by the fund creates leverage which increases the fund’s investment risk  if the income and gains on securities purchased with the proceeds of reverse repurchase agreements exceed the cost of the agreements the fund’s earnings or nav will increase faster than otherwise would be the case  conversely if the income and gains fail to exceed the costs earnings or nav would decline faster than otherwise would be the case  the fund will seek to enter reverse repurchase agreements only when the interest income to be earned from the investment of the proceeds of the transaction is greater than the interest expense of the transaction  reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the securities sold by the fund may decline below the price at which the fund is obligated to repurchase the securities  reverse repurchase agreements are considered to be borrowing by under the  act borrowing the fund may borrow money in amounts of up to onethird of its total assets including the amount borrowed  in addition the fund is authorized to borrow money from time to time for temporary extraordinary or emergency purposes or for clearance of transactions  the use of borrowing by the fund involves special risk considerations that may not be associated with other funds having similar objectives and policies  since substantially all of the fund’s assets fluctuate in value while the interest obligation resulting from a borrowing will be fixed by the terms of the fund’s agreement with its lender the nav per share of the fund will tend to increase more when its portfolio securities increase in value and to decrease more when its portfolio assets decrease in value than would otherwise be the case if the fund did not borrow funds  in addition interest costs on borrowings may fluctuate with changing market rates of interest and may partially offset or exceed the return earned on borrowed funds  under adverse market conditions the fund might have to sell portfolio securities to meet interest or principal payments at a time when fundamental investment considerations would not favor such sales the  act permits a portfolio to borrow money in amounts of up to onethird of a fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose and to borrow up to  of a fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes  to limit the risks attendant to borrowing the  act requires the fund to maintain at all times “asset coverage” of at least  of the amount of its borrowings  asset coverage means the ratio that the value of a fund’s total assets minus liabilities other than borrowings bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings  borrowing money to increase a fund’s investment portfolio is known as “leveraging”  borrowing especially when used for leverage may cause the value of a fund’s shares to be more volatile than if a fund did not borrow  borrowed money thus creates an opportunity for greater gains but also greater losses  to repay borrowings a fund may have to sell securities at a time and at a price that is unfavorable to the fund  there also are costs associated with borrowing money and these costs would offset and could eliminate a fund’s net investment income in any given period  reverse repurchase agreements may be considered to be a type of borrowing  shortterm credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy  practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy  such trading practices may include futures options on futures forward contracts and other derivative investments the  act prohibits the fund from issuing senior securities except that the fund may borrow money in amounts of up to onethird of the fund’s total assets for any purpose  the fund also may borrow up to  of the fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes and these borrowings are not considered senior securities  the issuance of senior securities by the fund can increase the speculative character of the fund’s outstanding shares through leveraging  leveraging of the fund’s portfolio through the issuance of senior securities magnifies the potential for gain or loss because even though the fund’s net assets remain the same the total risk to investors is increased  certain widely used investment practices that involve a commitment by the fund to deliver money or securities in the future are not considered by the sec to be senior securities provided that the fund segregates cash or liquid securities in an amount necessary to pay the obligation or the fund holds an offsetting commitment from another party  these investment practices include repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements swaps dollar rolls options futures and forward contracts  the fund’s policy on borrowing will be interpreted not to prevent collateral arrangements with respect to swaps options forward or futures contracts or other derivatives or the posting of initial or variation margin     table of contents  statement of additional information    securities lending the fund reserves the right pending receipt of board approval to lend securities from its portfolio to brokers dealers and financial institutions but not individuals in order to increase the return on its portfolio  the sec currently requires that the following conditions must be met whenever the fund’s portfolio securities are loaned   the fund must receive at least  cash collateral from the borrower  the borrower must increase such collateral whenever the market value of the securities rises above the level of such collateral  the fund must be able to terminate the loan at any time  the fund must receive reasonable interest on the loan as well as any dividends interest or other distributions on the loaned securities and any increase in market value  the fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees approved by the board in connection with the loan  while voting rights on the loaned securities may pass to the borrower the board must terminate the loan and regain the right to vote the securities if a material event adversely affecting the investment occurs and  the fund may not loan its portfolio securities so that the value of the loaned securities is more than onethird of its total asset value including collateral received from such loans  these conditions may be subject to future modification  such loans will be terminable at any time upon specified notice  the fund might experience the risk of loss if the institution with which it has engaged in a portfolio loan transaction breaches its agreement with the fund  in addition the fund will not enter into any portfolio security lending arrangement having a duration of longer than one year  the principal risk of portfolio lending is potential default or insolvency of the borrower  in either of these cases the fund could experience delays in recovering securities or collateral or could lose all or part of the value of the loaned securities  as part of participating in a lending program the fund may be required to invest in collateralized debt or other securities that bear the risk of loss of principal  in addition all investments made with the collateral received are subject to the risks associated with such investments  if such investments lose value the fund will have to cover the loss when repaying the collateral any loans of portfolio securities are fully collateralized based on values that are markedtomarket daily  any securities that the fund may receive as collateral will not become part of the fund’s investment portfolio at the time of the loan and in the event of a default by the borrower the fund will if permitted by law dispose of such collateral except for such part thereof that is a security in which the fund is permitted to invest  during the time securities are on loan the borrower will pay the fund any accrued income on those securities and the fund may invest the cash collateral and earn income or receive an agreedupon fee from a borrower that has delivered cashequivalent collateral restricted securities the fund may invest in securities that are subject to restrictions on resale because they have not been registered under the  act  these securities are sometimes referred to as private placements  although securities which may be resold only to “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with the provisions of rule a under the  act are technically considered “restricted securities” the fund may purchase rule a securities without regard to the limitation on investments in illiquid securities described above in the “illiquid securities” section provided that a determination is made that such securities have a readily available trading market  the fund may also purchase certain commercial paper issued in reliance on the exemption from regulations in section  of the securities act “ paper”  the advisor will determine the liquidity of rule a securities and  paper under the supervision of the board  the liquidity of rule a securities and  paper will be monitored by the advisor and if as a result of changed conditions it is determined that a rule a security or  paper is no longer liquid the fund’s holdings of illiquid securities will be reviewed to determine what if any action is required to assure that the fund does not exceed its applicable percentage limitation for investments in illiquid securities     table of contents  statement of additional information    limitations on the resale of restricted securities may have an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities and the fund might be unable to dispose of restricted securities promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemption requirements  the fund might also have to register such restricted securities in order to dispose of them resulting in additional expense and delay  adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of securities   short sales the fund may make short sales as a part of overall portfolio management or to offset a potential decline in the value of a security  a short sale involves the sale of a security that the fund does not own or if the fund owns the security is not to be delivered upon consummation of the sale  when the fund makes a short sale of a security that it does not own it must borrow from a brokerdealer the security sold short and deliver the security to the brokerdealer upon conclusion of the short sale if the price of the security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the time the fund replaces the borrowed security the fund will incur a loss conversely if the price declines the fund will realize a shortterm capital gain  although the fund’s gain is limited to the price at which it sold the security short its potential loss is theoretically unlimited typically the fund will segregate liquid assets which are markedtomarket daily equal to the difference between a the market value of the securities sold short at the time they were sold short and b the value of the collateral deposited with the broker in connection with the short sale not including the proceeds from the short sale  while the short position is open the fund must maintain segregated assets at such a level that the amount segregated plus the amount deposited with the broker as collateral equal the current market value of the securities sold short  when a short position is closed out it may result in a short term capital gain or loss for federal income tax purposes  to the extent that in a generally rising market a fund maintains short positions in securities rising with the market the nav of the fund would be expected to increase to a lesser extent than the nav of an investment company that does not engage in short sales the dollar amount of short sales at any one time not including short sales against the box may not exceed  of the net assets of the fund and it is expected that normally the dollar amount of such sales will not exceed  of the net assets of the fund shortterm investments the fund may invest in any of the following securities and instruments certificates of deposit bankers’ acceptances and time deposits the fund may hold certificates of deposit bankers’ acceptances and time deposits  certificates of deposit are negotiable certificates issued against funds deposited in a commercial bank for a definite period of time and earning a specified return  bankers’ acceptances are negotiable drafts or bills of exchange normally drawn by an importer or exporter to pay for specific merchandise which are “accepted” by a bank meaning in effect that the bank unconditionally agrees to pay the face value of the instrument on maturity  certificates of deposit and bankers’ acceptances acquired by the fund will be dollardenominated obligations of domestic banks savings and loan associations or financial institutions which at the time of purchase have capital surplus and undivided profits in excess of  million including assets of both domestic and foreign branches based on latest published reports or less than  million if the principal amount of such bank obligations are fully insured by the us government     table of contents  statement of additional information    in addition to buying certificates of deposit and bankers’ acceptances the fund also may make interestbearing time or other interestbearing deposits in commercial or savings banks  time deposits are nonnegotiable deposits maintained at a banking institution for a specified period of time at a specified interest rate commercial paper and shortterm notes the fund may invest a portion of its assets in commercial paper and shortterm notes  commercial paper consists of unsecured promissory notes issued by corporations  commercial paper and shortterm notes will normally have maturities of less than nine months and fixed rates of return although such instruments may have maturities of up to one year commercial paper and shortterm notes will consist of issues rated at the time of purchase a or higher by sp ®  “prime” or “prime” by moody’s or similarly rated by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization or if unrated will be determined by the advisor to be of comparable quality  these rating symbols are described in the appendix special situations from time to time the fund intends to invest in special situations which may involve purchases of securities including but not limited to equity securities fixedincome securities which may include high yield debt securities or “junk bonds” and securities of companies that are in default  a special situation arises when in the opinion of the advisor the securities of a company will within a reasonably estimated time appreciate in value due to company specific developments that are independent of general business or market conditions  such developments and situations include but are not limited to liquidations reorganizations recapitalizations mergers material litigation technological breakthroughs and new management or management policies  although large and wellknown companies may be involved special situations often involve greater risk than is found in the normal course of investing whenissued securities the fund may from time to time purchase or sell securities on a “whenissued” basis  the price of such securities which may be expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase or sell is made but delivery and payment for them take place at a later date  normally the settlement date occurs within one month of the purchase during the period between purchase or sale and settlement no payment is made or received by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund  to the extent that assets of the fund are held in cash pending the settlement of a purchase of securities the fund would earn no income nor would it pay interest on any proceeds  while purchased whenissued securities may be sold prior to the settlement date or sold whenissued securities may be purchased prior to the settlement date the fund intends to proceed with the transaction unless a contratransaction appears desirable for investment reasons  at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase or sell a security on a whenissued basis it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security or the anticipated proceeds in determining its nav  the market value of the whenissued securities may be more or less than the purchase or sale price  the fund does not believe that its nav or income will be adversely affected by its purchase or sale of securities on a whenissued basis  the fund’s custodian will segregate liquid assets equal in value to commitments for whenissued securities  such segregated assets either will mature or if necessary be sold on or before the settlement date  finally it is further noted that whenissued transactions may be subject to cancellation under certain conditions and such cancellation may affect the fund’s nav either positively or negatively as a result     table of contents  statement of additional information      control and other substantial positions the fund may make investments in the securities of a company for the purpose of affecting the management or control of the company subject to applicable legal restrictions with respect to the investment these investments impose additional risks for the fund other than a possible decline in the value of the investments  the fund individually or together with other accounts managed by the advisor may obtain a controlling or other substantial position in a public or private company each a “portfolio company”  should the fund and other accounts managed by the advisor obtain such a position the advisor may be required to make filings with the sec concerning holdings in the portfolio company  the application of statutory and regulatory requirements to the fund or to the advisor and its affiliates could restrict activities contemplated by the fund or the advisor and its affiliates with respect to a portfolio company or limit the time and the manner in which the fund is able to dispose of its holdings or hedge such holdings  the fund or the advisor and its affiliates may be required to obtain relief from the sec or its staff prior to engaging in certain activities with respect to a portfolio company that could be deemed a joint arrangement under the  act the fund may incur substantial expenses when taking control or other substantial positions in a company and there is no guarantee that such expenses can be recouped  in addition the fund’s investments could be frozen in minority positions and the fund could incur substantial losses the fund could be exposed to various legal claims by a portfolio company its security holders and its creditors arising from among other things the fund’s status as an insider or control person of a portfolio company or from the advisor’s designation of directors to serve on the boards of directors of a portfolio company  such legal claims include claims that the fund or the advisor as a controlling person is liable for securities laws violations by the portfolio company or environmental damage or product defects caused by the portfolio company or failure to supervise the portfolio company  such legal claims also include claims that the fund as a control person or significant shareholder of the portfolio company has a fiduciary responsibility to other shareholders in connection with the fund’s voting or investment decisions with respect to its holdings of the portfolio company’s shares  notwithstanding the foregoing neither the fund nor the advisor intend to have unilateral control of any portfolio company and accordingly may be unable to control the timing or occurrence of an exit strategy for any portfolio company investment restrictions the trust on behalf of the fund has adopted the following restrictions as fundamental policies which may not be changed without the affirmative vote of the holders of a “majority” of the outstanding voting securities of the fund  under the  act the “vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities” means the vote of the holders of the lesser of   of the shares of the fund represented at a meeting at which the holders of more than  of the fund’s outstanding shares are represented or  more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund  the fund may not      borrow money or issue senior securities except through reverse repurchase agreements or otherwise as permitted under the  act as interpreted modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority  generally issuing senior securities is prohibited under the  act however certain exceptions apply such as in the case of reverse repurchase agreements borrowing and certain other leveraging transactions      act as underwriter except to the extent the fund may be deemed to be an underwriter in connection with the sale of securities in its investment portfolio     table of contents  statement of additional information         invest  or more of its net assets calculated at the time of purchase and taken at market value in securities of issuers in any one industry other than us government securities      purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities although the fund may purchase and sell securities that are secured by real estate and securities of companies that invest or deal in real estate      purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments  this limitation shall not prevent the fund from purchasing selling or entering into futures contracts or acquiring securities or other instruments and options thereon backed by or related to physical commodities or      make loans except purchases of debt securities consistent with the investment policies of the fund  for purposes of this limitation entering into repurchase agreements lending securities and acquiring any debt security are not deemed to be the making of loans except with respect to borrowing if a percentage or rating restriction on investment or use of assets set forth herein or in the prospectus is adhered to at the time a transaction is effected later changes in the percentage or rating resulting from any cause other than actions by the fund will not be considered a violation of the fund’s investment restrictions  if the value of the fund’s holdings of illiquid securities at any time exceeds the percentage limitation applicable due to subsequent fluctuations in value or other reasons the board will consider what actions if any are appropriate to maintain adequate liquidity the following is a list of some nonfundamental investment restrictions applicable to the fund  these restrictions can be changed by the board but the change will only be effective after notice is given to shareholders of the fund  the fund may not      mortgage pledge or hypothecate any of its assets except in connection with any such borrowings and only with respect to  of its assets   portfolio turnover although the fund generally does not invest for shortterm trading purposes certain investment strategies may result in short holdings periods and portfolio securities may be sold without regard to the length of time they have been held when in the opinion of the advisor investment considerations warrant such action  portfolio turnover rate is calculated by dividing  the lesser of purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the fiscal year by  the monthly average of the value of portfolio securities owned during the fiscal year  a  turnover rate would occur if all the securities in the fund’s portfolio with the exception of securities whose maturities at the time of acquisition were one year or less were sold and either repurchased or replaced within one year  a high rate of portfolio turnover  or more generally leads to higher transaction costs and may result in a greater number of taxable transactions  see “execution of portfolio transactions”   for more information following is the predecessor fund’s portfolio turnover rate for the past two fiscal years portfolio turnover rate   year ended november     year ended november        table of contents  statement of additional information    portfolio holdings information the trust on behalf of the fund has adopted portfolio holdings disclosure policies that govern the timing and circumstances of disclosure of portfolio holdings of the fund  the advisor has also adopted a policy with respect to disclosure of portfolio holdings of the fund the “advisor’s policy”  information about the fund’s portfolio holdings will not be distributed to any third party except in accordance with the portfolio holdings policies and the advisor’s policy the “disclosure policies”  the advisor and the board considered the circumstances under which the fund’s portfolio holdings may be disclosed under the disclosure policies and the actual and potential material conflicts that could arise in such circumstances between the interests of the fund’s shareholders and the interests of the advisor distributor or any other affiliated person of the fund  after due consideration the advisor and the board determined that the fund has a legitimate business purpose for disclosing portfolio holdings to persons described in the disclosure policies including mutual fund rating or statistical agencies or persons performing similar functions and internal parties involved in the investment process administration or custody of the fund  pursuant to the disclosure policies the trust’s chairman chief compliance officer “cco” president and treasurer are each authorized to consider and authorize dissemination of portfolio holdings information to additional third parties after considering the best interests of the shareholders and potential conflicts of interest in making such disclosures the board exercises continuing oversight of the disclosure of the fund’s portfolio holdings by  overseeing the implementation and enforcement of the disclosure policies codes of ethics and other relevant policies of the fund and its service providers by the trust’s cco  by considering reports and recommendations by the trust’s cco concerning any material compliance matters as defined in rule a under the  act and  by considering to approve any amendment to these disclosure policies  the board reserves the right to amend the disclosure policies at any time without prior notice in their sole discretion disclosure of the fund’s complete holdings is required to be made quarterly within  days of the end of each period covered by the annual report and semiannual report to fund shareholders and in the quarterly holdings report on form nq  these reports are available free of charge on the edgar database on the sec’s website at wwwsecgov  portfolio holdings information may be separately provided to any person including rating and ranking organizations such as lipper and morningstar at the same time that it is filed with the sec  the advisor maintains a portfolio disclosure policy and it is the general policy of the advisor not to release portfolio holdings of any portfolio it manages prior to required regulatory disclosure  however the advisor may under certain circumstances disclose holdings at such other times as the policy permits in the event of a conflict between the interests of the fund and the interests of the advisor or an affiliated person of the advisor the cco of the advisor shall make a determination in the best interests of the fund and shall report such

the trustees of the trust are not “interested persons” of the trust as defined under the  act “independent trustees”     table of contents  statement of additional information    additional information concerning the board of trustees the role of the board the board oversees the management and operations of the trust  like all mutual funds the daytoday management and operation of the trust is the responsibility of the various service providers to the trust such as the advisor the distributor the administrator the custodian and the transfer agent each of whom are discussed in greater detail in this statement of additional information  in addition the advisor provides regular reports on the investment strategy and performance of the fund  the board has appointed a chief compliance officer who administers the trust’s compliance program and regularly reports to the board as to compliance matters  these reports are provided as part of formal “board meetings” which are typically held quarterly in person and involve the board’s review of recent operations  in addition various members of the board also meet with management in less formal settings between formal “board meetings” to discuss various topics  in all cases however the role of the board and of any individual trustee is one of oversight and not of management of the daytoday affairs of the trust and its oversight role does not make the board a guarantor of the trust’s investments operations or activities board structure leadership the board has structured itself in a manner that it believes allows it to perform its oversight function effectively  it has established three standing committees a nominating committee a valuation committe and an audit committee which are discussed in greater detail below under “trust committees”  a majority of the board is comprised of trustees who are independent trustees which are trustees that are not affiliated with the advisor the principal underwriter or their affiliates  the chairman of the board is an interested trustee  the board has determined not to combine the chairman position and the principal executive officer position of the trust the board reviews its structure and the structure of its committees annually  the board has determined that the structure of the interested chairman the composition of the board and the function and composition of its various committees are appropriate means to address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise board oversight of risk management as part of its oversight function the board of trustees is responsible for reviewing the advisor’s risk management policies and procedures  because risk management is a broad concept comprised of many elements  eg investment risk issuer and counterparty risk compliance risk operational risks business continuity risks etc the oversight of different types of risks is handled in different ways  for example the audit committee meets with the treasurer and the trust’s independent registered public accounting firm to discuss among other things the internal control structure of the trust’s financial reporting function  the board meets with the chief compliance officer to discuss compliance and operational risks and how they are managed  the board will also review as appropriate reports regarding risk management activities of service providers  in addition to these reports from time to time the board receives reports from the administrator and the advisor as to enterprise risk management information about each trustee’s qualification experience attributes or skills the board believes that each of the trustees has the qualifications experience attributes and skills “trustee attributes” appropriate to their continued service as trustees of the trust in light of the trust’s business and structure  the trustees have substantial investment and business experience and in some cases have served previously on public company boards of directors  they have substantial board experience and in their service to the trust have gained substantial insight as to the operation of the trust  the board annually conducts a “selfassessment” wherein the effectiveness of the board and individual trustees is reviewed     table of contents  statement of additional information    in addition to the information provided in the chart below is certain additional information concerning each particular trustee and hisher trustee attributes  the information is not allinclusive  many trustee attributes involve intangible elements such as

also serves as the qualified legal compliance committee “qlcc” and performs the role of certain legal and compliance activities the nominating committee is responsible for seeking and reviewing candidates for consideration as nominees for trustees and meets only as necessary  the nominating committee will consider nominees nominated by shareholders  recommendations by shareholders for consideration by the nominating committee should be sent to the president of the trust in writing together with the appropriate biographical information concerning each such proposed nominee and such recommendation must comply with the notice provisions set forth in the trust bylaws  in general to comply with such procedures such nominations together with all required biographical information must be delivered to and received by the president of the trust at the principal executive offices of the trust no later than  days and no more than  days prior to the shareholder meeting at which any such nominee would be voted on the audit committee is comprised entirely of all of the independent trustees  the audit committee generally meets on a quarterly basis with respect to the various series of

audit or the fund’s financial statements and to ensure the integrity of the fund’s pricing and financial reporting  in addition the audit committee will also serve as the qualified legal compliance committee additionally the board has delegated daytoday valuation issues to a valuation committee that is comprised of the trust’s chairman president and secretary and is overseen by the trustees  the

transactions pursuant to the advisory agreement the advisor determines which securities are to be purchased and sold by the fund and which brokerdealers are eligible to execute the fund’s portfolio transactions  purchases and sales of securities in the overthecounter market will generally be executed directly with a “marketmaker” unless in the opinion of the advisor a better price and execution can otherwise be obtained by using a broker for the transaction purchases of portfolio securities for the fund also may be made directly from issuers or from underwriters  where possible purchase and sale transactions will be effected through dealers including banks that specialize in the types of securities which the fund will be holding unless better executions are available elsewhere  dealers and underwriters usually act as principal for their own accounts  purchases from underwriters will include a concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter and purchases from dealers will include the spread between the bid and the asked price  if the execution and price offered by more than one dealer or underwriter are comparable the order may be allocated to a dealer or underwriter that has provided research or other services as discussed below in placing portfolio transactions the advisor will seek best execution  the full range and quality of services will be considered in making this determination such as the size of the order the difficulty of execution the operational facilities of the firm involved the firm’s risk and experience in positioning a block of securities and other factors  in those instances where it is reasonably determined that more than one brokerdealer can offer the best execution the advisor considers such information which is in addition to and not in lieu of the services required to be performed by it under the advisory agreement with the fund to be useful in varying degrees but of indeterminable value  portfolio transactions may be placed with brokerdealers who sell shares of the fund subject to rules adopted by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” and the sec while it is the advisor’s general policy to seek best execution in selecting a brokerdealer to execute portfolio transactions for the fund in accordance with section e under the securities and exchange act of  as amended weight is also given to the ability of a brokerdealer to facilitate a particular trade or to furnish brokerage and research services to the fund or to the advisor even if the specific services are not directly useful to the fund and may be useful to the advisor in advising other clients  in negotiating commissions with a broker or evaluating the spread to be paid to a dealer the fund may therefore pay a higher commission or spread than would be the case if no weight were given to the furnishing of these supplemental services provided that the amount of such commission or spread has been determined in good faith by the advisor to be reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage andor research services provided by such brokerdealer  additionally in accordance with procedures adopted by the trust the advisor may direct transactions to a brokerdealer with which it has an affiliation     table of contents  statement of additional information    often identical securities will be acceptable for both the fund and one or more of the advisor’s client accounts or mutual funds  in such event the position of the fund and such client accounts or mutual funds in the same issuer may vary and the length of time that each may choose to hold its investment in the same issuer may likewise vary  however to the extent any of these client accounts or mutual funds seeks to acquire the same security as the fund at the same time the fund may not be able to acquire as large a portion of such security as it desires or it may have to pay a higher price or obtain a lower yield for such security  similarly the fund may not be able to obtain as high a price for or as large an execution of an order to sell any particular security at the same time  if one or more of such client accounts or mutual funds simultaneously purchases or sells the same security that the fund is purchasing or selling each day’s transactions in such security will be allocated between the fund and all such client accounts or mutual funds in a manner deemed equitable by the advisor taking into account the respective sizes of the accounts and the amount being purchased or sold  it is recognized that in some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security insofar as the fund is concerned  in other cases however it is believed that the ability of the fund to participate in volume transactions may produce better executions for the fund the fund does not effect securities transactions through brokers in accordance with any formula nor does it effect securities transactions through brokers for selling shares of the fund  however as stated above brokerdealers who execute brokerage transactions may effect purchases of shares of the fund for its customers the predecessor fund did not own any securities of its regular brokerdealers during the fiscal year ended november   with the exception that it owned shares in leucadia national corporation the parent of jefferies llc to whom the fund

fiscal year ended november           fiscal year ended november     fiscal year ended november      the increase in the aggregate brokerage commission from  to  is a result of higher portfolio turnover and higher average assets primarily related to increased activity to meet shareholder redemptions  the increase in the aggregate brokerage commission from  to  is due to additional investment transactions following an increase in fund assets resulting from net shareholder subscriptions  as a percentage of average assets the advisor believes that commission activity was comparable to the

contents  statement of additional information    for foreign securities traded on foreign exchanges the trust has selected ft interactive data “ftid” to provide pricing data with respect to foreign security holdings held by the fund  the use of this thirdparty pricing service is designed to capture events occurring after a foreign exchange closes that may affect the value of certain holdings of the fund’s securities traded on those foreign exchanges  the fund utilizes a confidence interval when determining the use of the ftid provided prices  the confidence interval is a measure of the historical relationship that each foreign exchange traded security has compared to movements in various indices and the price of the security’s corresponding adr if one exists  ftid provides the confidence interval for each security for which it provides a price  if the ftid provided price falls within the confidence interval the fund will value the particular security at that price if the ftid provided price does not fall within the confidence interval the particular security will be valued at the preceding closing price on its respective foreign exchange or if there were no transactions on such day at the mean between the bid and asked prices all other assets of the fund are valued in such manner as the board in good faith deems appropriate to reflect their fair value

of qualifying dividends received by the fund for its taxable year   in view of the fund’s investment policies it is expected that dividends from domestic corporations will be part of the fund’s gross income and that accordingly part of the distributions by the fund may be eligible for treatment as qualified income for individual shareholders and for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporate shareholders  however the portion of the fund’s gross income attributable to qualifying dividends is largely dependent on the fund’s investment activities for a particular year and therefore cannot be predicted with any certainty   the deduction if any may be reduced or eliminated if fund shares held by an individual investor are held less than  days or if fund shares held by a corporate investor are treated as debtfinanced or are held for fewer than  days     table of contents  statement of additional information    any long term capital gain distributions are taxable to shareholders as long term capital gains regardless of the length of time they have held their shares  capital gains distributions are not eligible for the dividends received deduction referred to in the previous paragraph   there is no requirement that the fund take into consideration any tax implications when implementing its investment strategy   distributions of any ordinary income and net realized capital gains will be taxable as described above whether received in shares or in cash  shareholders who choose to receive distributions in the form of additional shares will have a cost basis for federal income tax purposes in each share so received equal to the nav of a share on the reinvestment date  distributions are generally taxable when received  however distributions declared in october november or december to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and paid the following january are taxable as if received on december   distributions are includable in alternative minimum taxable income in computing a shareholder’s liability for the alternative minimum tax  shareholders should note that the fund may make taxable distributions of income and capital gains even when share values have declined  a dividend or distribution paid shortly after a purchase of shares by a shareholder would represent in substance a partial return of capital to the extent it is paid on the shares so purchased even though it would be subject to income taxes the fund may be subject to foreign withholding taxes on dividends and interest earned with respect to securities of foreign corporations under the code the fund will be required to report to the internal revenue service “irs” all distributions of ordinary income and capital gains as well as gross proceeds from the redemption or exchange of portfolio shares except in the case of exempt shareholders which includes most corporations  pursuant to the backup withholding provisions of the code distributions of any taxable income and capital gains and proceeds from the redemption of portfolio shares may be subject to withholding of federal income tax at the current rate of  in the case of nonexempt shareholders who fail to furnish the fund with their correct taxpayer identification numbers and with required certifications regarding their status under the federal income tax law or if the irs notifies the fund that such backup withholding is required  if the withholding provisions are applicable any such distributions and proceeds whether taken in cash or reinvested in additional shares will be reduced by the amounts required to be withheld  corporate and other exempt shareholders should provide the fund with their taxpayer identification numbers or certify their exempt status in order to avoid possible erroneous application of backup withholding  backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against a shareholder’s ultimate federal income tax liability if proper documentation is provided  the fund reserves the right to refuse to open an account for any person failing to provide a certified taxpayer identification number if more than  in value of the fund’s total assets at the end of its fiscal year is invested in stock or securities of foreign corporations the fund may elect to pass through to its shareholders the pro rata share of all foreign income taxes paid by the fund subject to certain exceptions for fund of funds structures  if this election is made shareholders will be  required to include in their gross income their pro rata share of the fund’s foreign source income including any foreign income taxes paid by the fund and  entitled either to deduct their share of such foreign taxes in computing their taxable income or to claim a credit for such taxes against their us income tax subject to certain limitations under the code including certain holding period requirements  in this case shareholders will be informed in writing by the fund at the end of each calendar year regarding the availability of any credits on and the amount of foreign source income including or excluding foreign income taxes paid by the fund to be included in their income tax returns  if not more than  in value of the fund’s total assets at the end of its fiscal year is invested in stock or securities of foreign corporations the fund will not be entitled under the code to pass through to its shareholders their pro rata share of the foreign taxes paid by the fund subject to certain exceptions for fund of funds structures  in this case these taxes will be taken as a deduction by the fund     table of contents  statement of additional information    the use of hedging strategies such as entering into forward contracts involves complex rules that will determine the character and timing of recognition of the income received in connection therewith by the fund  income from foreign currencies except certain gains therefrom that may be excluded by future regulations and income from transactions in forward contracts derived by the fund with respect to its business of investing in securities or foreign currencies will generally qualify as permissible income under subchapter m of the code any security or other position entered into or held by the fund that substantially diminishes the fund’s risk of loss from any other position held by the fund may constitute a “straddle” for federal income tax purposes  in general straddles are subject to certain rules that may affect the amount character and timing of the fund’s gains and losses with respect to straddle positions by requiring among other things that the loss realized on disposition of one position of a straddle be deferred until gain is realized on disposition of the offsetting position that the fund’s holding period in certain straddle positions not begin until the straddle is terminated possibly resulting in the gain being treated as short–term capital gain rather than long–term capital gain and that losses recognized with respect to certain straddle positions which would otherwise constitute short–term capital losses be treated as long–term capital losses  different elections are available to the fund that may mitigate the effects of the straddle rules certain forward contracts that are subject to section  of the code “section  contracts” and that are held by the fund at the end of its taxable year generally will be required to be “markedtomarket” for federal income tax purposes that is deemed to have been sold at market value  sixty percent of any net gain or loss recognized on these deemed sales and  of any net gain or loss realized from any actual sales of section  contracts will be treated as long–term capital gain or loss and the balance will be treated as short–term capital gain or loss section  of the code contains special tax rules applicable to certain foreign currency transactions that may affect the amount timing and character of income gain or loss recognized by the fund   under these rules foreign exchange gain or loss realized with respect to foreign currency forward contracts is treated as ordinary income or loss  some part of the fund’s gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of shares of a foreign corporation may because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates be treated as ordinary income or loss under section  of the code rather than as capital gain or loss distributions and the transactions referred to in the preceding paragraphs may be subject to state and local income taxes and the tax treatment thereof may differ from the federal income tax treatment the foregoing discussion of us federal income tax law relates solely to the application of that law to us citizens or residents and us domestic corporations partnerships trusts and estates  each shareholder who is not a us person should consider the us and foreign tax consequences of ownership of shares of the fund  including the possibility that such a shareholder may be subject to a us withholding tax at a rate of  percent or at a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty on the fund’s distributions the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca”   a  withholding tax on the fund’s distributions including capital gains distributions and on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of shares of the fund generally applies if paid to a foreign entity unless  i if the foreign entity is a “foreign financial institution” it undertakes certain due diligence reporting withholding and certification obligations ii if the foreign entity is not a “foreign financial institution” it identifies certain of its us investors or iii the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under fatca  withholding under fatca is required  i with respect to certain distributions from the fund and ii with respect to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of fund shares that occur on or after january    if withholding is required under fatca on a payment related to your shares investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the irs to obtain the benefits of such exemption or reduction  the fund will not pay any additional amounts in respect to amounts withheld under fatca  you should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of fatca based on your individual circumstances     table of contents  statement of additional information    in addition the foregoing discussion of tax law is based on existing provisions of the code existing and proposed regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions all of which are subject to change  any such changes could affect the validity of this discussion  the discussion also represents only a general summary of tax law and practice currently applicable to the fund and certain shareholders therein and as such is subject to change  in particular the consequences of an investment in shares of the fund under the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdictions are not discussed herein  each prospective investor should consult his or her own tax advisor to determine the application of the tax law and practice to his or her own particular circumstances  the fund will not receive an opinion from counsel or a ruling from the irs with respect to the tax issues discussed herein the advice herein was prepared for the fund  any person reviewing this discussion should seek advice based on such person’s particular circumstances from an independent tax

the annual report for the predecessor fund for the fiscal year ended november   is a separate document provided upon request and the financial statements accompanying notes and report of the independent registered public accounting firm appearing therein are incorporated by reference into this sai     table of contents  statement of additional information    appendix a commercial paper ratings standard  poor’s a standard  poor’s commercial paper rating is a current assessment of the likelihood of timely payment of debt having an original maturity of no more than  days  ratings are graded into several categories ranging from ‘a’ for the highestquality obligations to ‘d’ for the lowest  these categories are as follows a  this designation indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely payment is strong  those issues determined to possess extremely strong safety characteristics are denoted with a plus sign  designation a  capacity for timely payment on issues with this designation is satisfactory  however the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues designated ‘a’ a  issues carrying this designation have an adequate capacity for timely payment  they are however more vulnerable to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances than obligations carrying the higher designations b  issues rated ‘b’ are regarded as having only speculative capacity for timely payment c  this rating is assigned to shortterm debt obligations with a doubtful capacity for payment d – debt rated ‘d’ is in payment default  the ‘d’ rating category is used when interest payments of principal payments are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poor’s believes such payments will be made during such grace period moody’s moody’s shortterm debt ratings are opinions on the ability of issuers to punctually repay senior debt obligations  these obligations have an original maturity not exceeding one year unless explicitly noted  moody’s employs the following three designations all judged to be investment grade to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers prime  issuers rated prime or supporting institutions have a superior ability for repayment of senior shortterm debt obligations  prime repayment ability will often be evidenced by many of the following characteristics  leading market positions in wellestablished industries high rates of return on funds employed conservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt and ample asset protection broad margins in earnings coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal cash generation and wellestablished access to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity prime  issuers rated prime or supporting institutions have a strong ability for repayment of senior shortterm debt obligations  this will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree  earnings trends and coverage ratios while sound may be more subject to variation  capitalization characteristics while still appropriate may be more affected by external conditions  ample alternate liquidity is maintained     table of contents  statement of additional information    prime  issuers rated prime or supporting institutions have an acceptable ability for repayment of senior shortterm debt obligations  the effect of industry characteristics and market compositions may be more pronounced  variability in earnings and profitability may result in changes in the level of debt protection measurements and may require relatively high financial leverage  adequate alternate liquidity is maintained not prime  issuers rated not prime do not fall within any of the prime rating categories credit ratings standard  poor’s standard  poor’s issue credit ratings based in varying degrees on the following considerations    likelihood of payment – capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation    nature of and provisions of the obligation and    protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors’ rights the issue ratings definitions are expressed in terms of default risk  as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity  junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above aaa  an obligation rated “aaa” has the highest rating assigned by standard  poor’s  the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa  an obligation rated “aa” differs from the highest rated obligations only in small degree  the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong a  an obligation rated “a” is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories  however the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbb  an obligation rated “bbb” exhibits adequate protection parameters  however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation bb b ccc cc and c  obligations rated “bb” “b” “ccc” “cc” and “c” are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics  “bb” indicates the least degree of speculation and “c” the highest  while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb  an obligation rated “bb” is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues  however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b  an obligation rated “b” is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated “bb” but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation     table of contents  statement of additional information    ccc  an obligation rated “ccc” is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cc  an obligation rated “cc” is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment c  the “c” rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken but payments on this obligation are being continued d  an obligation rated “d” is in payment default  the “d” rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poor’s believes that such payments will be made during such grace period  the “d” rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized plus  or minus  the ratings from “aa” through “ccc” may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories “c”  the ‘c’ subscript is used to provide additional information to investors that the bank may terminate its obligation to purchase tendered bonds if the longterm credit rating of the issuer is below an investmentgrade level andor the issuer’s bonds are deemed taxable “p”  the letter ‘p’ indicates that the rating is provisional  a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful timely completion of the project  this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion  the investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk   continuance of the ratings is contingent upon standard  poor’s receipt of an executed copy of the escrow agreement or closing documentation confirming investments and cash flows “r” the ‘r’ highlights derivative hybrid and certain other obligations that standard  poor’s believes may experience high volatility or high variability in expected returns as a result of noncredit risks examples of such obligations are securities with principal or interest return indexed to equities commodities or currencies certain swaps and options and interestonly and principalonly mortgage securities the absence of an ‘r’ symbol should not be taken as an indication that an obligation will exhibit no volatility or variability in total return nr  not rated  debt obligations of issuers outside the united states and its territories are rated on the same basis as domestic corporate and municipal issues  the ratings measure the creditworthiness of the obligor but do not take into account currency exchange and related uncertainties     table of contents  statement of additional information    moody’s moody’s uses the following categories for longterm obligations aaa  bonds that are rated “aaa” are to be of the best quality  they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as “gilt edged”  interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure  while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aa  bonds that are rated “aa” are judged to be of high quality by all standards  together with the “aaa” group they comprise what are generally known as highgrade bonds  they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in “aaa” securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risk appear somewhat larger than the “aaa” securities a  bonds that are rated “a” possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as uppermediumgrade obligations  factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baa  bonds that are rated “baa” are considered mediumgrade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured  interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time  such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well ba  bonds that are rated “ba” are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured  often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future  uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class b  bonds that are rated “b” generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment  assurance of interest and principal payments or maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small caa  bonds that are rated “caa” are of poor standing  such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest ca  bonds that are rated “ca” represent obligations that are speculative in a high degree  such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings c – bonds that are rated “c” are the lowest rated class of bonds and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any
