change in sales included a  increase in organic volume a  increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions and a  decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation compared to the prior years first quarter looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment within the adhesive dispensing segment organic sales volume increased  as compared to the prior year first quarter offset by  negative impact related to currency translation this is solid growth against a challenging comparison of the prior year first quarter where organic growth was  in this segment our product assembly and rigid packaging product lines drove the growth in the current quarter on a geographic basis asia pacific the americas and japan were strongest sales volume in the advanced technology segment increased  over the prior year first quarter inclusive of a  increase in organic volume and a  increase related to the first year effect of the linktech and ace acquisitions the growth was offset by  negative impact related to currency translation all product lines and geographies in the segment delivered excellent organic growth most by double digits with performance aided in part by comparison to a softer first quarter in some end markets a yearago organic sales volume in the industrial coating segment increased  compared to the first quarter yearago offset by a  negative impact related to currency translation growth was strong in nearly all regions and was led by demand for our cold material dispensing powder coating and uv curing product lines gross margin for the total company in the first quarter was  a  percentage point improvement compared to the prior year first quarter driven by volume leverage and favorable mix operating profit in the quarter was  million and operating margin was  a  percentage point improvement over the first quarter a year ago incremental operating margin on the increased volume was  within the adhesive dispensing segment

the first quarter an increase of  percentage points over the same period a year ago and within the industrial coating segment reported operating margin was  in the first quarter an improvement of  percentage points over the same period a year ago this strong performance overall given the seasonally lower first quarter volume that is typical for all three of our segments volume leverage favorable mix and continuous improvement initiatives enabled all three segments to deliver operating margin improvement for the company net income for the quarter was  million gaap diluted earnings per share were   higher than last years first quarter weve included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between gaap earnings and normalized earnings per

the prior year positive order rates in packaging and product assembly were offset by softness in other product lines geographically positive orders in the americas were offset by flat to slightly down rates in other regions timing of larger dollar system orders can have an effect on order rates and for most of this latest week period order rates in the adhesive segment have been up midtohigh singledigits over the same period a year ago in the advanced technology segment order rates for the latest  weeks are up  as compared to the prior year these order rates reflect strong demand for

health market and broader exposure to the diy pesticide and dental markets the company has averaged high singledigit annual revenue growth over the last five years and had  revenues of approximately

medical device oems and emerging innovators around the world vention at brings many complementary capabilities to our existing nordson medical offering such as complex extrusion balloon and catheter manufacturing nitinol forming and other specialty material expertise they have one of the largest design and development teams in the industry which provide full service solutions to customers from concept design and prototyping quality and regulatory support to finish device assembly supporting some of the most complex and innovative interventional and advanced surgical procedures performed in healthcare today vention at also strengthens and expands our relationships with medical device oem customers where we will now be able to provide a broader array of solutions across a wider range of highgrowth therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular electrophysiology peripheral vascular urology and neurovascular among others finally the acquisition clearly aligns with the medical growth strategy we have previously articulated and follows the other successful acquisitions we have made since  to build our current nordson medical platform including value plastics micromedics linktech quick couplings and avalon catheters we see vention at as an ideal complement to our current offering which includes singleuse fluid management components biomaterial delivery devices and highend cannula and tubing we estimate the total addressable market for the combination of nordson medical and vention at to be in excess of  billion and growing at a high singledigit low doubledigit rate we expect the vention at transaction to close by the end of our second quarter we look forward to bringing our combined capabilities to the many leading medical device oem customers we currently share and expanding our reach to new customers with that ill now turn the call over to greg to address additional financial aspects of these acquisitions gregory a thaxton  nordson corp thank you jeff as with the plaspak acquisition we expect vention at to enhance nordsons top and bottomline growth and be accretive to total company ebitda margins vention at sales for the  months ended january   were approximately  million with ebitda of  million  million purchase price represents an ebitda multiple of  times in line with similar multiples paid for other high quality properties in the medical space initial identified cost synergies are modest and in the range of approximately  million including these benefits the purchase price represents a synergized ebitda multiple of  times assuming a close on vention at during our second fiscal quarter we expect  to  accretion to eps in fiscal year  from all four acquisitions including estimated purchase accounting charges once we close and get further into our valuation work on purchase price allocation well provide further updates on expected eps accretion the vention at deal will be funded with cash and debt our net debt to ebitda is approximately  times at the end of the first quarter based on our guidance for the second quarter and including trailing  month ebitda for these four acquisitions our net debt to ebitda is forecasted at approximately  times after close as we have demonstrated historically our consistent levels of cash flow allow us to delever quickly michael f hilton  nordson corp thank you jeff and greg i want to welcome all the employees of ace interselect and plaspak and upon close vention medical at to nordson we look forward to growing these great businesses in the months and years ahead from an overall perspective nordson is firing on all cylinders right now thanks to the hard work of our team and the value we bring to our customers we are executing on our growth strategy and the various initiatives we have to drive continuous improvement across the company with that well be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator and our first question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc capital your line is open jeffrey hammond  keybanc capital markets inc hey good morning guys michael f hilton  nordson corp good morning jeff gregory a thaxton  nordson corp good morning jeffrey hammond  keybanc capital markets inc hey congratulation on this deal just can you walk through where you see the synergies the  million and then just talk about where there is kind of the greatest customer overlap and i think you mentioned kind of international opportunities just kind of touch on all those synergies thanks michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah ill just make a couple of comments the synergy level is relatively modest as this is sort of a fourth pillar to our platform from a medical device standpoint obviously there will be some wed see from the leverage of our procurement capability and then maybe some other cost improvement opportunities we havent included any revenue synergies here although we do think and we have shown in the past that weve been able to demonstrate incremental topline revenue by crossselling across our product lines with the relationships that we have with key oems as far as the specifics on the customer side this is a relatively concentrated group of oem customers and what this does for us is give us access to essentially all of the large oem customers but at the same time this business has done a nice job with – through the emerging innovators and it gives us access to the broader part of our product line to some of these emerging innovators so thats an interesting opportunity and then as you said a lot of the big customers are global and can help translate this business more globally so we feel pretty good about the position of the business jeffrey hammond  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then just a quick followup here on advanced tech can you just give us an update on what youre seeing from a quoting activity customer tone standpoint as you kind of enter this more seasonally strong maybe just comment on what youre seeing from the chinese oems automation wise anything around major smartphone upgrades thatd be helpful thanks michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah i would say lets sort of split this up into a couple of buckets on the electronics side of the business were clearly seeing our approach to diversification playing out here so yeah were seeing good interest from the local mobile guys in china but we also have more applications that go to in the automobile electronics space and some of these new additions that weve added give us an even bigger footprint there on that automotive electronics space but were also seeing good penetration because of our new products into that wafer related processing both the deposition through asymtek and the inspection part of the business as well so kind of what the story weve seen over the last few quarters is continuing there we do see a lot of interest at least in terms of project activity on the mobile side again at this point in time you never know which ones of those are really going to come forward and then if you look at the other part of the business in our fluid management business were seeing solid business in a lot of general industry applications fluid formulators as well as activity in the electronicsrelated space and then on medical were seeing strong opportunities in our medical business related to our new products and our broadening product line there so pretty solid activity across the board now also were up against that point of time where we start to see the business pickup orders pickup so we do have as the year goes on for comps in the business as well jeffrey hammond  keybanc capital markets inc thanks mike operator and our next question comes from liam burke with wunderlich your line is open liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc thank you good morning mike good morning greg michael f hilton  nordson corp good morning liam gregory a thaxton  nordson corp good morning liam liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc mike could we go over to the adhesives and could you give us some color on how the polymer business has been doing michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah so on the adhesives side of the business the parts of the business that supports sort of consumerrelated products food and beverage other consumer related products like packaging are doing well our product assembly business is strong nonwoven business is a little soft but thats against a really strong comparison last year as you look at our polymer area our dies business has picked up as the extrusion business has started to improve we are seeing a little softness in the injection molding area as we see some of the things like the auto business maybe start to slow down from a growth perspective a little bit but in our melt delivery and our pelletizing business we expect to see this be a solid year although maybe a little lumpy because particularly the pelletizing piece tends to be very projectspecific so id say the business is improving not quite as robust as wed like to see but improving liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc okay thank you and on the vention acquisition you mentioned there was discussion of the customer overlap or nonoverlap is there any leveragability on the rd front or on the production front michael f hilton  nordson corp id say on the production front down the road there could be on the rd side i think its complementary capability but at this point we havent factor that in jeff i dont know if you want to comment anymore on that jeffrey alan pembroke  nordson corp yeah i would just say on the manufacturing front one of the things that this acquisition brings us is a new position into complex extrusion balloon blowing and manufacturing and nitinol forming some other things so its really complementary to what we do today with some very specialized facilities that they have so probably not so much on the manufacturing side on the design and front end there are certain aspects of how we design products across the different medical product platforms that we can take advantage of envelope technology from one area and use it in other so we do think theres some opportunity there liam d burke  wunderlich securities inc great thank you operator and our next question comes from charley brady with suntrust your line is open charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hi thanks good morning guys michael f hilton  nordson corp good morning charley charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc on this acquisition of vention you guys have talked about getting life sciences platform to  million  million size this certainly jumps at really closely to the bottomend of that market im just wondering it is guys obviously another piece of the business you really werent into minimally invasive technologies as you add this pieces of business are there additional tackon pieces to the one you just did that further broadens up the capabilities or as we look to life science ma this kind of it for a while youre going to focus on other areas in terms of ma michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah so let me make a couple of comments charley so first of all we feel like were getting a lot of capability with this particular acquisition and particularly as you mentioned in the minimally invasive space which is probably the highest growth space within the medical device marketplace so we like that that said across all of our businesses in the medical space theres still a degree of fragmentation there theres still a fair bit of work thats done inhouse from the oems that trend continues to outsource that so we see good organic growth opportunities and we do see opportunities to add additional capability down the road but obviously this is a sizable scale play for us and puts us well on the way to getting this business to something that down the road could be a  billion business for us charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc right but i just want to go back in your prepared remarks on the orders for adhesive dispensing i wasnt sure if i heard correctly you talked about i think the tenure of orders through the quarter or through the  weeks they had obviously ended up at  weeks down  but i thought i heard you say that for the majority of the time they were actually up could you just clarify that michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah when you do the sort of pointtopoint analysis you can have a real strong week dropoff and thats basically what were seeing and we think theres some timing around the yearonyear comparisons well so we had solid orders and sort of in the last week we had a period of time where we had some very large orders last year that dropped out of that comparison so we feel pretty good about what we see as i said across the businesses in terms of interest particularly in the consumer nondurable related space it was our packaging as i said this year the nonwovens area is going to be a little bit of a challenge because we have such a strong year last year with a lot of recapitalization but we feel pretty good about the opportunities and prospects that said its still an uncertain global kind of environment here and so we feel pretty good about the opportunities that we see gregory a thaxton  nordson corp and charley just to put a little more color on that it also highlights in that segment weve got some larger dollar product lines so as those orders come in in one given week if that happens to be a week that dropsoff for an incoming week it could impact that total week view but again the comment was to suggest if you look on a weekbyweek basis within that  weeks order rates were pretty robust charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc yeah okay thats the point i was actually trying to just clarify so that is very helpful and just one more for me did you guys give a gross margin forecast for the second quarter gregory a thaxton  nordson corp yeah we did an operating margin michael f hilton  nordson corp gross margin gregory a thaxton  nordson corp gross margin we suggest it would be  in the quarter charles brady  suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thank you operator and our next question comes from matt summerville of alembic global advisors your line is open matt j summerville  alembic global advisors llc thanks good morning i want to talk about michael f hilton  nordson corp hi matt matt j summerville  alembic global advisors llc vention again for a moment can you talk about you mentioned the  billion sort of tam for your core nordson medical if you will and then the recent acquisitions sort of combined including vention how big is ventions addressable market as a subset of that and can you speak directly to the competitive environment who the players are what the relative market share position looks like michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah so ill let jeff probably add some color to that but getting into the minimally invasive space dramatically increases the available market to us so probably twothirds of that  billion really falls into that minimally invasive space at a high level there are a couple of key competitors there is a company called integer thats a competitor in this space and then tes creganna business is a competitor in this space we feel good about our full capability from a solutions provider standpoint there is a bunch of smaller folks out there so opportunities for the future and then theres a still a fair bit of work thats done inhouse by large oems but the trend continues to be to outsource that and focus more on the end device jeff i dont know whether you want to add any additional color there jeffrey alan pembroke  nordson corp yeah so mike i think you had it right from that addressable market that we quantified about twothirds of that would be in the vention area really related to minimally invasive interventional delivery devices and those sorts of things the total outsource market for medical device oems is in excess of  billion so were only talking about a portion of that which is really the highly engineered differentiated piece and as mike mentioned earlier in the call there is additional opportunity that the oems continue to do inhouse that more and more increasingly is being outsourced and from a competitor standpoint mike mentioned a couple that we would see a directly against vention at the market remains fairly fragmented as well with several other competitors out there as well matt j summerville  alembic global advisors llc and then just a couple of followups on just sticking with vention it looks like about a month ago vention completed an acquisition of a nitinol wire manufacturer can you speak to the significance of that acquisition what that technology adds to vention and then whether these products or even mike maybe in core nordson medical to the extent anything thats being done here falls under some sort of federal regulatory umbrella thank you jeffrey alan pembroke  nordson corp yeah mike you want me to take that michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah go ahead jeffrey alan pembroke  nordson corp yeah so what youll find in these types of businesses that are technology based a lot of the differentiation comes from your ability to manufacture convert and design around very specialty materials and so the addition of nitinol to ventions capabilities nickel titanium which is basically a very biocompatible material with shape memory so it can be used transcatheter you can shape it get it through a catheter arrive at a point and it goes back to its original shape to perform the function that it was meant to perform so its a material that is becoming more widely used in medical devices and so the acquisition that vention made was a company that has unique ability in forming nitinol into very complex shapes so we do see that as a significant capability that we could take and expand to other applications and other customers as it relates to the regulatory and fda so vention would be subject to similar levels of regulatory risk and fda burden that we experience in some of our current nordson medical business today ventions liability is limited to the extent they do not own k or device registrations but theyre subject to standard medical device quality standards and manufacturing practices which are audited from time to time by the fda however this is common and something that again we experience today within parts of our nordson medical business matt j summerville  alembic global advisors llc appreciate the color thank you operator and our next question comes from chris dankert with longbow research your line is open josh l zaret  longbow research llc hi guys this is actually josh in for chris thanks for taking my call and congrats on the quarter and the recent flurry of ma i guess the first one we have is – so vention looks like a huge win at a really accretive price so i guess are there any other medical deals out there that have a similar scale to vention and such accretive margins or is this sort of a unicorn michael f hilton  nordson corp well i would say in terms of the margin side our focus is really on differentiated capability and so everything that were looking to acquire in this space whether its the minimally invasive space that were talking about here or the other products that weve already acquired its around being able to differentiate capabilities so that you can provide the right solution for customers create value and get paid for it so there are other opportunities out there that we continue to look at across all of the product lines within our medical business i think this is a nice move from a scale perspective there may be some others out there – theres certainly things that were interested in but really not in a point to talk about anything right now so id say theres more opportunity this is a good move from us from a scale point but more importantly from the capability that it gives us the market segment that it opens up to us in a big way and the ability to kind of reinforce the broader capability we have with a consistent group of customers josh l zaret  longbow research llc okay perfect and i guess the follow up over into ads it seems like things has slowed a bit in emea any color you could provide there or is this just a oneoff or youve seen anything slowing expackaging there michael f hilton  nordson corp as i said i think in this particular quarter as you look at the order rates its more probably larger project related kind of thing than anything else what i would say is across the board the sort of consumer nondurable space looks solid right now and thats why packaging looks solid theres some good opportunities in the product assembly area that looks solid nonwovens is operating at a high level but its got a really tough comp last year we did get a number of significant recapitalization so its got a tough comp there id say our dies businesses are improving were starting to see our core components pick up as well as the melt delivery in terms of opportunities out there palletizing is lumpy but we think it will be a good year but its going to lumpy so id say the big project mix is the one thing thats hard to predict and thats the one area that can move things around thats both in say product assembly and some of the lesser extent nonwovens i mean and some things like palletizing so we think the opportunities are good weve got tough comparables in that business josh l zaret  longbow research llc all right perfect thanks operator and our next question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo your line is open allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc yeah hi guys good morning michael f hilton  nordson corp good morning allison gregory a thaxton  nordson corp good morning allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc with the incremental additions including vention how should we think about the seasonality with that ats business i imagine its a bit more smooth than its been historically going forward michael f hilton  nordson corp id say on the seasonality yeah probably a little bit but if you think about it were still going to see the kind of holiday effects that we see in most of our businesses in the first quarter so id say seasonality wise theres probably a little improvement obviously from a cyclicality standpoint its part of a specific strategy that we have to try and balance out that segment where we have more cyclicality in the electronics related parts of the business allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc great and then on etfs i guess just in this optimism of the trump administration right now i know youve talked about backlog and orders but in terms of inquiries have you seen sort of a mix towards these larger projects starting to come through particularly if you look to the us there are no change there yet just any thoughts on that michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah i would say weve not seen any dramatic change associated with the proposed policies that the president has talked about but for some bigger projects it would take a little longer for those to materialize anyway i mean i think when you look at something for example like the auto industry we kind of supported wherever it is so they move from place to place but we generally view that as an opportunity and one of the stronger sort of end markets but we havent really seen anything that we could identify as an uptick associated with the proposed policies allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator and our next question comes from walter liptak with seaport global your line is open walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc hi thanks good morning guys gregory a thaxton  nordson corp good morning walt michael f hilton  nordson corp good morning walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc i want to ask you about the vention medical acquisition and i wonder if you can help us understand a little bit more about how the business was organized and the part of the business that you didnt acquire and i guess it was for sale so why didnt you acquire are there any relationships that are going to be continuing from that either way as a supply relationship et cetera michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah so ill just make a couple of high level comments i mean the overall vention business was put together through a series of acquisitions some more focused on id say the service side of the business and some more focused on through the technology side of the business and the owners in the process decided to split this up into sort of two pieces and as we said before we like the position where you have the opportunity to be a solutions provider to the customer where youve got differentiated capability and we certainly saw that in the vention at business and thats why we were most interested in that particular business there will be modest ongoing relationship between the two businesses and contracts to cover that but its not significant in terms of the total so they operated as fairly independent businesses walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc okay great and so the manufacturing locate theyre not going to be contract manufacturing for vention at michael f hilton  nordson corp no theres some products that go back and forth its a very de minimis amount and well have agreements in place to address those but its not significant there are – as jeff had mentioned theres certain capabilities with each of these sites that are important and quite frankly the locations are important from medical device particularly frontend design standpoint so we really like the locations that we have and the presence we have in sort of the hot bed  markets of the medical design space walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc okay great and then switching gears back to adhesives i wonder if you can talk a little bit more about the polymers business you mentioned that it was little bit soft for injection molding were those comments specifically to automotive or is it because thats kind of across the board sort of a product or what are you thinking about for the full year in capital spending in that plastics area michael f hilton  nordson corp yeah so i would say were encouraged by the activity that we see in terms of the opportunities id say were finally starting to see some of the extrusion in the film part of the business pickup and that shows up most in our dies business which is looking better id say the injection molding part of the business has been on a strong run up to about six months to nine months ago where its slowed down a little bit and id say that part is continuing so id say we expect to see it to be a positive year from a growth perspective but a lot of these are bigger projects were working on them now they need to come through to have an impact in the year but id say were encouraged by what were seeing from an opportunity standpoint but its not everything working in concert much like the core adhesives business where weve got a couple parts of the business looking pretty attractive and other parts up against tougher comps and not quite as attractive right now but again anything thats really more consumer nondurable related is looking pretty strong and the durable piece is id say at a good level but not strong as we might have seen in parts of last year walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc okay great all right thank you operator and im not showing any further questions at this time id now like to turn the call back to senior director jim jaye for any further remarks james r jaye  nordson corp thank you leanne and on behalf of our team i appreciate you joining our call today im available throughout the week to take any additional questions you

questionandanswer session ill now turn the call over to mike hilton for an overview of our fiscal year  first quarter results and a bit about our second quarter outlook mike please go ahead michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director thank you jim and good morning everyone thank you for attending nordsons  first quarter conference call nordsons team continue to perform at a high level and delivered record first quarter sales and earnings per share im particularly pleased with the  organic sales volume growth we delivered in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago this growth was broadbased across the majority of our product lines and geographies and quite impressive given the challenges presented by a weak macroeconomic environment operating margin in the quarter improved  percentage points compared to the prior year and diluted earnings per share grew  compared to the first quarter a year ago the rate significantly outpacing the strong top line growth while these results were strong they were also impacted by the effect of negative currency translation compared to the first quarter a year ago looking ahead our current backlog and order rates are very strong up  for the latest  weeks as compared to prior year we expect to see solid sequential revenue improvement in the second quarter though yearoveryear results will be impacted by currency headwinds given the current exchange rates ill speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments but first ill turn the call over to greg thaxton our chief financial officer wholl provide more detailed commentary on our current results and our second quarter guidance greg gregory a thaxton  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you and good morning to everyone sales in the quarter were  million an increase of  over the prior years first quarter this sales improvement included and im rounding here an  increase in organic volume a  increase related to the first year effective acquisitions and a  decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation this strength of the organic growth in the quarter highlights the benefits of our business model and the value that we bring to our customers looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment adhesive dispensing segment sales volume decreased less than  as compared to the prioryear first quarter organic growth was solid in product lines serving disposable hygiene general product assembly rigid packaging and plastic injection end markets we continue to see softness in plastic extrusion and polymer compounding and palletizing end markets sales volume in the advanced technology segment increased  over the prior year first quarter organic volume growth was very strong at  and the first year effect of the avalon and dima acquisitions added  growth organic growth was robust in automated dispensing product lines serving mobile device end markets and advanced semiconductor packaging applications as well as our fluid management product lines serving electronics general industrial assembly and medical end markets sales volume in the industrial coating segment increased  compared to the first quarter a year ago the growth was driven by demand for our cold materials and powder coating product lines gross margin for the total company in the first quarter was  one percentage point higher than the level delivered in the prior year primarily due to segment and product mix operating profit in the quarter was  million an increase of  over the prior year and operating margin was  an improvement of  percentage points over the prior years first quarter currency negatively impacted gross margin and operating margin in the quarter by approximately  looking at operating performance on a segment basis adhesive dispensing delivered operating margin of  in the current quarter excluding the effects of currency operating margin would have been equal to the prior years performance on slightly lower sales volume within the advanced technology segment operating margin was  in the first quarter or  excluding shortterm purchase accounting charges related to the stepup in value of acquired inventory this is an improvement of  percentage points as compared to the same period a year ago – excuse me and reflects strong operating leverage on the increased volume operating margin performance for the segment was also negatively impacted by about  due to currency in the industrial coating segment operating margin was  in the first quarter or  excluding the negative impact of currency this performance reflects the seasonally lower first quarter sales volume typical of this segment and a greater mix of engineered systems revenue compared to the same period a year ago given the typical seasonality pattern of this segment we would expect to generate significant operating leverage on higher volume as the year progresses corporate expense in the quarter was up  million compared to the prior year this increase is related to onetime settlement cost of a pension obligation for a business we sold in  our effective tax rate for the quarter was  reflecting the retroactive benefit of the  rd tax credit continuing down the income statement net income for the quarter was  million gaap diluted earnings per share were  an increase of  over the last years first quarter as in previous quarters weve included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between gaap earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain onetime items the current quarters ebitda was  million up  as compared to the same period a year ago cash flow from operations in the first quarter was  million and free cash flow before dividends was  million free cash flow compared to the prior year was impacted by an increase in working capital mostly related to the timing of receivable collections and construction costs for our previously announced fluid management facility in colorado we expect free cash flow in the second quarter to benefit from the collection of these receivables as we trend back towards typical days sales outstanding we have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends we continued our balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter distributing approximately  million in dividends and investing  million for the repurchase of shares shares repurchased in the quarter more than offset the estimated dilutive effect of shares to be distributed for employee benefit programs during the year from a balance sheet perspective we remain very liquid with net debt to ebitda at  times trailing month ebitda as of the end of the first quarter ill now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal  as we typically do weve provided our most recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release these orders are for the latest  weeks as compared to the same  weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with the avalon and dima acquisitions included in both years for the  weeks ending february   order rates are up  as compared to the same  weeks in the prior year within the adhesive dispensing segment order rates were up  over the last  weeks as compared to the same period in the prior year where we generated order growth in all four adhesive product lines in the advanced technology segment order rates over the latest  weeks are up  compared to the same period in the prior year where we generated very strong growth rates in both our electronics system product lines and fluid management product lines mobile device advanced packaging general industrial and medical end markets are the primary drivers of growth for this segment within the industrial coating segment the latest week order rates are up  as compared to the prior year order rates were strong across nearly all product lines on a total company basis orders were strong in all regions except europe which was down slightly from the prior year due to the timing of larger nonwoven system orders and softness in certain end markets served by our polymer product lines backlog at january   was approximately  million an increase of  compared to january  of  and inclusive of  organic growth and  growth due to the avalon and dima acquisitions current backlog increased  compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  these backlog amounts are calculated at january   exchange rates let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal  were forecasting sales to be in the range of down  to down  as compared to the second quarter a year ago this range is inclusive of organic growth of down  to up   growth from the first year effective acquisitions and a negative  impact related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation based on current exchange rates at the midpoint of our sales forecast we expect second quarter gross margin to be  and operating margin is forecasted to be  were estimating second quarter interest expense of about  million and an effective tax rate of approximately  resulting in second quarter forecasted gaap diluted earnings in the range of  per share to  per share were forecasting the fullyear effective tax rate excluding discrete items to be about  based on current tax law we also expect normal maintenance capital spending for the fullyear to be between  million to  million in addition we estimate approximately  million remaining in capital expenditures associated with the our previously announced investment for a new facility in colorado supporting our fluid management product lines the bulk of which will be spent in the second quarter to add a few additional comments related to currency assuming exchange rates for the rest of fiscal  remain where they are today we expect currency translation to negatively impact fullyear sales by about  we also estimate currency will negatively impact fullyear gross margin and operating margin by approximately  in terms of the currency impact on earnings per share our historical results have shown that for every  change to sales related to currency translation eps is impacted approximately  times that amount in the same direction this currency impact is due to the translation effect of converting foreign currency sales and costs back to us dollars which is not hedged we have for a longtime hedged our cash exposure by using forward contracts getting back to first quarter results in summary our global team delivered a very strong first quarter we have strong order momentum leading into our second quarter although the impact of negative currency translation and the expected timing of shipments for this strong order activity will impact sales in the second quarter mike will share more comments relative to the current pace of the business and our view of sales for fiscal  with that ill turn the call over back to you mike michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director thank you greg before taking your questions as greg noted id like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook first i want to thank our global team again for their hard work their commitment to our customers propel nordson to a very solid start to our year at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance were expecting sequential sales growth of about  which we should leverage to delivering operating margin approximately  percentage points higher than the first quarter and earnings per share that are  higher than the first quarter as greg mentioned on a yearoveryear basis we do expect currency translation to remain a significant headwind to revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter and fullyear given current exchange rates excluding this currency translation effect our underlying business remains sound our backlog is solid and week order rates are up a strong  compared to the same period a year ago this growth in organic orders are impressive given the challenging macroeconomic environment given the strength you might expect our organic growth in the second quarter to exceed the  level we are forecasting at the midpoint of our guidance as we typically have a strong correlation between order growth rates and the outlook for the next quarter to help reconcile this let me provide some additional color first timing does play a role here as the current backlog does include some longer lead time items that are expected to benefit the third quarter this is particularly true within advanced technology and industrial coatings segments in addition were optimistic as to our likely success on various projects that are not yet in our backlog that should generate revenue beyond the second quarter our participation in these large dollar projects reflects the consultative approach in applications expertise we bring to our customers and in several cases is being driven by innovative nordson technology due to the competitive reasons and customer confidentiality agreements regarded with the details we can share at this time directionally however we can provide some general commentary while were not providing a specific forecast beyond our second quarter we are optimistic that the current backlog current order growth rates and project momentum will drive doubledigit organic growth in the second half of our year as compared to the prior year resulting in high singledigit organic growth for the fullyear from a broader perspective there are many reasons we continue to feel good about our longerterm prospects while we cant control currency or other aspects of the macroeconomic environment there are many things we can control and that is where we were focused the worst of these is innovative technology nordson earned  patents in  driven by our envision process we continue to introduce products that provide tangible benefits to our customers and are helping to drive organic growth second is continuous improvement the nordson business system is our set of tools and best practices for driving improvement in all value streams across the company we continue to ingrain the business system in all we do third is adding to the portfolio through targeted and strategic acquisitions we continue to evaluate opportunities in the spaces weve talked about previously and are working to optimize our integration processes deliver value faster finally were focused on making a strong team even better our talent management and development initiatives continue to gain momentum ensuing were equipped to capture the growth opportunities that we see overall were focused on providing our customers with the best experience in the industries we serve and delivering excellent shareholder returns over the longterm and we will continue our balanced approach for capital allocation including returning value directly to shareholders with dividends and remaining prudent with regards to our share repurchase activity and executing on appropriate acquisition opportunities at this time let me turn to your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and the first question is from joe radigan of keybanc your line is now open joe k radigan  keybanc capital markets inc good morning guys michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director good morning joe joe k radigan  keybanc capital markets inc mike maybe we can start with your comments around the timing in the second quarter can you provide any more granularity in terms of growth by segment i mean obviously youve got some longer lead time stuffs in ics but orders are fairly good in adhesives and that tends to be to be relatively short cycle it sounds like theres some longer lead time stuff in advanced tech but theres a – you have a relatively easy comp on a yearoveryear basis and orders were up almost  there and that business has been growing at a doubledigit clip here for i think three consecutive quarters so can you maybe reconcile the growth by what youre expecting by segment michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah joe you did hit the – sort of the key areas that tend to have bigger projects and bigger projects tend to be a little bit longer lead item we also have projects in here where our customers have asked for sort of phased deliveries so thats also a part of what were seeing and that falls into the two areas in particular that you mentioned the industrial coatings and the advanced technology area there are elements of our plastics business that have some longer lead time orders like our pelletizing business that also impact that so from our perspective what weve seen is more of systems orders which is encouraging and some of those are phased from a delivery standpoint and thats really the main fact – chalk it up essentially timing joe k radigan  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then in terms of the cadence of orders that you saw through the week period first quarter is typically a soft spot in the customer capital cycle did you see orders – order rate strengthen in recent weeks can you kind of talk about how that develop michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah yeah joe as you know its soft because of the holiday period and it tends to – as we talked about in the past orders tend to get to a lowpoint sort of over the holidays right after the new year and then start to pickup and we absolutely did see that trend where each of the last few weeks has gotten stronger generally across most businesses joe k radigan  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then maybe lastly in terms of the operating margin at the midpoint of your guidance i think you said thats expected to be about  thats almost a  basis point or about a  basis point decline yearoveryear some of that probably  basis points of that i think is the fx but is there a mix factor as well in the second quarter in terms of the timing of engineered versus standard stuff michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah so youve – currently have the currency is a significant impact and then when you look at things volume is relatively soft and actually down a little bit so we get a little bit of a negative leverage there relative to our spend base so its not anything that were alarmed about again i think its largely the timing issue on the organic piece and were really pretty encouraged by the prospects that we see in addition to orders already in hand the currency piece as greg said were going to deal with over the next couple of quarters and it is a strong headwind and it does impact margin to the tune of about  basis points maybe a little more in the second quarter and a little less as we go throughout the year joe k radigan  keybanc capital markets inc okay thanks mike operator thank you the next question is from charlie brady of bmo capital markets your line is open charles d brady  bmo capital markets united states hi thanks good morning guys michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director hey charlie gregory a thaxton  chief financial officer  senior vice president hi charlie charles d brady  bmo capital markets united states hey could you give us a sense of what the parts business look like in the quarter was there any – i guess im trying to parse out if that had any meaningful impact on the margins particularly at adhesive dispensing michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yearoveryear it was pretty much the same as last year around i think  or  charlie so no significant impact adhesives is one of the areas where we feel the biggest impact from a currency perspective charles d brady  bmo capital markets united states right right i just want to go back to jeffs question on the segment organic growth particularly on adhesive dispensing because if im hearing you correctly that one – and i guess some in the plastics but the majority of this long lead time or phasein of orders is happening in ics and advanced tech not so much in adhesive dispensing so can you give us a sense of what youre looking for kind of on organic growth just on the adhesive dispensing in q michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director well i think overall for the year were thinking – the things will be consistent with our longterm kind of growth rates i think in the second quarter were looking for things to be a little bit less and then – and pick up based on some of the orders trends coming in so not too atypical when you look at sort of the more traditional adhesives the one area that is strong right now but can be lumpy is the product assembly piece because those tend to be bigger systems orders as well but nothing atypical that we see here in terms of progress on that part of the business were engaged by what we see across most of the product lines gregory a thaxton  chief financial officer  senior vice president and charlie its greg id just add quartertoquarter we might see some trends – softening trend in one quarter versus the next but as mike mentioned if we look at that business on a longerterm basis kind of across the year wed expect to see kind of that – that typical mid singledigit kind of growth rate in adhesives charles d brady  bmo capital markets united states yeah i guess im just trying to square it up because you had  order growth in the quarter which was – thats a good solid order number for adhesives and im not hearing that you have a lot of longer lead time phasein on the adhesive side so im – unless im hearing it incorrectly so i guess im just trying to square up  really good order growth but maybe not translating into the same kind of growth organically in q am i correct or i mean is there stuff that is being phased in like the other two segments or am i missing a piece here michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director its mainly on the plastic side that the – particularly the pelletizer business that tends to be a little bit longer lead times so youre seeing that sort of impacted in the nearterm there is nothing unusual in the adhesive side as greg said you can have some one quarter and other movement based on some orders and typically those orders will be in the product assembly area thats been pretty strong for us here of late so nothing unusual there but we do have our orders in the plastic side that are little bit longer lead time and thats pulling that number down in the shortterm charles d brady  bmo capital markets united states okay thanks operator thank you and the next question is from allison poliniak of wells fargo your line is open allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc hi guys good morning michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director hey good morning gregory a thaxton  chief financial officer  senior vice president hi allison allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc just want to go back to operating margins particularly as we look to the back half you talked about currency headwinds and it sounds like theres some system headwind there im just trying to marry that with the expected volume improvement i mean is it going to be i mean should we sort of expect that acceleration on the ebit side as well michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah absolutely i mean i think you know that weve got tremendous incremental margin leverage on volume so in a typical year well see margin improve from the first quarter throughout the year as volumes improve just on a seasonal basis and this year based on some of these orders stretching into the third quarter and what we see from a project list and some new technology introductions we expect to see that volume lift later in the year and with that youll see the margin lift that we typically see across the quarters with volume allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc okay and then just even on the second half you noted some confidence in the second half acceleration in top line growth is there any segment or end market specifically that youre probably a little bit more concerned about as we look to the back half of the year michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director id say the growth across most of our segments looks solid there could be certain end markets that are a little soft here but were making them up in others id say more concern would be around geography and just because some of the geographies are struggling from a economic perspective so when you think about the americas particularly latin america europe is not as robust and japan is more of a mixed bag that said some of the other geographies have been considerably stronger so id say its more of a mixed bag on geography than end market applications there are obviously some that are pretty strong and things like auto medical electronics applications including wireless those kind of things are generally pretty strong weve got new areas where were interested in that are picking up but for us also were introducing a lot of new products this year i would categorize in the singles category a nice new incremental growth opportunities or recapitalization opportunities that i think will also help in our – getting some traction allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc great thank you so much operator thank you and the next question is from the christopher glynn of oppenheimer your line is open christopher d glynn  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks good morning michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director good morning gregory a thaxton  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning chris christopher d glynn  oppenheimer  co inc broker i was – wanted to go into the second half margin outlook a little bit more i think in the past maybe youve offered directional guidance on quantifying a range or expectation for sequential incremental margins so given the volume outlook its a little different modeling this year given the fx dynamics so wondering if you could kind of offer some kind of vague or specific rule of thumb michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah i mean the incremental margins are significant as the volume grows throughout the year it does depend a little bit on mix so for example the industrial coatings given the nature of scope what we provide there while they have very good incremental margins that are probably in the  kind of range are different than what we might see in technology which would be higher and traditional adhesives would be higher yet so it does depend a little bit on the mix but we would expect to see strong incremental margins across each of the businesses as it grows throughout the year you can see from the order rates that were providing industrial coatings is stepping up nicely and the advanced technology is stepping up nicely so those mix effects will be a little bit lower than say if all the adhesives business was stepping up but we would expect a pretty typical pattern as the volume grows up – grows for the rest of the year only to be moderated a little bit by mix christopher d glynn  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks thats helpful and then at ads just wondering how youd score the investments in the plastics processing at this point i think edi and xaloy are coming up under – on about three years with nordson and just wondering if there is any change to your view of the longterm returns and update on how you get there the integrations et cetera michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah maybe ill just start with a comment on the – for the two major end markets that support all that business as greg mentioned in his comments the plastic injection part of the end markets are doing well and when you think about the products that are being made there it goes into auto it goes into electronics it goes into medical those areas are all doing pretty well when you look at the film side of the business the film side of the business particularly the highend film side of the business is really struggling while theres some increase in demand europe slowing china slowing latin america slowing really hurt the sort of supplydemand situation on the film business so id say were still struggling pretty significantly on the film business that affects the dyes business the most a different application like fluid coatings in the dyes business is doing really well but the bigger application is struggling so were obviously – were behind where we had hoped to be and the supplydemand imbalance has not resolved itself yet and we could be looking at another year or two before thats completely resolved and thats a function really of the soft growth primarily outside the us on the demand side at this point now as far as integration goes we made i think great progress on the integration of those businesses were focused on new products in sort of other markets that we havent played in as much particularly on the film side and were getting some traction there and weve built up our international capability its allowing us to do well particularly in asia so were encouraged by that but in the shortterm were obviously behind where we thought we would be christopher d glynn  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay thank you operator thank you and the next question is from jason ursaner of cjs securities your line is open jason m ursaner  cjs securities inc good morning michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director hey jason gregory a thaxton  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning jason m ursaner  cjs securities inc i had a little trouble connecting and missed some of the notes around each segment organic growth and the order rates obviously extremely strong just wondering maybe if you could walk through which divisions in the tech segment were driving that in the week orders michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah its pretty much across the – across the board so if you look at – and the electronics part of the business is doing well in wireless but also in more traditional advanced packaging applications have started to pick up and if you look at some of the gartner data its encouraging in that area but also auto electronics has been strong and then outside of the electronics space a lot of general industry applications that would affect our efd business are strong we have a bunch of new products coming into play across our efd business as well as our systems business and then the medical businesses arent really well – really driven by the broadening of our product line and some international growth now as well so really across the board that looks very encouraging at the moment jason m ursaner  cjs securities inc okay and the traditional pc market i know that yeah its been a struggle but came back to growth – at least in global numbers and especially in the domestic market have you seen any of that translate in some of the more i guess legacy applications in pc and server michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yes we are seeing that my comment on advanced packaging is directly related to pc desktop server kind of applications both with end users and then sort of the outsourced manufacturers we saw some encouraging orders coming through so were certainly starting to see that jason m ursaner  cjs securities inc okay and the investments youve been making in tech just any update on kind of where those stand and any success on the curing side issue  michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah so we have on the wafer project we launched we picked up our second big order in that business and we have probably more than  significant prospects that we expect to see signed this year so were getting good – i think good traction on that were also taking advantage of expanding our local china manufacturing applications and we have a number of new products across the – that particular systems base that were introducing this year that we are seeing some good traction and so its encouraging at this point jason m ursaner  cjs securities inc okay i appreciate the commentary thanks operator thank you and the next question is from jason rodgers of great lakes review your line is open jason a rodgers  great lakes review yes i was wondering if you can give an update on the freedom and liberty systems and how that – how they play into your forecast for strong second half of the year michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah weve had an uptick on both of those products in the last couple of quarters i think what we used to characterize last year is probably revenue exceeded expectations volume didnt quite exceed expectations i think that is continuing but we have seen an uptick the one we issue we mentioned was the availability of new adhesives that would further enhance the benefit of those particular new products has really not come to market yet and some of the things going on in the oil industry right now and the supply chain probably delayed that a little bit further but theyre clearly freedom is top of the line liberty is sort of our next tiered position and we have a number of other tiered positions so we feel pretty good about what we have to offer broadly and then weve only recently started to offer those products in asia so id say were at expectations on those products not accelerating the way we might have hoped based on the availability of the adhesives jason a rodgers  great lakes review and greg the pension settlement expense that you have in your press release is that included in the selling and admin line of the income statement gregory a thaxton  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah that is – in the segment detail thats in corporate spending jason a rodgers  great lakes review thank you operator thank you the next question is from walter liptak of global hunter your line is open walter scott liptak  global hunter securities llc hi thanks good morning michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director good morning walt gregory a thaxton  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning walter scott liptak  global hunter securities llc i wanted to ask about the coatings business very strong orders there and this is the third quarter that weve seen of the strong order trend and as i think back through the past weve seen periods like this before where you kind of take on a couple of quarters of increasing orders and then my recollection is that then it starts to slow down again so i guess id like to get some color on whats driving it what the visibility looks like as we go further into  michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director yeah so of course walt yeah so i would say obviously the business itself is linked to the business cycle and thats i think what youre referring to in your comments that said there are a number of markets that have been strong so auto for example is one thats been strong for us with some of our cold materials acquisition in the sealant equipment business weve been able to take that – now starting to take that internationally were seeing some uptick there and weve talked about in the past – oil and gas exploration and what thats doing from pipe coating application pipe coating so i would say solid but even in businesses that are more traditional like our container business were seeing good order growth some of that is upgrades and recapitalization which new technology helps so id say generally its fairly broadbased id say the areas that are still a little bit – a little bit slow would be the things like coatings for recreational products for some office furniture things like appliances kind of go up and down a little bit but theyre generally solid so id say the key drivers are the ones that ive talked about here and weve got as you look at the orders some pretty good visibility and – at least in the nearterm and when we look at our projects list really across the globe we see some pretty good activity walter scott liptak  global hunter securities llc okay great it sounds good and then just a general one on currency is there any fundamental impact on currency like are you any less competitive in any markets because of the stronger dollar michael f hilton  president chief executive officer  director no if you look at – were pretty well distributed from a supply chain standpoint so its really the translation impacts that youre looking at there so no were not seeing any significant competitive threats there but the degree of change particularly in europe in the end and to a lesser extent the pound has impacted the translation effect but were not seeing a competitive dynamic given the balance in our supply chain walter scott liptak  global hunter securities llc okay got it thank you operator thank you and im not showing any further questions in queue at this time would you like to close with any closing remarks james r jaye  directorinvestor relations  communications yes this is jim again thank you everybody for joining the call i do have some calls scheduled with some of you later today im
