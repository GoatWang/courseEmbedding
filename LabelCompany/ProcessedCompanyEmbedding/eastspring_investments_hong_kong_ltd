overboard share overviewfor second half of  early ’s turbulent seas have slowly given way to calmer waters albeit with shock waves rippling into the june quarter global not local issues seem in the driver’s seat for much of the coming six months adding to these factors are the uncertainties resulting from the us november elections the uk’s june brexit vote the bank of japan’s stance on negative interest rates so ’s turbulent seas are not stilled yet ebbing and flowing global fears will expose opportunities at the local level our “buy value when it appears tuck away and do not chase the
