company has been dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its continuing activities  the company has not identified any business combination and therefore cannot ascertain with any degree of certainty the capital requirements for any particular transaction  in addition the company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources  the accompanying financial statements have been presented on the basis of the continuation of the company as a going concern and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods  actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly

loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the period  the company currently has no dilutive securities and as such basic and diluted loss per share are the same for all periods presented interim financial statements the unaudited interim financial information included in this report reflects normal recurring adjustments that management believes are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations financial position and cash flows for the periods presented  this interim information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes contained in the company′s form k filed march   the results of operations for the three and six months ended june   are not necessarily

analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statement notice certain statements made in this quarterly report on form q are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  in regard to the plans and objectives of management for future operations such statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results performance or achievements of zeta acquisition corp i “we” “us” “our” or the “company” to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties the companys plans and objectives are based in part on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to among other things future economic competitive and market conditions and future business decisions all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the company although the company believes its assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance the forwardlooking statements included in this quarterly report will prove to be accurate in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved description of business the company was incorporated in the state of delaware on november   inception and maintains its principal executive office at  walnut street suite  des moines iowa  since inception the company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing the company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of or merger with an operating business the company filed a registration statement on form sb with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” on february   and since its effectiveness the company has focused its efforts to identify a possible business combination the company based on proposed business activities is a “blank check” company the sec defines those companies as any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act  as amended the “exchange act” and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions the company is also a “shell company” defined in rule b under the exchange act as a company with no or nominal assets other than cash and no or nominal operations management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination the company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as we are subject to those requirements in addition the company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  “jobs act” and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanesoxley act and exemptions from the requirements of sections aa and b of the securities exchange act of  to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved   the company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act this election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates          we will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of  the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed  billion  the date on which we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period  the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the securities act of  as amended or  when the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of  the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter to the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as such term is defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company including  not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanes oxley act  scaled executive compensation disclosures and  the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements instead of three years the company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation the company’s principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with an operating business the company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business   the company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow  during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to i       filing exchange act reports and ii      investigating analyzing and consummating an acquisition   we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors as of the date of the period covered by this report the company has  in cash there are no assurances that the company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed   currently however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available the company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering        since our registration statement on form sb went effective our management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives of other entities regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another   the company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had current assets equal to  comprised exclusively of cash and cash equivalents  this compares with current assets of   comprised of cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses as of december     the company’s current liabilities as of june   totaled

continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms the company may not be able to implement its plan of operations        results of operations the company has not conducted any active operations since inception except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates no revenue has been generated by the company from november   inception though june   it is unlikely the company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company of which there can be no assurance  it is managements assertion that these
