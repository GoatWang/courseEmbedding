can help you ride out the bumps and keep your eyes on the big picture stay calm and get professional advice avoid making quick moves on your own as tempting as it may be instead meet with your financial professional and share your concerns resist making decisions on the basis of single events reexamine your investment goals time horizon and risk tolerance with your financial professional to make sure they remain appropriate maintain a diversified investment portfolio work with your financial professional to spread your risks consider selecting a mix of mutual funds that invests in stocks and bonds additionally keeping an appropriate amount of your portfolio in money market or cash equivalent mutual funds and other liquid investments can help you meet shortterm needs include funds that invest outside the united states nonus markets often move in their own market cycles diversification doesn’t guarantee a profit but over time it can help to reduce the effects of volatility maintain a diversified investment portfolio invest regularly — in good and bad times avoid moving everything into stocks at the hint of good news — or everything into cash following bad news instead of fearing a down market view it as an opportunity to buy shares at potentially lower prices consider investing a fixed amount every month or quarter a strategy known as dollar cost averaging you won’t have to guess which way the market is going you also wont risk the possibility of investing all of your money at the top of the market please note that this strategy of regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss invest regularly — in good and bad times invest regularly — in good and bad times invest for income consider mutual funds that stress the role of dividends — or bond funds that produce a steady stream of interest payments incomeproducing investments can provide a cushion during a down stock market after all a dividend is yours whether the stock price is rising or falling invest for income avoid jumping in and out of the market successful market timing during a bear market is extremely difficult because it requires two nearperfect actions getting out at the right time and getting back in at the right time as a result investors typically end up buying high and selling low one reason it’s difficult a bear market is not usually characterized by a straightline decline in stock prices instead it tends to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases and then declines that bring with them corresponding feelings of euphoria and concern other

prices consider investing a fixed amount every month or quarter a strategy known as dollar cost averaging you won’t have to guess which way the market is going you also wont risk the possibility of investing all of your money at the top of the market please note that this strategy of regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss invest regularly — in good and bad times

recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have
