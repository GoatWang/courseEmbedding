integrated and capital planning you know it’s going to be bad but how bad  let’s get some perspective here  one of the things we love about the inventory solution in ibp is the ability to predict service levels  yeah it’s a glass half full kind of thing but wouldn’t you rather know ahead of time rather than scramble at the last minute  we would but then again we’re planners  let’s talk a language that everyone understands cash  with ibp inventory optimization you don’t have to focus on abstract measurements  like volume and mass but can instead focus on dimensions that matter like

you put it that counts  this means the ability to scientifically maintain service levels with the most efficient inventory plan imaginable  maybe it’s closer to the customer maybe it’s in components  only ibp inventory knows the sweet spot to maximize your service every single time what happens when finance and supply chain work together on a single goal like a harmonized supply plan  we don’t know because it’s never happened  but what if you just stop talking past each other and at least appreciate the other’s viewpoint  cordial meetings  when supply chains can work within capital

panic room becomes a planning room  since you’re not reinventing the wheel each time whenever things get tight just play by the rules  response in ibp allows consistent and fair execution of those rules  so crunchtime becomes gotime  i know they’re all your favorites but you’ve got to choose  when safety stock turns into not enough stock you need to prioritize  rather than make it up on the fly make a decision  prioritize by demand type customer type or whatever other type you need to make a decision on  the ibp response module will peg demand to supply show the issues and help triage  in short ibp response makes order out of chaos when reacting to customer expectations requires catlike reflexes then it helps to have a plan in advance  don’t get caught flatfooted  jump into action with
