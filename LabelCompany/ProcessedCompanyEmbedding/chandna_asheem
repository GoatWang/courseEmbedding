partner with consumer and enterprise software entrepreneurs follow us here httptcochhtrjun obsidian cofounders matt wolff glenn chisholm and ben johnsonour investment in obsidian securityby asheem chandna and sarah guosecurity is a large growing concern in our digital connected world as data and applications move into hybrid cloud environments the surface area that enterprises need to protect continues to increase in both complexity and size employees contractors and partners require dynamic access that keeps up with the pace of their business and enterprises need security offerings that are more automated and require less work from defenders to fit this new reality greylock has been fortunate to work closely with a distinguished list of innovative security companies over the years including palo alto networks okta imperva and opendns and more recently with skyhigh networks awake networks and cato networks today we are announcing that greylock has led the series a in obsidian security and both of us asheem chandna and sarah guo have joined the board we are excited about obsidian for a few reasons the team the space and their approachworldclass founding teamthe obsidian founders are accomplished product innovators and seasoned security practitioners glenn chisholm ceo and cofounder was previously the cto of cylance where he led the company’s product management and engineering teams prior to cylance glenn served as the first ciso of telstra ben johnson cto and cofounder previously cofounded carbon black where he also served as cto prior to carbon black ben was a practitioner at the nsa and cia matt wolff chief scientist and cofounder was previously the chief data scientist at cylance and earlier also served at the nsa products that glenn ben and matt previously helped design develop and deliver are now deployed across thousands of enterprise customers we’ve known glenn for several years as an important industry innovator and more recently got to know ben and matt a few whiteboard sessions some dinners and bunch of enterprise customer conversations deepened our already strong interest in working with the obsidian team we are grateful for the opportunity to go on this journey with them as founding investors in their new companylarge and growing problem spaceglobal spend on it security products and services is estimated to be b today and is expected to double over the next five years obsidian will help customers address a soft belly of enterprise security — user account security as rob joyce former chief hacker of the nsa tailored access operations tao and new white house cybersecurity coordinator said in a rare presentation last year “persistence and focus will get you in without a zero day there are so many more vectors…such as stolen credentials…that are easier less risky more productive”innovative approachafter years of working on endpoint technologies and deep in the trenches with customers glenn ben and matt each independently saw that user security was underserved credentials are often the keys to the kingdom — the easiest vector for attackers and abuse is hard to detect and remediate today — there are no good existing solutions obsidian has three core product theses in securing users a modern machine learning approach an architecture that fits today’s hybrid reality and design for operational security efficiency ben moved his family from chicago to join glenn and matt in southern california and obsidian has set up offices in gorgeous newport beach just check out matt’s shorts and flip flops in the picture they have begun recruiting and product development and are in conversations with prospective customer design partners if you have interest in joining an early worldclass product team looking to help solve an important area in enterprise security please email applyobsidiansecuritycom we are thrilled to back the obsidian team and look forward to helping them on their mission to provide user

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
