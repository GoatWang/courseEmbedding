published friday june   great company overall great company overall offer a vast amount of parts and nearly everything you could possibly need to maintain your vehicle with oe parts like most i agree that their customer service needs more people that understand cars it completely depends on who you get i got a wrong part in one of my orders and the next day it was already sent out for delivery before i got the email that it would be taken care of however if you have technical issues with an order it is best to talk with a tech rep rather than a sales rep the tech reps can and have done customer service related tasks for me and theyre generally better and more understanding about the issues than the sales reps for example i got a strut tower bar a few weeks back and it was rubbing in my rain traypinch seam on backside of my engine bay i regretfully attempted to talk with a customer service rep about the issues i was having and they clearly had no idea what i was talking about i asked if i could be transferred to a tech rep and was told i would need to start that interaction myselfoverall i use ecs for nearly all my product needs and will likely continue to do so their engineeringrd departments go above and beyond some of the other aftermarket suppliers useful share facebook google twitter reply from ecs tuning llc published monday june   caseythanks for sharing

pagesreviewstackedhidestackzero marcas j hudgins  review published thursday june   updated tuesday june   on their way to being a great company good company but the customer service could definitely use work i ordered some parts from the and paid for extra shipping charges so that i could get them faster turns out the part was on back order even though the website said nothing about this back order so i ended up waiting just under a month for parts that were supposed to be at my house in about a weeki cracked and emailed customer service assuming they would understand my frustration and offer a refund for my extra shipping charges nope i was told by jacob that he could send a different part and we could work out the difference i declined and directed the conversation towards the extra money i paid for no reason he didnt respond so long story short i paid for faster shipping it took way longer than normal speed shipping because ecs failed to mention the back order and jacob or ecs never offered me a refund for my extra pay i will admit they are a good company but customer service is very important and i dont think their whole customer service department understands that the money wasnt a big deal but the thought counts offer the refunds and if you cant then offer something else or at least acknowledge the problem with the customer dont just ignore them i would have taken a free sticker and a were sorry note a pen a  discount on a future item a letter from the customer service manager guys its literally just the thought i originally left a  for this review however i was immediately contacted the next day and spoke with the head of their sales department he went on to apologize for the issue thank me for my honest review gave me a discount and really took control of the situation though the discount wasnt a necessity i did feel that he understood what had happened and why the review was the way it was he took the time out of his day twice to email me and make my problem a thing of the past i realize that this may all be in response to the  but at the same time a step in the right direction for the wrong reason is still a step in the right direction i hope they continue to do follow ups and to help everybody so that they will become the great company im sure they strive to be thank you ecs useful share facebook google twitter reply from ecs tuning llc
