executive officer lesar succeeded richard b cheney who left when he accepted the republican presidential candidate george w bushs offer to become his vice presidential running mate cheney stated in a pr newswire article having worked closely with dave lesar and the halliburton management team over the past five years i have great confidence for the future success of halliburton july   halliburton

planning and management support for the us military advancing within halliburton after  years of employment at arthur andersen in dallas texas last serving as a commercial group director and partner in charge of the oil and gas manufacturing telecommunications and retail sectors lesar joined halliburton for two years from  to  he was executive vice president of finance and administration of halliburton energy and the next year he served as executive vice president and chief financial officer of halliburton energy services a halliburton business unit from june  through june  he was president and chief executive officer of brown  root the halliburton business unit that provides engineering and construction services in the petroleum forest products civil environmental manufacturing maintenance and government markets from june  to august  lesar was president and chief operating officer of halliburton in august  lesar assumed the position of chairman president and ceo of halliburton impact on company strategy halliburtons strategy essentially did not change when lesar took over from cheney for several years lesar had already been actively running the company with cheney responsible for interacting with customers in fact during the years before becoming chief executive officer lesar was critical in the companys transition from marketshare mining which involved concentrating solely in mining to a more diversified position involving the entire spectrum of oil and gas products and services lesar helped halliburton executives recognize that the industry was preparing to outsource more technologies to service companies—services that lesar wanted halliburton to be able to provide throughout the industry as a result of the outsourcing trend lesar led halliburton in a series of acquisitions which allowed the company to obtain the skills and tools it needed to offer services in such areas as directional logging liquefied gas products drilling and reservoir integration he found that halliburton was able to provide these services to a wide range of companies from large integrated oil companies to small independent companies in addition lesar played an important part in developing halliburtons investment in research and development which reduced costs increased safety and decreased environmental impacts from  to  lesar oversaw halliburtons billiondollar investment in developing technologies these technologies created products that solved problems enhanced assets and delivered longterm value for customers and shareholders by   percent of halliburtons total revenues were in new technology accounts reversing losing projects in the first few years of the s halliburton lost money on several large international engineering procurement installation and construction epic projects the epic projects were formerly run as lumpsum payments—single payments made at the beginning of a contract and in which halliburton paid all unexpected costs during the contract period however since actual costs were often higher than estimates losses occurred lesar saw for instance that in  halliburton lost  million on a joint venture to develop  deepwater oil wells off brazils coast and another  million on an offshore philippine oil platform project as a result kbrs operating profit margins were only  percent in  below its predicted  percent lesar declared that halliburton would no longer bid for lumpsum payments on international epic projects logcap by  the us military relied greatly on private military companies pmcs to support its operations in many countries such as iraq in fact civilian contractors handled as much as  to  percent of critical military support services in iraq lesar made sure that kbr was the bestequipped service company to assume those jobs in the early s the company housed fed and maintained with such functions as mail delivery laundry facilities and operations and heavy equipment use american fighting troops in some of the worlds most remote and dangerous locations based partly on kbrs past performance in supporting us forces lesar secured in december  a year project from the us pentagon known as the logistics civil augmentation program logcap—a us army plan that hires civilian contractors to support us forces in department of defense missions the costplus contract a pricing system that calculates the price of a product by adding a specified percentage as profit to the contract—thus guaranteeing the company a small profit—was openended and thus gave kbr the budgetary freedom to send its employees anywhere in the world to run military operations lesar secured kbrs first logcap contract in june  during the war on terrorism it was awarded a  million contract to operate support services at camp stronghold freedom which is located at the khanabad air base in central uzbekistan kbr supplied products and services to khanabad—one of the primary us bases in the afghanistan war that housed approximately one thousand us soldiers later in november  lesar secured a oneyear contract estimated at  million to make available laundry services showers mess halls and heating equipment services for troops at bases in bagram and khandahar in afghanistan kbr also received contracts to help run incirlik air base and other us military facilities in turkey eventures lesar pursued internettype electronic ventures eventures in order to integrate other leading companies into one group one of lesars initiatives was his  agreement to partially acquire petroleum place a leading internet company that focuses on improving how procedures are conducted with respect to buying and selling within the global oil and gas market in partnership with halliburtons wholly owned subsidiary landmark graphics corporation petroleum place offers online access to landmark software for use with buying and selling of company products and services in addition in  the alliance was planning to develop software for evauating prospective oil and gas fields and other such properties lesar stated that such a project would enable halliburton to better assist oil companies with the management of their oil and gas reservoirs though acquisitions and divestitures are generally inefficient in discovering new properties and evaluating existing properties lesar believed that the petroleum place alliance with its use of internetbased data analysis would reduce the time needed for analysis reviews and lower costs of materials and labor criticism halliburton and its subsidiaries were widely condemned in the early s for their contracts in various countries where environmental problems and human rights violations are widespread including algeria bolivia bosnia brazil haiti iran iraq libya somalia and indonesia the companys associations with past and present us administrations including its relationship with vice president dick cheney who served as halliburtons chief executive officer between  and  were also problematic lesar and halliburton were criticized about accounting procedures as well in the late s halliburton transferred from costplus contracts to more fixedprice contracts the new contracts required the company to finish jobs for a fixed fee and then to attempt to negotiate payments of cost overruns and changes in orders although resolving such disputes can take months or even years halliburton financial officials decided it was reasonable to identify for tax purposes at least part of the revenue from the claims during the time they were in dispute the us securities and exchange commission investigated whether this accounting practice was intended to defraud lesar also contended with asbestos litigation which was initiated when the company acquired dressor industries in  for  billion a dressor subsidiary had once used a carcinogen in its pipe coatings and bricks lesar initiated a bold plan to settle asbestosrelated lawsuits by instituting a contained bankruptcy of kbr a plan that would keep most of halliburton out of bankruptcy future prospects lesar hoped that halliburton would continue to be a leading—if not the leading—player in the multibilliondollar rebuilding of postwar iraq particularly the rebuilding of the countrys oil wells but along with the increase of government contracts awarded to halliburton came accusations that the company was receiving favoritism from politically prominent employees and former employees lesar rejected such talk by pointing to the companys long history as a government contractor he continued to insist that he was very proud of the halliburton organization and especially of its support of the us military and the savings it had provided to the militarys overseas activities in any case the bottom line for halliburton was that its future especially with lesar at the helm looked promising and profitable see also entries on arthur andersen  company société
