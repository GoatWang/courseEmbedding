damaj bassam damaj thank you kerry and thank you all for joining us our call today this afternoon i am delighted to be on the call today to give our shareholders our third quarter update once again our third quarter was a record quarter for innovus pharmaceuticals as we reported  million in revenues for the third quarter this is an approximately a  increase from the previous period last year in addition we reported a total of  million in revenues for the nine month ended in september  which is nearly  increase from the previous period last year the team has done a tremendous job in integrating our products under the beyond human sales and marketing platform which resulted in having now several products generating revenues including the beyond human testosterone the vesele sensum product zestra and recalmax the company’s revenues to date put us on track for revenues of  million for the whole of  and we are confirming our guidance of  million in revenues for  and we currently project profitability next year please note that our projected  million in revenues for  does not include  million to  million in projected revenues from fluticare if approved by the fda by the end of  and launch by the second quarter of  it is just impressive to see how the company had drown from  in revenues for  to  million yeartodate and tracking to  million for  we are efficiently utilizing our beyond human sales and platform and integrating our products under this platform and the results speak for themselves revenues have been growing at  growth rate monthovermonth this is  growth rate monthovermonth since our beyond human acquisition also our growth margins have grown to over  which is a testimony to the laser focused execution of our business plan the fast and continuous growth reported speaks first to the strengths of our beyond human sales and marketing platform and second to our ability to integrate as many of our products under this platform this is a very efficient and powerful platform that reaches between  million to  million potential customers on a monthly basis and here i would like to note again that the  million in projected revenues for  does not include any revenues from the projected launch of fluticare if and when approves by the fda and launch in the second quarter in  nor does it include any additional products the company may acquire or license in the future and before i move into discussing our corporate advances and progress i would like to turn the call over to our chief financial officer robert hoffman to discuss the financial results in details robert robert hoffman thank you bassam as bassam mentioned we recorded revenues in the third quarter and nine months of  totaling  million and  million respectively products continuing to our revenues included bth testosterone booster vesele sensum zestra and recalmax we continue to believe we will achieve  million in revenues for all of  equally impressive and perhaps more our growth margins for the quarter were  up sequentially  from the second quarter of  and significantly higher than our first quarter  gross margins of  we believe this highlights a strength of our beyond human platform and the efficiencies we’ve be able to create by adding our existing products such as zestra recalmax and sensum into the platform we will continue to look for ways to optimize our growth margins in the following quarters into  sales and marketing expense increased to  million in the third quarter and total  million for the nine months ended september   this is primarily driven by the cost of integrating our existing products in the beyond human sales and marketing platform and increase in a number of print and online media advertisements of our existing products truth beyond human platform the increases also attributable to increased cost in sales and marketing support services due to the higher volume of sales orders received as a result of the beyond human asset acquisition in the integration of more products into this platform we expect to see this moderate as a percentage of sales going forward as we see customers utilizing more and more the subscription model to purchase our products general and administrative expenses increased to  million in the third quarter and totaled  million for the nine months ended september   these amounts did however include noncash stockbased compensation totaling  million in the third quarter and  million in the nine months ended september   these amounts also include a noncash amortization expense of  million in the third quarter and  million in nine months ended september   at september   our cash balances grew to  million compared to  at the end of  our cash balances were strengthened by the  million financing we completed in the third quarter we continued to be focused on our goals of expanding our product line by further leveraging our beyond human sales and marketing platform and achieving our goal of profitability in  with  million in revenues in  before taking into any revenues from fluticare exus sales revenues from potential companies we made purchase or the unlicensing of any additional future products with that i turn the call back over to bassam bassam damaj thank you robert i’d like to summarize what we have accomplished during the third quarter i think it is important to understand that the management has been diligently working towards achieving our two main goals first reaching profitability in  with  million in revenues and i believe the growth we have been experiencing and the revenues reports speaks for itself one our monthtomonth growth since our beyond human acquisition is over  now and our margins are  and we are continuously adding more products and expanding our commercial territories outside the us and we are confident with our ability to achieve this goal the second goal is to uplift to a nasdaq but under the right market conditions and this is a very important point for the management as we continuously – continue to diligently evaluate the market conditions along with our share price and the shareholder equity to move forward our listing process as i mentioned in previous calls and interviews we will do the uplift one and only if it is the optimal time for the company and the shareholders and when we see a better appreciation in our share price what have we accomplished in  all i can tell you that we have accomplished quite a bit in  and some of the most important highlights over the last quarters include first which i think is a very important actually accomplishment that we have done we have announced the initiation of the preclinical and clinical program intended to revaluate the safety and efficacy of combination of our supplement result for promoting sexual health with sildenafil sold at viagra in the us by pfizer and is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction with vesele clinically shown to increase erection hardness and maintenance two important components of the erectile dysfunction in men and while it is continuing to be our best revenue performer to date the company is investing in the combination studies with sildenafil nonresponders in order to capture a larger market of segment of the market as you may know phosphodiesterase  or pde inhibitor which include drugs like viagra and cialis levitra are shown to induce an erection in patients but those patients still have issues in the maintenance and hardness of their erection hence why a product like vesele comes in handy additionally close to  of patients rotate between the approved drugs like viagra cialis levitra until they drop out completely from either the lack of response or the increase in the side effects from the higher doses they need to take so the ongoing studies if positive should allow us to address the potential of combining sildenafil and vesele for the patients currently either nonresponsive anymore to those drugs or taking those drugs now pending positive results from the combination we would expect vesele revenues to capture a much larger market or segment of the overall market of the erectile dysfunction as we all know the erectile dysfunction market is about  billion market so we would like to be able to capture as much as we can from such a big market and there is a big need to compliment the current pde or erectile dysfunction drug approved in the market the second item as we entered into an exclusive license agreements with seipel group for the rights to market the urox formulation which has been clinically proven to reduce urinary urgency accidents and both day and night frequency in overactive bladder and in urine incontinence ui and this product will be marketed under the name of uriva rx the overall market of the overactive bladder is a very large market and i think it is important to know that this product has sold over  million in the us last year and due to the doubleblind clinical trial showing very strong and statically significantly results and to our robust beyond human sales and marketing platform we expect to add about  million in revenues from this product to our total revenues third we announced the launch of sensum our product to increase penile sensitivity under the beyond human sales and marketing platform and im happy to report that the sensum sales are growing and in a very short period of time this product has become a good seller for us and now its part of our core product offerings fourth we announced the launch of our brain health supplement recalmax under the beyond human sales and marketing platform in the us recalmax has been shown to increase effort and focus and now we are not targeting a very large market and we are very pleased with the growth the product has shown under our beyond human sales and marketing platform fifth we actually increased our management with the addition of robert hoffman as our executive vice president chief financial officer as you may have seen from roberts bio he is very experienced executive not just in the financial arena but also in the operations manufacturing and pharma space we are very happy with the addition of robert to our team and we look forward to now to working together to continue to improve our margins increase our sales and achieve our two main goals we then closed on  million of financing in july and i think this is very important because this financing was very helpful for us in acquiring more products like rx products for example and increasing our sales and marketing efforts which resulted in our  increase in revenues for the third quarter of this year and lastly we continue our preparation for the launch of fluticare in  if approved by the fda the management is very confident on the prospects of an approval by the fda and we are working diligently on the launch plan and structure not just in the retail space and storage but also under our beyond human sales and marketing platform as currently the market since the rx switch has been moving towards a subscription model versus a one unit purchase from the source and as you know our beyond human platform is very powerful and can reach between  million to  million potential customers on a monthly basis and we believe fluticare if approved by the fda will do very well under our platform with little competition since as you may all know the retail stores that currently will carry such product not actually in a position to offer subscription more of the product to their customers and this is where actually our platform and our infrastructure allow us to commence with lesser competition in the space now returning to our financial results in the third quarter so in this third quarter we reported a very strong performance that reflect growth across several of our products and this is very important we were no longer a one product company that is trading most of their revenues we have now a mix of products that includes vesele beyond the human testosterone booster zestra sensum and recalmax and we look forward to adding to this platform the launch of the zestra multidose and under this platform the urivarx our urivarx product and additional product in order to keep growing our revenues and reach our  million in projected revenues in  and our profitability so over the past couple of years we have really worked hard to shape the quality of the assets in our pipeline this is very important we can have any company that has a good sales platform will not do much without strong assets and i believe we now have a very competitive well known pipeline of commercial and indevelopment assets that are positioned to deliver new breakthroughs to customers and patients over the next few years similarly over the past nine months our business has gained a strong direct to consumer sales and marketing platform a sharper build is focused increase accountability and a greater ability to capture the opportunities within the product unique markets i think it is very important for a company to be able to offer multiple products for targeting the same therapeutic area and this allows companies like us you know to offer the same the same consumers different products targeting different parts of the same segments as the conclusion now as look ahead we will continue to follow this strong clinically validated products we bring in that will enable us to take on sort of the worlds greatest health challenges this is why business development remains an important priority in achieving our goals our appetites for business development and mergers and acquisitions have not changed we continue to seek the best opportunities and collaborations with the right financial evaluation to augment our portfolio and pipeline and in closing our performance in the quarter position us well to continue to invest in our business and to deliver a balanced differentiated portfolio of medicines and consumer products that will allow us to generate longterm growth and sustainable value for our shareholders and for society as a whole and with this i would like to thank you for listening to our call and i’ll pass on for the qa session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from daniel private investor please go ahead daniel hello bassam congratulations on the super quarter bassam damaj thank you daniel my question has to do with the possible approval fluticare and how you feel about that as far as your own corporate timing i know you cant predict when or if it will come but you have any thoughts about when it may happen internally bassam damaj so as fluticare is a very important asset for the company and we are still on the same guidance that we are very hopeful for an approval before the end of the year for the product again as we said we can never actually give a shorter answer improvement approved but the management is very confident about the prospect of a approval of the product and hopefully before the end of the year and if that happens actually that will allow us to launch the product in the second quarter of  and again as just i think it’s important to understand that actually the company is really i think we are waiting for an approval probably more than patients than the shareholder as really this is a very big product for us as we believe this is going to add to us  million to  million and revenues on top of our projected revenues in  so we are really looking forward for a positive approval from the fda for this product daniel and a follow on question about fluticare has to do with your potential market and knowing that it’s on retail shelves right now for example and you’re just addressing the subscription model can you talk a little bit more about any added value that your subscription model will bring and also what your internal views are as far as how long someone may stay on the subscription and if perhaps it could be seasonal bassam damaj so first of all i think the first understand that fluticare access is actually  fluticasone propionate nasal which is actually indicated for nonallergic rhinitis so it’s not a seasonal product people who have nonallergic rhinitis they have to take the product all the time and this is actually where the subscription actuary model comes in so as you know since the switch from rx to otc although you see the products and shelves gsk reported  million revenues for the first quarter then continuously accelerate further an increase in revenues they are reported  million from the launch so this is a very big market which actually becoming over  billion in the us but what is important to understand i mean patients who use this drug they’re not actually anymore going to the pharmacy for a prescription at a onetime they are now actually  the model is switching to a subscription model where a patient which are now we call them consumer actually orders once a month actually a spray and then subscribe for the whole year and then receive the product to his home or actually we would be able to offer five actuary product at the same time or even more so we look at this as a continuous use of this product by the patients and actually working frankly to keep that as long as possible on the subscription model as once you put it a consumer on subscription model actually now you have eliminated a lot of the sales and marketing costs there is actually now bigger margins there is now a bigger adherence to the brand as to the use there is an ease for that person to receive the product where he is sitting home and doesn’t have and say oh my god i don’t have any more actually quality in my drug i have to go out and buy another one so i think this is really where we come in in our actually beyond human sales and market platform because we’re able to reach a very very large number of people on a monthly basis  million to  million people on a monthly basis is a very large number so basically now those people  a lot of those people are used to this four multi products that we have  that are using as a prescription and then they’re going to see it coming to them now and in otc for theyre used do it they’re comfortable with it and we’ll be able to actually offer them the subscription mode where they can say i’m going to subscribe for this six months for three months for one year in order to continuously keep getting the products and this is where actually i think important to note that with the company looking to increase our actually offering fluticare with additional complementing product we will be able to offer more product as a package to this consumer whereas allergic rhinitis a lot of patients have for example a lot of eye irritation so you have to take eye drop a lot of them have a nasal still they have to clear up their nasal with spaces so there is a lot of additional complementary products that we can add to that and offer to the same consumer without actually adding any more marketing costs so this is where the efficiency of our platform and our subscription model comes in this is where we can increase our margins now without the need to be going and competing with gks competing with bayer or competing with other products so this is where we see ourselves actually have an advantage over the shelf space having said that please note that we publically have to report that indiscernible has actually closed to  stores actually has went up of record already actually in place so we have actually the retails that we will choose from with our products and we have the advantage of our beyond human platform and our online platform which should not be taken lightly as now our subscribers to our website are over  million subscribers to all our website and this is where we’re able to reach an simple email blast coming to them offering them actually the products so i hope this answers your questions daniel it does thank you operator our next question for today is indiscernible from the chesapeake group please go ahead unidentified analyst hi this is indiscernible with chesapeake group and a question for you basically i want to know as far as the proxy whats the reason for that increase in shares bassam damaj so this is a very good question i’m glad that you asked this question so i think the important for the shareholders to know the company currently has  million shares authorized to each one we have a little bit over a  million shares that are outstanding when we did the last round of financing as part of the publically filed documents with the securities and exchange commission we were required to reserve  million shares on that actuary document in order to allow the converse that takes place so this is a reserve that we can touch which actually puts us actuary at not a high number adding to that the company truly believes of the potential approval of the fda before the end of the year and as you know once the fda approval comes in we do actually all indiscernible shareholder the rest of their shares to be issued when we did the acquisition of the company so basically the main reason actually why we did this is to be able to have enough shares actually to be able to continues to execute on our business plan that we have shown it for example acquiring products and without the need to go and pay cash for it or actually potentially use our actuary start for additional acquisition so the company has to have actuary shares and up shares outstanding to be able to continue to execute and this was actually the main reason why we needed to increase our number of authorized share and its not actually for other reasons as we stated in the proxy unidentified analyst thank you i appreciate it operator our next questioner is ed stokes with chesapeake please go ahead ed stokes good afternoon dr bassam how are you today bassam damaj hi ed how are you doing ed stokes great curious about up listing timing  sort of strongly moving to a higher exchange bassam damaj so a higher exchange has a lot of advantages indiscernible we built the company to be a nasdaq company we did not build the company the way the structure is the product the way the revenues are growing to stay on the bulletin board but and as i said in several actuary interviews and i publicly said it out there we will not uplift to just uplift i do not like the reverse splits and i think the shareholders have to know something and to go through the history of the company i actually invested and put in the company  million as a line of credit from my own money when i came in i am the largest  single largest shareholder in the company and i converted a lot of those money actually at  so i think it is important to me when i speak now im not speaking as a ceo of the company but i’m speaking as a shareholder similar to the thousands of the shareholders we have out there is that as a shareholder i do not like to see a reverse split i like to be able to minimize that effect and i will wait until the market conditions are right until my share price is actually at much appreciated and until our shareholders equity actuary could meet to the requirement by nasdaq and then we will look it’s up listing in the nasdaq i think this is very important point i know lot of shareholders actually we do receive indiscernible they were about the reverse split when it’s coming we are not going to do a reverse split on uplift just to uplift we will only uplift when the time is right for the company and for the shareholders so i think this is very important to keep in mind here i am talking not as the ceo of the company but as the largest single shareholder of the company so i am the same size as the shareholder here i hope that answer the question ed stokes yes it does and i just have one other question is it sounds as if the beyond human products are the best performing products at present time would you say the growth is organic or will be from additional products bassam damaj so beyond human  there are two things we have to understand beyond human sales and marketing platform right which under we sell most of our products and then we have the beyond human testosterone indiscernible that is a very good seller for the company but as i mentioned we have integrated now four additional products into this platform and now actually  is actually our lead performer right now as we publically said and again we are seeing the growth not just organic but also integrating all the products we have to add us on the sales platform and here i want to actually give a very important example of how successful weve been able to integrate that and how powerful this platform is to give you an example this vesele product we have which is the best seller product now and as you would see we said we from the first quarter that vesele and the beyond human testosterone added about  of all our products right now and vesele keep to be over performing this is a product that have actually purchased for  actually about a year ago we’re selling  units and as i said in the previous presentation that i had this product right now sells about  units a day this is how strong this platform is we are able to reach so many people and those types of people we reach are people that actually are used to be able to look at those editorials look at those print media they go online this is the type of product they want and we’re able to reach so many of them so it shows you how we took a product that was selling  units a year to sell now  units a day so the growth yes the growth is organic because this product we had before but also we are adding more products to the pipeline so it’s really a combination of organic growth and adding more products to the pipeline ed stokes great better than i’ve thought thank you very much operator our next questioner today is robert scott a private investor please go ahead robert scott hello bassam how are you doing today bassam damaj fine thank you robert robert scott yes your growth had been quite commendable and i am sure you’ve had quite a busy quarter this third quarter congratulations to you bassam damaj thank you robert scott with all that being so busy i was just wondering if you guys are still on track to expend your fluticare franchise by adding more products there bassam damaj definitely i mean as i said the fluticare is a very important asset for us there are a lot of products that can be added around the fluticare franchise we are diligently working to adding more products as i said publicly we are always evaluating and discussion and focus of our product and i hope that we will be able to actually to announce in the near future additional product around the fluticare franchise this is very important for us and as you know we are very strong in the business development area the mergers and acquisitions so we’re always looking for product to add and we’ve added a lot of products on a weekly basis so we are very confident of our ability as to expand that franchise very fast and hopefully before actually we even launched that product into the market robert scott and a quick followup i was looking for you to elaborate a little on you reported earlier a big increase in these prepaid expenses and i was just wondering how this is related to this increase in inventory and just making sure you got enough supply out there to feed this enormous ramp up in demand bassam damaj very good yes and as we reported we had about a lot of prepaid expenses that we had in the company and that actually stems directly from really most of that increase actually prepaid expenses related to product inventory which is very important our reported result for example it’s doing about  units a day so you can imagine how much inventory we have to keep on hand we have vesele we have beyond human testosterone we have sensum we have xyralid we have recalmax we have a very strong pipeline so the management has taken a decision here really aiming to taking some of the money we have and invest in enough adventure enough to have – in order to have a cutaneous supply so this where a lot of the bulk of the prepaid expenses comes in there is a lot if associated actually expenses that goes within as you know the product liabilities and so forth and ensures us that you have to prepay and so forth so these – lot of those actually prepaid expenses that you see in this quarter will carry a lot to the next quarter so it’s very important so it’s not just a prepaid expense for this quarter unfortunately we had to put them in this quarter to take on that expense but a lot of those actually are for several months to come and the last part of your question we do have enough supply of the product as we have a very actually now we have multiple supply of them and many faster sell product and we do maintain what’s called a mil which is a minimum inventory level of each product in there where once we reach that level that we have and automatic actually deal goes out to our manufacturers to start on the new batch in order really to continuously have enough supply robert scott that’s awesome and i’ve had many enquiries people are very interested in getting online there and ordering your product and one thing i am noticing i am going from  million in revenue this year and next year  million but with this added fluticare we’re thinking i am thinking this thing to be like over  million in revenue for you next year is that a possibility or are we being low in that number bassam damaj i always would like to be conservative and this is very important when we moved from our first quarter we did about  in q of this year and we said what we’ve acquired this one and we got actually increase our revenue people were asking i said i don’t know what they’re going to do second quarter we reported over  million of revenues and then again people think maybe this is a onetime thing they were able to do it we reported now  million revenue and  million in revenue actually if you look at it if you look at the  million revenue we did this quarter this is almost three months so you can now estimate how much we’re doing monthly actually on those products and we reported we’re doing a  increase monthtomonth so basically i would like to be conservative again with any management you would like to beat the estimate but our actually guidance is  million  if we get the approval from the fda for fluticare yes we’re looking to add another  million to  million for  and that actually will take us into the number you have suggested but only if we get the approval for fluticare so we’re very actually – this i why we keep working diligently on really preparing the potential launch of the fda of the fluticare while we await for a decision from the fda robert scott thank you i am very excited to be board i can’t wait for this fourth quarter and see the numbers and next year so it’s an exciting ride all the way around bassam damaj thank you thank you i appreciate that i appreciate the support operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to dr damaj for any closing remarks bassam damaj thank you and i would like to thank you for joining our call today for the third quarter of  as i

that id now like to turn the call over to dr bassam damaj dr damaj bassam damaj thank you kerry good afternoon everyone in the first quarter  we drove growth across many areas of our portfolio which enabled us to grow revenues x from  in first quarter  to  million in the first quarter  and grow our product pipeline from four products to  commercial products looking forward we remain confident in reaching profitability exiting  from the ongoing performance of our key franchises and core brands as well as the growing momentum behind our growing pipeline expanding territories and partnerships for our products new product introductions and major product launches including fluticare which we just announced our deed with westward a subsidiary of hikma this week specifically our first quarter  was another record quarter of innvous pharma as we reported  million in net revenues this is approximately an  increase over the prior first quarter  net revenues which totaled  first quarter  revenues also represented close to  increase from the fourth quarter of  which totaled  million in revenues i believe it is important to note that our net cash use and operations for this quarter was a little under  a very sign that we are inching closer to being cash flow positive again and targeting  targeted profitability exiting  in addition our beyond human sales and marketing platform keeps producing outstanding performances which resulted in having now several products generating the majority of our revenues from our six core products which include vesele sensum urivarx zestra recalmax and bht products we have also announced a new product in may  called prostagorx to effectively maintain good prostate health the product targets is very large an unmet medical need markets and with all the new products launched and expected to launch this year the new commercial deals outside the united states we are currently have signed a new ones we expect to announce in the near future we believe we have put forward very achievable and reasonable expectation for  and we continue to work towards profitability the largest milestones in the history of the company it is just impressive to see how the company has grown from  in revenue in first quarter  to  million in first quarter  at this time i would like to discuss our sales channels in the united states to have a better understanding of our business model and growth so we currently sell products through four main channels first our wholesalers and retailers which include several thousand stores in united states two through our on over  web sites at this time through our beyond human and sales marketing platforms which reaches between  million to  million people on a monthly basis and four through our  international distributors and i think important to know that we are working on implementing additional sales channels and we will be updating our investors on our new channel and your channels as we launch them and i also think it is important for our shareholders and the market to know that our success in growing the business stems from the following items first we have a very unique business model and our unique business model is based on our ability and success in licensing andor acquiring additional over the counter monograph and fda approved otc and ndas that will permit us to gain a strong foothold in the rx to otc switch market of the following disease markets first sexual dysfunction second migraine and brain health three prostate diseases bladder diseases and respiratory diseases we also which make us very unique here have an complement those products with clinically tested and validated supplements and consumer care products for the same disease target a very unique business model that have allowed us to gain the trust and the loyalty of consumers hence we see the results with the continuously increasing sales revenues second our ability to register our products outside the united states and find good international commercial partners and actually start generate revenues from those markets for a very small company like innovus is a testament to the experienced proven track records of the management and the uniqueness and proven business model we have third our ability to bring in or develop new targets continuously and the main targets are few areas we target and fourth our ability to continue to optimize our current sales platforms and i think the results we announced today with our gross margin continuously increasing is really the proof that the optimization and the strategy we are undertaking is working very well as expected and the continuous optimization of our sales platforms and the addition of new sales platforms and revenues will continuously improve our margins and our profits now i would like to discuss three specific topics that im sure the shareholders are waiting to hear from us first fluticare so as you know we have been waiting on the approval of the anda of the otc anda with our current partner which has taken longer than anticipated and since we cannot control the review process by the agency we have moved forward with signing the supply agreement with another company called westward which is a subsidiary hikma pharmaceuticals which already have and have recently got the approval of their otc anda for fluticasone propionate nasal spray for innovus to be able to launch now fluticare under the recently approved anda and as by the first quarter of this year again we expect now to launch fluticare and the fourth quarter of this year under the approved anda and under the agreement with westward the agreement calls for the innovus to commit annual minimum purchase requirements for the duration of the agreement and we will not have to pay westward anything else for this relationship we will be launching the  spray version of the drug in generic states which is currently the only commercially viable dose and once launched by innovus fluticare will be the third national brand in the us after gsks flonase and bayers clarispray and i think it is important to note here that westward awarded only to terigo ph which is a very large pharma the rights to supply what is called the store brands only and shows innovus for the national brands i mean this is a testament to the confidence in our commercial abilities and our recognized fluticare brand to compete with gsk and bayer and this very large over  billion market in the us this is a big accomplishment for the company to be in the same space as last pharma with a drug targeting over  billion market so we expect to reach gross revenues from the sale of fluticare within month of launching the drug of approximately  million to  million to supply now that our drug launch is in the very close horizon we are tirelessly working on preparing our physician sampling and working with our retailers and all of our online print media sales channels to be ready for the launch in the fourth quarter of this year i will now give you some additional details on the projected launch process of the channels so first we intent to do a sampling to the top  subscribers of the fluticasone propionate in the united states as we are working to finalize agreements with our over  retail stores with which we are already vendor of record and to launch fluticare under our beyond human sales and marketing platform reaching  million to  million people on a monthly basis along or in conjunction with the other product that we have in the same space like our allervarx tablets for allergy symptom management and fourth we plan to launch fluticare online through our robust online platforms including our web sites and including over  million subscribers that we currently have and through amazon and i think this summarizes right now the timing of the launch the processes we are taking to prepare the launch and we have continued to update you on the progress of the launch and once the launch is done now i would like to talk more about vesele which is still our leading product in terms of sales and im very happy to announce that the first set of results of the combination of our supplement vesele was sildenafil sold as viagra in the us by pfizer rn the company is finalizing the statistical analysis of the data and we hope to be able to announce that data very soon the sexual dysfunction is a very large market and vesele is the only product to our knowledge that has been studied in a human and showed significant effects on penile harness and maintenance and those are very complemented end points to the pd inhibitors on the market so once all the studies are completed we see vesele as the major supplement along with the pd inhibitors especially if the fda approves the rx to the otc switch anda of the cialis low form ph that was filed by sanofi who is lillys partner in the united states and just to remind the investors that the patents for cialis expires in  in the united states so having a blockbuster drug patent expire will allow now the generic to hit the market and having sanofi do all the leg work to be able to switch the drug from rx to the otc for the lower dose will give us a great opportunity now once this happens to be able to push vesele alongside with at least cialis generics if approved as otc since we believe that vesele has a great potential not just in the us we are anticipating and working very hard for finding for approval with additional country to expand our territories and revenues from this product and we will keep the market appraise on the progress of filing in different countries third i want to talk our beyond human sales and marketing platform which as i mentioned before reaches between  million to  million in the us on a monthly basis i mean this platform since we acquired this in march last year has been performing consistently performing with great returns to innvous and im pleased to announce that we are in the process of expanding the sales of marketing platform to canada as the first country the canadian market is expected to be between  to  of the us market and successful in our introduction to canada we should expect to add between  million to  million in additional revenues in the first  months of launch from products like vesele and grow from there with that i will turn the call over to rauly our vp of finance to discuss with you our detailed financial results rauly rauly gutierrez thank you bassam as bassam mentioned we recorded revenues in the first quarter of  totaling  million products contributing to our revenues included vesele urivarx sensum bht zestra and recalmax this represented  increase over the previous years first quarter and on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis a  increase equally impressive our gross margins for the first quarter were approximately  which is significantly higher than our first quarter of  gross margins of approximately  we believe this highlights the strength of our beyond human platform and the efficiencies we have been able to create by adding our existing products such as vesele zestra recalmax urivarx and sensum on to this platform we will continue to look for ways to optimize our gross margins in the following quarters our net used  our net cash used in operations was  for the quarter compared to  million for the previous fourth quarter of  we believe this represents great progress as we move towards our goal of becoming cash flow positive by exiting  sales and marketing expense increased to  million in the first quarter of  this was primarily driven by the increase in the number of print and online media advertisements of our existing products through the beyond human platform the increase is also attributable to increased cost in sales and marketing support services due to the high volume of our sales orders on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues as decreased by over  when compared to the fourth quarter of  and by over  when compared to the third quarter of  we expect this to continue to moderate as a percentage of sales going forward as we see customers utilizing more and more of the subscription model to purchase our products and we continue to conduct more targeted print and online media advertisements general and administrative expenses increased to  million in the first quarter this amount did however include noncash stockbased compensation to  as well as noncash depreciation and amortization expense of  first quarter general and administrative expenses represented almost  decrease from the fourth quarter  and an approximate  decrease as a percentage of revenues when compared to the same for the fourth quarter of  most importantly loss from operations for the first quarter of  was  million which i said before includes  of noncash stockbased compensation and amortization this represents a decrease of  from the fourth quarter of  and  from the third quarter of  a loss from operations as a percentage of revenues has decreased by  from the fourth quarter of  and  from the third quarter of  so as we continue to look at different ways to control operating costs and conduct more targeted print and online media advertisements we believe this trend of decrease in our loss from operations continues to demonstrate our progress to reach our goal of profitability at march   our cash balance has grew to  million as compared to  at december   the increase from the cash balance is due to the  million we received in net cash proceeds from the registered public offering which we completed in march  with the proceeds from the public offering we have been able to strengthen our balance sheet by paying in full the remaining  convertible debentures of  million eliminating the associated embedded conversion future derivative liability of  an increase in our stock flows equity to over  million with that id like to turn the call back over to bassam bassam damaj thank you rauly the pieces are falling in place towards achieving our current main goals for  first the first goal id like to talk about is the successful launch of fluticare the fluticare is the major product for the company and executing a successful launch is a must for us to ensure meeting the projected revenues from this product between to  million to  million alone and gaining a significant market share of the overthecounter  over  billion market that we are targeting second expanding the number of international distributors for our core products an increase in revenues from the sale this is important why because exus sales through our partners do not have any sale on or marketing cost for us and the revenues hit our bottomline which will allow us to hit profitability factor third continue to license andor acquire additional companies technologies or products and the otc and the otc anda spaces in the therapeutic areas that we are targeting fourth and most important is to reach profitability exiting  i believe the revenue growth we have been experiencing along with the additional product launches expected this year the commercial partnerships and increase in revenues that we expect from the current products and from the fluticares projected launch in the fourth quarter we will pave the way to achieve our goal our yeartoyear growth is closed to eightfold and we are achieving gross margin of about  as a result we are currently confident with our ability to achieve profitability exiting  and i believe you heard from rauly that most of our losses are noncash based losses and i think this is very important to note and the more we are able to decrease our use of net cash the factor we get to profitability i mean we have accomplished a lot in the first quarter of  and then subsequent time period prior to this earnings call and as a summary to some of the important highlights of this period include one we closed  million in equity financing with the additional potential of  million in shortterm orders and another  million in longterms orders and i think this is important for us why because for a company on the bulletin board and in our space it is not easy to do equity financing as you have seen its mainly related to note and convertible note so doing this equity financing actually really makes a big difference to us and also i think it is important for us that we have paid back the left over of the convertible notes and we do not have anymore convertible notes on our books second we increased our otc drug supplements and consumer care products to  third we were able to secure an approved otc anda for fluticare to launch in the united states and will enable us once we launch it as innovus for fluticare to be one of only three national brands in the united states with currently anticipated revenues into  million to  million range on a calendar basis from the launches we continue our corporate and business development efforts to increase the number of otc anda drugs otc drugs and clinically validated supplement and consumer care products and to license and develop our own proprietary products you saw we just launched another product in a very large area  as area with prostagorx and we look forward to continuously updating you on the expected launches that we have upcoming as we previously disclosed and we continue to grow our international sales of our products through key marketing approvals of zestra and sensum which we announced not long time ago in  countries of the european union and we are working on increasing the number of approvals in the next few quarters and finally which is most important for us is that we continue the road to becoming profitable exiting  in conclusion first id like to thank our shareholders who have invested with us and have been  loyal to us and have believed in our successful business model allowing us to be one of the main companies in the otc switch space supplement and consumer care business as we have shown in the acquisition of the rise of the anda otc for fluticare although we are a small to public company but we have an experienced management team who remains committed to working for the company and the shareholders to increase the revenues and profitability of the company and to develop market and sell products that can have an immediate beneficial impact on our patients life and with this id like to thank you for listening to our call we will now open the floor for questions from the audience questionandanswer session operator ladies and gentlemen at this time well begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from jay albany from seethruequity please go ahead with your question jay albany hi guys congratulations on the growth  execution this quarter i had a quick question in terms of achieving positive margins and revenue what kind of revenue levels are you targeting to achieve adjusted profitability on a quarterly basis bassam damaj so we have not actually given projections on a reported basis but we have  actually have discussed between  million to  million should put us in the profitability we are targeting jay albany okay great bassam damaj and with the new  again with the new products were launching with the expected ones we are launching and as i mentioned with the new additional partnership we expect to announce we have really pushing to be profitable ahead of those numbers hopefully so but what really guide us was to be able to exit profitable anyway between  million to  million revenues jay albany thats great i had a good question your margins  your gross margins have really expanded lately is that mostly from the new sales platform is there anything you can say to expand on how thats been  you have been achieving that and what we should think about bassam damaj yes i mean the increase in the margin  actually its two main things first of all we are now much more  now that we have under our belt about a year experience in the sales and all the platform we have we now are able to do more targeted campaigns as rauly discussed in there and those targeted campaigns actually have really yielded much more results to us and that actually help push the margins up quite a bit we also actually have some exus sales which also doesnt have any sales and marketing cost to us which also helps from the bottomline but definitely its a combination of things but primarily its actually our ability to optimize our sales and marketing platform by having a much more targeted campaigns and targeted areas for us that allows us actually to get much better return on the investments jay albany thank you just one more if i could then i will bid farewell ph what else in terms of fluticare thats exciting news could you expand on sort of the timing and expectations you have to get to  million to  million from the first year commercial operations bassam damaj sure i mean we announced the signing of the partnership just this tuesday as you know as we mentioned before i mean it takes few months we can get the first batch of the drug we have also in the meantime some fighting on the label and the box and so forth we have to so we expect the launch to be in the fourth quarter of this year from the time of the launch we expect between  million to  million in revenues from fluticare and then from there the revenues should go up as we have much more market penetration in the us jay albany great thanks so much congratulations bassam damaj thank you jay operator our next question comes from james painter from springboard capital please go ahead with your question james painter bassam congratulations on the quarter ive actually got four questions here first one is terms of your convertible debt last year are you able to take care of all of that or is there still any lingering out there bassam damaj well as ive mentioned actually the company does not have any convertible debt at all we paid all the remaining convertible debt with the rates we did so i can actually tell you there is zero remaining and the convertible debt on the book so weve cleaned the books quite a bit james painter okay thats encouraging in terms of the shareholder equity i know there is a  million requirement for the nasdaq have you closed on that can you talk a little bit about that as well bassam damaj so we are actually a little bit over  million in positive shareholder equity at this time as you know nasdaq requires  million shareholders equity so we are inching little by little towards positive shareholder equity but were not there yet james painter okay great thank you and my final question is going to be in terms of innovus as a potential acquisition do you  you see any national brands that were potentially be acquisitive towards innovus talk about that a little bit brief bassam damaj yes i mean listen were continuously looking at national brands that are complementary to our brands right so i cannot discuss in specific details which ones were looking at were reevaluating but i consider that we evaluate a lot of opportunities on a monthly basis and we are actually continuously looking to bring in national brands to our pipeline i think it is an important question because as you know natural brands are what makes a difference for a company and what establishes a company as a market leader in some therapeutic areas so this is for us an important part on a business development side to be able to bring in national brands james painter fantastic thats enough out of me thank you very much for your time bassam damaj thank you jim operator our next question comes from prashant mehta from pm advisors please go ahead with your question prashant mehta yes bassam bassam and the team congratulations guys quickly its very clear that bassam you are excited about the fluticare ive heard a lot of good stuff i heard dates can you clarify the third quarter fourth quarter launch and whats maybe this might be a repeat but i do want some clarification on what behind the scenes between now and the launch to prepare you for the launch thats my first question and the second question is regarding your anda filing can you give us some update on the progress outside the us please thank you bassam damaj sure for the first question i mean we do not expect to have the product available until the fourth quarter of this year so our really projected launch is the fourth quarter of this year what were doing behind the scenes what we have been doing and what we continuously do in there i mean i think it is important that when we acquired  we acquired them for multiple reasons not just for the fluticare as a national brand not just because there was already a overthecounter otc anda filed by our partners but also because they were vendor of record with over  stores in the united states i think this is important because we do want to start from scratch and go on and build those relationships we had already as a vendor of records so now what the team is really working on that we have secured the anda to be able to launch this product is really working very hard and aggressively to really finalize the agreement with those stores and finalize the format for how the product should be shipped and the skus and so forth in order to be able to place it as soon as we received the product from westward and our distribution centers this is one the second which is important and i think the market i talked about that in my previous calls i mean the market for fluticasone propionate sprayed once it switch from rx to otc is no longer a market where the patient takes out of scripts and go give it to the pharmacist whatever the pharmacist gives him as a genetic takes at home this is the market that has evolved to where now patients are buying up to six units at the same time patients are looking to subscribe to a model where they get the product shipped to them on a monthly basis where the product is more cheaply and most efficient to them the market where those patients dont just use fluticasone on in its own they use eye drops with it they use nasal dosage nasal sprays in order to clear the softness then they use the fluticasone so there is a whole  a new market that opens and this is where we come in we have now product like allervarx weve licensed like the nasal dose and supplement were looking to introduce where were able now to set fluticare and offer with it those additional products so now the customer can come in and say what now ill take fluticare it is a very good price position price point for me ill buy two to five units at the same time ill take with it allervarx i will take with it nasal spray from one all the while im sitting home and then they can ship on a monthly basis what i need and i think where we are unique in this model is that you have to remember that if you go to clarispray from bayer you go to buy flonase  these are available in the retail stores only so retail stores and some resellers online dont offer the monthly auto ship option that we actually offer to our customers so we have this advantage over that and we have the other advantages that we already have a loyal base that is out there we have  million subscribers to our web site we continuously reach  million to  million actually potential buyers of fluticare on a monthly basis from our human sales and marketing platform we are working on building and adding additional sales channels for us we also have those retail stores that were going to put the product on but i think also more importantly is that we are preparing to do a sampling to the top  physician prescribers of the fluticasone propionate as you know a lot of those big pharma that when a product is now genetic disease that is little to know sampling that is done to this now you go to the doctor he wont give you a free flonase or a free clarispray sample because there is none they dont do it anymore he says you go and buy it from the stores whereas us being able now to do the steps to putting fluticare in there here are some free samples give it to your patients the patient now looks at this in a different way so we will be doing this as we do all the different steps that we are working on to really achieve a successful launch of the product now coming for the second question on the current anda that was filed by our partner i mean listen we publicly said we dont control the process in the us so what we have done we were able to find another partner to be able to launch it and weve done that at the same time we are still actually working towards getting and prepare to get additional guidance for fluticare outside the us as i mentioned before we started this process in europe by going through the uk the uk decided to have their brexit so now its no longer approved as part of the eu guidance so we have to go and look what is currently  what is the best country for us to go and ask for guidance to file for it in addition we are actually looking for guidance in canada we are looking for guidance in the middle east north africa and additional countries i dont know if you know but this actually does take time and usually when you start actually those  when you start those guidance i think this is important to note that in order to launch or file for a product in countries like middle east north africa because what is required is the cpp the certificate of pharmaceutical product in the country of origin which means we have to sell the product first in the us to be able to issue that cpp for the potential partners we have we will get out there so for us although were working towards preparing for the guidance we will actually need to do it under the fourth quarter until we really been able to really start that process seriously and do the finding so i hope that answers the question prashant mehta thats good thank you so much bassam good luck bassam damaj thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen our final question today comes from robert scott ph please go ahead with your question unidentified analyst hello bassam weve been talking about europe a lot switching over to south korea what part of that  million deals have you received or youve seen any of it yet or when its coming bassam damaj sure so we signed the deal with gnh ph and korea and the agreement with them calls for a minimum of  million a year in order to keep the exclusive license as you know for south korea we had the  our partner had to receive the approval actually to market the produce there and i think we are now the approval for korea only in march and for that to be able to import the product and i have to say i mean we actually do have orders from our partner in korea already and this is very fact from being able to get approval in march and then be able to ship but as we mentioned before we already actually shipped the first order we received for this around three pack to that we recognized  of that and we do have another active purchase order from our partner for the multidose and we are working to work fulfilling that purchase order and we continue to work with our partner to get additional orders to fulfill and but our partners seems to be very confident on their ability actually to do the  million and from indiscernible south korea and thats actually something we are keen for us to happen unidentified analyst thank you and one last quick question how many products now do you have on the market and do you plan to introduce any more new ones bassam damaj so currently we have  products on the market in the united states and we are working on introducing for  another six to eight new products our target really  we want to be over  products in us and again i think its important to note here so the goal is not really to introduce a lot of product the goal is to introduce products that we believe will be product for us  blockbuster products these are the type of products that weve look to introduce in markets where there is unmet medical needs unmet need in there and products that are very complementary in the same therapeutic areas for the actual drugs that we have or bringing into market that unidentified analyst thank you i appreciate that it looks great bassam damaj thank you operator ladies and gentlemen at this time we will conclude our questionandanswer session id like to turn the conference call back over to dr damaj for any closing remarks bassam damaj thank you in closing id like to thank everybody

following brief excerpt from the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals report expert analysts discuss the outlook for the sector and for investorsdr bassam damaj was appointed to serve as president and chief executive officer and as a member of the board in december  and was elected as chairman of the board in october  he is the cofounder and former chief scientific officer of bioquant and served in that capacity since its inception in  before bioquant dr damaj served as president and ceo of biosignature diagnostics inc he also served as the group leader for the office of new target intelligence and a group leader for immunological and inflammatory disease programs at tanabe research laboratories usa inc dr damaj holds a phd in immunologymicrobiology a postdoctoral fellowship in molecular oncology and an mba in health caretwst would we start with an overview and history of apricus biosciencesdr damaj apricus biosciences apri is a public pharmaceutical company were listed on the nasdaq under the symbol apri the company focuses on enhancing pharmaceutical products since its founding the company has advanced many products through clinical development and also approval we have in canada vitaros for erectile dysfunction a strong pipeline and are close to receiving market authorization for vitaros in europe in addition we have three marketed products in the united states for oncology and oncologysupported care that we have acquiredtwst would you talk about the technology involved in your nexact systems and its related pipelinedr damaj at the core of apricus is a drugdelivery technology called nexact which is a unique patented smallmolecule technology designed to allow drug delivery through what we call tight junctions that hold the cells together and allow the drug to go through the skin and what nexact technology allows is really for enhancing and allowing drugs that usually dont go through the skin or other routes to go through the skin noninvasively and achieve higher levels in blood to achieve the efficacy needed from those drugs and again when you do that youre able sometimes to use less of the drug and if the drug has any side effects then you can have lower of those side effects and the improvement that we really made possible with the nexact technology  they hold the potential to provide compounds with what we call ncelike differentiation and nce stands for new chemical entities which have very strong patent protectiontwst would you tell us about the companys plans to market vitaros a male erectile dysfunction product as well as the female sexual arousal product called femprox what partnerships and relationships are in place for those productsdr damaj our strategy is really to develop and play an active role in the commercialization of our nexactenhanced formulations of proven and wellcharacterized drugs that usually address a large patient population so to accomplish this the strategy is to work both independently through our own sales force for some of the products as well as have partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies such as our partners abbott novartis sandoz warner chilcott as they share the same goals and have the right strategic sales force and marketing to push the drugs into the markettwst where will this lead apricus with the experience gained on these products what are the next likely suspectsdr damaj our flagship product is a drug called vitaros which is approved in canada its going to be launched the second half of this year with abbott laboratories and it is currently the only topical treatment approved for erectile dysfunction in the world and this product actually does not have the side effects that the oral pde like viagra cialis and levitra have it is the only product that we call an ondemand treatment which the patients would add the product and within minutes the patients will have a response and its currently the only product that is safe and effective for the entire patient population that the oral pde will not work for im leading with this because this actually shows the strength of the technology and what we can do following on vitaros success we have developed a very strong pipeline is the second of which is femprox for female sexual arousal disorder which is a combination of our nexact and alprostadilits a topical gel which we already completed a phase iii clinical trials successfully were following with mycova which is a combination of terbinafine and nexact for onychomycosis which is a fungus infection of the nail we have prevonco which is a combination of lansoprazole and nexact for hepatocellular carcinoma for cancer in addition we have acquired a series of drugs in the oncology and oncologysupportive care space like granisol currently the only marketed and approved granisetron product for vomiting and nausea associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapywe have also totect which is the only drug actually approved for the treatment of extravasation of chemotherapy to help actually the survival of the patient and remove the excess of the chemotherapy that will destroy the tissues so with this now we have moved from a clinicalstage development company to what we call a commercialstage company and with a commercialstage company we do have our own revenues and pushing for more revenuesthe wall
