stockholderproposals q how would the broadbased proposals affect me as a fund shareholder o changing the designation of a funds investment objective from fundamental to nonfundamental will not alter any funds current investment objective but it will allow a funds board to make future adjustments to the investment objective without having to obtain shareholder approval shareholders would however receive advance written notice of any proposed changes management does not currently intend to recommend any material changes to the investment objective of any fund o adopting a standardized list of fundamental investment restrictions across all funds would modernize the restrictions to meet all current regulatory requirements and would provide operational efficiencies and make it easier to monitor compliance with these restrictions o designating all existing investment restrictions as nonfundamental would not change the way a fund is currently managed or operated but would allow a funds board to analyze and approve changes to the funds existing investment restrictions without having to obtain additional shareholder approval over time management expects to recommend that the board evaluate each funds investment restrictions so that those restrictions can be modernized and standardized if appropriate o approval of the proposed fee increases fee decreases or potential fee decreases through the introduction of breakpoints for certain funds would ensure management fee levels that will enable those funds to have competitive fee structures and continue to receive high quality investment management services o approval of new standardized investment management agreements for each fund and standardized subadvisory agreements where applicable would help provide operational efficiencies o the restructuring of funds from their current form of organization into delaware business trusts would provide both consistency across the delaware investments fund family and greater flexibility of fund operations q how do the board members for my fund recommend that i vote the board members for all the funds recommend that you vote in favor of or for all of the

consecutive month of lackluster returns and the equity markets were on their way to finishing their worst year since  january   recap of events  as of november   the us stock market had just turned in a third consecutive month of lackluster returns and the equity markets were on their way to finishing their worst year since  major us equity indexes were down year to date with the technologyheavy nasdaq composite index off a notable  year to date and almost  from its march th peak there are a number of factors arguably contributing to the troubles including high oil prices tensions in the middle east corporate earnings disappointments and tightening by an inflationwary us federal reserve board early in  it is also clear that many investors and analysts in  began reassessing stock valuations for companies that play a role in the new economy in december  and through the first two months of  growth stocks were completing a monumental price boom that was often led by hopeful prospects for technology and in particular for internetrelated companies the rest of  was a reverse image of that speculative environment however many technology stocks lost significant value in the spring leading the broad market downward the entire market has generally been volatile ever since and as a result we have seen an increased focus on corporate fundamentals as the year has progressed we believe this newfound focus on fundamentals can be a positive development as it helps move stocks toward values from which we can be optimistic about future returns delaware blue chip fund by definition of its investment strategy focuses on stocks that have both growth and value characteristics it holds stocks from a diverse array of industries including banking energy healthcare technology and telecommunications the fund focuses on blue chip companies  those with large market capitalizations that typically have lengthy records of profit growth sound management teams and reputations for quality products and services total return for the period ended november   one year  delaware blue chip fund class a shares   standard  poors  index  russell top  index  lipper

classes can be found on page  in the past the funds benchmark was the sp  index which measures the performance of mostly largecapitalization us companies the fund now uses the russell top  index as

to outperform its benchmark the russell top  index which returned  for the same period difficult times in the stock market call for longterm mutual fund investors to remain disciplined down markets can represent opportunities we believe that investors who stick to a regular investment plan diversify their assets and keep a longterm outlook are generally well prepared regardless of shortterm market direction as always we recommend that investors continue to rely on basic sound principles of investing for help with your financial plan or with assessing your own risk tolerance and financial goals contact your financial adviser market outlook  the factors mentioned above as contributing to this years market woes are almost identical to those seen in  that year was the last in which the dow jones industrial average the nasdaq composite index and the sp  index all finished down for the year the difference is that in  the us economy was in recession we believe that the federal reserve is currently achieving the soft landing it sought for the us economy and that investors various concerns are already reflected in the market although we expect market volatility may continue it is our opinion that declining stock prices positive fundamentals and a healthy economic backdrop make the current environment for equity investing quite attractive on the pages that follow delaware blue chip

year ended november   class a shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested the fund outperformed its benchmark the russell top  index which returned  for the same period by its nature the fund allocates a good portion of its portfolio to stocks of large technology and growth companies which were especially hard hit by the volatile market conditions we seek out companies with a history of profit growth and shareholder dividends we use a combination of quantitative models and fundamental research to pick what we believe are undervalued or mispriced securities we also attempt to maintain an allocation that generally reflects the overall markets composition a primary reason the fund performed below our expectations was our investment in large technology companies which were especially hard hit by the volatile market conditions following strong performance for large technology and growth stocks early in  the tide turned and many large growth stocks  particularly blue chip technology stocks  fell sharply however because the fund is well diversified  holdings as of november   and does not hold a high percentage of stocks in any particular sector the negative impact from the technology sector was somewhat minimized portfolio highlights apple computer dell computer and hewlettpackard were among the stocks that had the greatest impact on the funds performance both apple and dell fell substantially in price during the latter half of our fiscal year as revenues and earnings projections began to fall for computer manufacturers other pcrelated stocks hurt performance as well during the period including micron technology and microsoft microsofts price dropped quite precipitously when the company lost its antitrust case poor performance in the technology sector was partially offset by a solid showing by some brokerage stocks as the financial industry was dominated by merger and acquisition activity in addition to actual acquisitions speculation about possible deals caused other stocks to rise we were fortunate to own painewebber which was acquired by swiss financial giant ubs warburg as well as a g edwards whose stock price rose in relation to brokerage stocks overall but which remained independent we sold our position in painewebber in july  however after the announcement of the takeover  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th delaware blue

goods  electronics  electrical equipment  telecommunications  one area where our performance was enhanced by holding a smaller percentage of stocks was longdistance telecommunication stocks these stocks generally performed particularly poorly especially att and worldcom some media stocks in the portfolio also turned in disappointing performance including walt disney and time warner time warner started the period very positively after the announcement that it would be acquired by america online but the stock faltered later in the year within consumer staples quaker oats and best foods benefited from acquisition interest by pepsico and unilever respectively with prices rising from the time a takeover was first rumored these were cases in which we bought stocks because they were fundamentally attractive and then benefited from acquisitions market outlook because many blue chip stocks have suffered declines in the past few months we view them as well positioned for future growth while the accumulated impact of higher energy prices interest rates and uncertainty about the direction of the us economy have caused some softness in prices and earnings we believe economic fundamentals are still sound we expect the fund to benefit over the long term from our technology holdings we also see good opportunities in the healthcare sector we remain committed to our disciplined objective approach to selecting stocks with potential for longterm growth as we believe this strategy positions us to take advantage of new market opportunities as they arise
