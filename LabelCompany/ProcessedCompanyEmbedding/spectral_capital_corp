capital corp otcmktsfccn  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»spectral capital corp an email promoted company which could rapidly drop  or morenov  about spectral capital fccn investor protection association short onlysummarywe have received numerous emails touting fccn from stock promoters who have been paid to promote itthe timing of the email messages promoting fccn coincides with what seems to be an abnormal rise in the price and trading volume of the stockthere are shares of fccn out there held by promoters or a third party ready to be dumped into the marketaccording to the companys income statement its current financials and future seem extremely bleakwe have not contacted the company but there is no phone number listed on the fccn website online contact form which raises further questions about the legitimacy of the companynote this article is about a nanocap stock while all investments are risky nanocap stocks are among the most risky among nanocap stocks the most risky stocks are those which are subject to promotional campaigns such as spectral capital corp otcqbfccn they are also among the most illiquid stocks usually having a large spread between the bid and ask at any given moment quite often it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position fccn is no exception to that fccn is a nanocap stock which is traded on the otc markets and priced well below the  mark the readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article introduction spectral capital corp is a company trading at a price which has recently ran from a low of  to a high of  in just a few days in this article we will outline the facts which are in our opinion related to the sudden increase in the price of this usually thinlytraded low volume stock the promotion the trading volume of fccn set a record on november th reaching an alltime high of more than one million shares on that very day the price of fccn has experienced a sharp increase not surprisingly these signs of unusual stock price and volume activity have occurred exactly a day after the day on which we received a number of promotional emails from various stock promoters touting the stock which happened on november th obviously we do not consider the emails being sent out and the sudden rise in volume and price to be a coincidence the reality zero revenue negative net income huge dreams as it often happens with aggressively promoted companies a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture it seems that spectral capital corp is of no exception to that rule in our opinion it is clear that the market capitalization let alone current price of fccn has nothing in common with the stocks true value if we take a look at fccns income statement we would see that the companys revenue has remained exactly zero during the entire year of  while its net income has remained negative during that period of time it is based on the aforementioned data that we firmly believe that fccns current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at overinflated prices rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market but why you ask the reason why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised that is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock the answer for this hides of course in the small print let us have a look at some of the disclaimers found in the promotional emails touting fccn which weve received in simple plain english someone  may it be the promoter sending out the email message or a third party which had paid the promoter in cash for sending the message  is holding shares of fccn and plans to get rid of them dump them in the open market therefore our conclusion is that the promotional emails sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices while the promoters or third party unload their shares upon them conclusion it is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article that we hold the opinion that fccn shares are essentially worthless we believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities touting investors to buy the stock this practice is well known see pump and dump and is done exclusively for one reason only  so the insiders can unload dump their shares which they had previously acquired for almost free in the free market onto unsuspecting investors while taking advantage of the stocks inflated price in view of that we would recommend any investor who had purchased shares of the company to liquidate his entire position immediately even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing our recommendation hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man  friedrich nietzsche for longs if you are long the stock get out immediately it is with full confidence we believe that every upward movement in the stocks price is merely temporary as it will never repeat its previous highs we believe fccn has a price target of around  which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks or months at most if you have already accrued losses on the stock sell now so as to avoid additional losses do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many we believe fccns stock price will drop  or more in the following weeks cut your losses by selling now look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy profit from folly rather than participate in it  warren buffett for shorts bearing the aforementioned facts in mind we believe sophisticated investors will quickly apprehend the idea that shorting fccn may be a lucrative opportunity as we are convinced that the potential downside for fccn is substantial if you are able to locate borrows we would advise shorting fccn as its price may prove to be highly inflated disclosure the author is short fccn the author wrote this article themselves and it expresses
