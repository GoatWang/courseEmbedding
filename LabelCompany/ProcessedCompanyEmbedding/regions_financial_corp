rfcs outside auditor while the irs has been successful litigating the merits of what it considers to be abusive shelters it has largely met with failure in attempting to override evidentiary protections such as the work product doctrine click here to view the decision in connection with the tax audit of rfc for the  through  tax years in april  the irs issued a summons to rfcs outside auditor ernst  young ey requesting all tax accrual workpapers that ey had created or assembled in connection with its audit of rfc during the course of the audit the irs had determined that rfc had participated in two listed transactions during the audited tax years and pursuant to its tax accrual workpaper policy the irs sought all the tax accrual workpapers relating to the  and  tax years although for the  tax year the irs sought only the workpapers relating to the listed transactions rfc moved to quash the summons on grounds of work product work product protects from disclosure documents and tangible things that are created in anticipation of litigation see fed r civ pr b eventually the dispute narrowed to four tax opinions from rfcs tax advisors that were in eys files rfc instructed ey to decline to produce four tax opinions three authored by its outside tax counsel alston  bird and one authored by tax professionals at ey who were separate from the audit team rfc claimed that these opinions were protected by work product rfc also claimed that certain portions of several other documents that referenced the tax opinions were also protected under work product the tax opinions discussed a transaction in which an existing reit subsidiary of rfc issued new preferred stock that was subsequently acquired by the european reconstruction and development bank the erdb transaction the district court ruled that the documents at issue were protected work product and like the judge in textron suggested that the preparation of analyses with respect to contingent tax liabilities is fundamentally an action carried out in anticipation of litigation the court did not resolve the uncertainty as to the standard for application of work product in the th circuit to which the case would be appealed instead the court said that under either the more restrictive primary purpose test or the less restrictive because of litigation test the documents met the requirements for work product protection supporting afidavits were critical to work product claim there was no dispute between the parties that the opinions at issue contained rfcs advisors analyses regarding the merits of the consent dividend treatment of the erbd transaction thus the content of the documents was consistent with rfcs claim of work product protection indeed the irs did not attempt to argue that its need for the information and facts contained in the opinions should overcome rfcs claim of work product as it was entitled to do under fed r civ pr b document hosted at httpwwwjdsupracompostdocumentvieweraspxfidafccbfcbdefffa this showed that the irs was not interested in obtaining facts regarding the transaction – it taxpayer’s rfc conceded that the irs was entitled to the facts “rfc’s lawyers” “the contested documents protect” parties’ a showing sufficient work – this is rarely an open question however if the document is created moreover rfc’s rfc’s rfc’s the affidavits submitted by rfc established that rfc’s “of” the minority the “of” the prospect of litigationin roxworthy would follow “‘litigation’ test” “test” the court avoided a definitive tests the fact that regions rfc’s showing “litigation” irs’s the court wrote service’s sic “protection” intended if the contested documents had the irs indeed this showed that wanted to see the taxpayers legal analysis rfc conceded that the irs was entitled to the facts based on its in camera review in which the court found that the documents contained the mental impressions and opinions of rfcs lawyers the court noted that the contested documents contain precisely the kind of legal analysis that the work product doctrine exists to protect slip op at  the court cited united states v roxworthy  fd   th cir  for the statement that this factor weighs in favor of recognizing the documents as protected because of the parties positions the arguments before the court focused on whether the work product doctrine applied not on whether the irs had made a showing suficient to override those protections because of need to obtain the facts work product depends on the purpose for the creation of the document sought to be protected from disclosure was it created in anticipation of litigation this is rarely an open question for documents prepared in connection with actual or imminent litigation however if the document is created before even a threat of litigation as here and in textron the question is potentially debatable moreover because rfcs opinions were used in the course of the ey audit to support rfcs tax reserves in the financial statements this case raised the issue argued by the irs that the documents were created not because of possible litigation but because of financial reporting requirements once again though as in textron careful presentation of key testimony was critical to rfcs victory the afidavits submitted by rfc established that  rfcs general counsel solicited the tax opinions  the general counsel was concerned with the prospect of litigation regarding the erbd transaction  rfc solicited the tax opinions from outside tax advisors because of the anticipated conflict with the irs and  rfc outside counsel and ey would maintain the confidentiality of the documents the court endorses the because of test the central argument in the case concerned the appropriate work product test the minority view advocated by the irs is that the primary motivating purpose for the creation of the document must be to assist in pending or impending litigation the majority view is that the document must be created because of the prospect of litigation the majority view thus extends the protection of work product to documents that have been created earlier in time than actual commencement or threat of litigation and to documents that may have a dual purpose in their creation in roxworthy for example the sixth circuit recognized work product protection for a tax opinion from an outside accounting firm even though the document may have served both a litigation preparation and penalty protection purpose the district court after a lengthy consideration of competing case law in the fifth and eleventh circuits did not definitely resolve which test the eleventh circuit would follow however it stated that if it were forced to decide the question the court concludes that the th circuit would align itself with the majority of the other courts of appeal and adopt the because of litigation test rather than the primary motivating purpose test slip op at  the court avoided a definitive ruling on which test would be adopted by finding that rfc prevailed under both tests here the evidence supplied by rfc carried the day for even under the more restrictive primary motive test the court summarized its view regarding the purpose for which the documents were created it was clear in this case that regions was primarily motivated by litigation when it solicited opinions about the potential outcomes of litigation from alston  bird and ey the fact that regions undertook the time and expense of consulting outside firms to assess its potential liabilities shows that it believed litigation to be likely and this court cannot say that rfcs subjective belief was objectively unreasonable slip op at  emphasis in original showing that it preferred the more inclusive because of litigation test the court vigorously shredded the irss argument that rfc had to prove that the opinions were not used for financial reporting purposes in order to establish the necessary anticipation of litigation purpose the court wrote it appears that the services argument is that regions cannot claim work product production sic protection intended if the contested documents had any use other than litigation preparation the irs has not cited nor has the court found any authority that articulates such a test indeed the court has found no support for the conclusion that a party must show that it was motivated by preparation for litigation and nothing else in order to claim that a document is protected work product document hosted at httpwwwjdsupracompostdocumentvieweraspxfidafccbfcbdefffaslip op at  emphasis in original irs’s rfc’s rfc’s the court in its financial statements audited by ey see slip op at  co  us  supported the proposition that there was no protection available to tax accrual workpaper files maintained by an outside auditor arthur specifically rejected the creation of applicable to tax accrual workpapers or other communications auditor workpapers irs’s files young auditor’s to support its audit conclusions company’s auditor’s young  court’s based “newton cannot be read to see fed r civ ‘party or its representative’” circuit’s auditor’s afforded by in rfc’s auditor’s also with regard to the ey opinion the here the district accordingly the court rounded out its analysis by taking up the irss argument that the tax opinions were created for financial reporting purposes ie to support rfcs calculation of tax reserves when those reserves came under scrutiny by its outside auditors the court accepted rfcs response and turned this argument against the irs the court said that it was because of the possibility that the irs would litigate the tax consequences of the transaction that rfc was required to establish a reserve for a contingent liability in its financial statements audited by ey see slip op at  thus anticipation of litigation necessarily precedes creation of reserves for contingent tax liabilities arthur young and accountantcreated work product in briefing the irs argued that the  supreme court decision united states v arthur young  arthur young an accountantclient privilege applicable to tax accrual workpapers or other communications the underlying question posed by the irs with the rfc summons was whether documents created by the audited company or its advisors which subsequently become part of the outside auditor files fall into the arthur young rule of nonprotection for auditor workpapers the irss contention was that arthur young removed all protections from outside auditor workpaper files this was a stretch and ultimately an overreach of the principle of arthur young an auditors workpapers are generally understood to be the documents that the auditor creates to support its audit conclusions the auditor may have other documents such as the audited companys tax opinion which are associated with the workpaper files but are not in the usual sense the auditors workpapers the district court did not discuss the supreme court decision in arthur young it analyzed an th circuit opinion united states v newton  fd   newton anticipating the supreme courts views rejected the second circuit decision in arthur young which had recognized a new accountantclient privilege based upon its analysis of newton the district judge noted that arthur young really involved a claimed new accountant client privilege and not work product protection for materials prepared by attorneys or accountants newton cannot be read to prevent the protection of trial preparation materials simply because they were created by an accountant see fed r civ pr ba extending work product to materials created by a party or its representative slip op at  thus because the supreme court in arthur young rejected the second circuits creation of a new accountantclient privilege erroneously described by the second circuit at times as accountant work product as noted by the court in newton and did not address the application of work product doctrine to thirdparty documents including documents prepared by the audit firm in an advisory capacity in connection with anticipated litigation in the auditors workpapers the court reasoned that the protection aforded by that rule could still apply to such documents in other words the tax opinions created by rfcs outside tax advisors retained work product protection even though they were provided to the outside auditor in connection with the auditors preparation of its workpapers the proper analytical question discussed below was whether such provision constituted a waiver of work product also with regard to the ey opinion the judge clearly recognized that work product protection can apply to a document produced by an accountant acting in the capacity of a tax advisor waiver the court found that rfc had not waived work product by providing its outside auditor with the contested documents during the course of the audit here the district court judge followed the trend of cases and held that outside auditors are not adversaries or conduits to adversaries accordingly supplying the documents to the accountants did not substantially increase the risk that an adversary would obtain the documents and thus there was no waiver of work product privilege moreover because ey maintained the confidentiality of its audit files and because rfc and its tax advisors agreed to confidentiality regarding the opinions there was no opportunity for the documents to be distributed outside the zone of work product protection footnotes document hosted at httpwwwjdsupracompostdocumentvieweraspxfidafccbfcbdefffa the textron case is now fully briefed on appeal to the first circuit in textron  f supp

understood that significant tax benefits could result from the transaction almost  million of sheltered income based on a favorable treatment of the dividends to the erdb  in textron the documents at issue were the spreadsheet and backup analysis prepared inhouse that supported the tax reserves the district judge in textron reasoned that there would have been no need to establish reserves and prepare such analysis were it not for the potential for litigation with the irs  the district judge chastised the irs for its erroneous formulation of this test citing a leading minority view case el paso v united states  fd  th cir the irs stated that the primary motivation test required that the document be created primarily or exclusively to assist in future litigation slip op at  n  the judge
