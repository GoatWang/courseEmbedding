karfunkel good morning and thank you all for joining our third quarter  earnings conference call since our last call we have continued to deliver strong premium growth driven by organic growth efforts and our recent acquisitions we experienced an overall combined ratio of  which was impacted by  million of losses from the louisiana floods and an additional  million of losses related to the latereported claims from the second quarter texas hail event our gross written premium for personal auto was  million up from  million in q of  driven by premium from ars which we started writing on our own paper the recently closed centurynational acquisition and  million of organic growth equating to a  organic growth rate as i have previously mentioned nonstandard auto is a business that we have had great success with by leveraging our superior it infrastructure analytics and product management capabilities and claims practices it is a line of business where many of our competitors are struggling and that presents a significant amount of organic growth and ma opportunities our homeowner business continues to do well and has gross written premium of  million up from  million in the third quarter of  driven by the recently closed centurynational acquisition and approximately  points of organic growth while still small our natgen premier product which services the highnetworth customer base continues to do well and is being well received in the marketplace as agents continue to praise our platforms ease of use our rv and commercial vehicle businesses continue to perform well and we see high growth prospects for our small fleet personaltype commercial use vehicles in our lenderplaced business we have had a nice pipeline of multiple mortgage servicers that were in discussions with and we look forward to growing our new business our accident and health business has seen good topline growth driven by the assurant acquisition which we remain extremely pleased with as well as organic growth we earned  million of operating earnings in our ah segment despite posting a significant loss in our legacy stop loss business which as we have previously mentioned are no longer writing new business through since our last call we have closed on standard mutual which brings us a nice block of standard and preferred business in illinois and indiana as well as local project expertise and agent relationships adding geographic diversification to our preferred business on tuesday of this week we closed on direct general a direct marketing nonstandard carrier in the southeastern states with direct general we add a brand that has great recognition in its markets and a highly talented staff that is analytically driven and a great culture fit that has the ability to price market sell and service nonstandard auto business through an omnichannel marketing approach with all of our acquisitions we continue to fully integrate our shared services which leverages our fixed operating expenses across the combined entity we also benefit from the unique qualities of each business which adds to the scope of our capabilities at national general in closing we continue to build a very special business that we expect to see strong results from now id like to turn the call over to mike weiner our cfo for further detail on our financial performance mike weiner thank you barry third quarter  net income was  million versus  million in the third quarter of  operating earnings were  million versus  million in last years quarter operating eps was  compared to  in the prior years quarter based on weighted average shares outstanding of  million as of september   our third quarter results were impacted by some abnormal items which id like to walk you through now first louisiana flooding in august prolonged rainfall in an area surrounding baton rouge and lafayette resulted in more than  inches of precipitation over a hour period in some areas in that flooding followed our auto rv and lenderplaced book were impacted by approximately  million pretax or  after tax roughly half those losses were in our lenderplaced book where locales affected had very low nfip participation rates development on texas hailstorms from the first and second quarter included an additional  million in costs associated with the hail event in both dallas and san antonio which increased our original estimates due to latereported claims this had a  negative impact on our eps and we have subsequently filed increases in rates on our texas property book increase in severity losses in the northeast we experienced an uptick in fire losses from our legacy monoline homeowner product which had roughly  million or  per share impact in the quarter we have looked at these  unique claims that came in during the quarter and see nothing that concerns us on a goforward basis we are also seeing strong organic growth within our auto line which resulted in our loss ratio being elevated by roughly a point finally we completed a  million preferred equity offering in july with the majority of the proceeds used to support the acquisition of direct general which closed just this week the third quarter we had not fully deployed the capital that increased our dividends which resulted in approximately  per share in the quarter now id like to give some additional detail about our two operating segments within property and casualty net written premium grew  to  million driven by  organic growth in our auto business approximately  organic growth in our home product and  million in premium from national general lender services which closed on october    million from our centurynational acquisition which closed on june   and  million from assigned risk solution which we began writing the business on our paper in the first quarter of this year within our auto product we continue to experience loss cost trends that are moderately better than the overall industry this quarter we experienced an uptick in bi frequency along with the rest of the industry we feel that we have a handle on this trend that we are seeing and we are managing the increases through ratings and claims initiatives that we have implemented over the past few quarters bi severity has been elevated over the last few quarters though we are doing better than the industry overall we attribute this to our mix of business we are looking at the relationships between rate and earnings and loss cost trends and they are currently in parity for our book service and fee income grew  to  million driven by our underlying premium growth acquisitions completed over the past quarter including centurynational and national general lender services and growth of fees earned in the attorneyinfact that managed the reciprocal exchanges the pc combined ratio was  compared to  in q  excluding amortization of intangible assets with the increase in both loss and expense ratios driven by the aforementioned items the loss ratio was  compared to  in q  with the majority of that increase driven by the louisiana flood losses latereported claims from the second quarter texas hail and higher severity losses in our monoline home book the expense ratio was  which was in line with q  within our accident and health segment net written premium grew  to  million which benefited from assurant health contributing  million of net written premium to the current year and strong growth in our domestic operations with a total of  million in net premiums written compared to  million in q  as we continue to transfer business previously written for the third quarter carriers onto our paper  thirdparty carriers onto our own paper service and fee income grew  to  million driven by the additional fee income from the assurant health acquisition and strong growth within our agencies and our hst agency the accident  health combined ratio was  versus  in q  excluding noncash amortization of intangible assets the loss ratio was  versus  in the prioryear quarter the result reflects the higher losses within our legacy small group selffunded book which we are no more  which we are offsetting by strong results in our ongoing assurant book the expense ratio was  versus  in the prioryear quarter reflecting the continued growth and maturization of our ah segment coupled with the increase in service and fee income which is a contraexpense item we continue to believe we now have the needed scale in this segment to generate meaningful returns going forward lastly with regard to hurricane matthew we expect to recognize approximately  million to  million in pretax losses from the events that occurred in the fourth quarter with the majority of the losses coming from flooding that impacted the carolinas the range of our loss is driven by a lenderplaced book which tends to have a late claim reporting cycle which differs than our traditional pc business i would now like to turn the call over to the moderator and open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and your first question is coming from randy binner sir your line is live weston bloomer hi this weston bloomer on for randy my questions on in the ah segment underwriting income was pretty good there especially with the tabs business and ah transitioning to natgen paper were losses pretty elevated there and kind of what was the main offset from the assurant book how should we think about that kind of going forward as it transitions in q  mike weiner yes youre  right in terms of so the negative that impacted us was the runoff of our legacy tab book so to remember what that business is this is a levelfunding stoploss book that we have ceased writing on so we additionally adjust and take reserves and we think the block will be running off by at the latest the first quarter of next year the assurant book was the driver of that business going forward for us so we think the earnings power of this business is going to be substantially increased as we go into next year were also just starting open enrollment which i think started this week which will be a nice driver for both our supplemental businesses as well as our levelfund and stoploss business and again we think the tabs business with this quarter is put behind us weston bloomer okay great thats helpful and then transitioning to kind of the expense ratio and acquisition ratio in the quarter i apologize if i missed this but it seemed a little elevated is that more mixrelated and do you expect that to continue going forward mike weiner well its ultimately going to stabilize out once we integrate all of our acquisitions but unfortunately itll still be up and down a little next quarter we have two things  next year excuse me  we have two things going on we have our large business thats coming in from the direct general acquisition on the auto side well have increased or elevated integration costs associated with that however to our benefit is the integration costs that weve incurred on both the assurant acquisition and the qbe acquisition are in their late stages we expect to get off of just on our largest of those acquisitions the qbe our transition services agreement which results in a notable double count in our expenses we hope to be through that by the early part of next year again what we like to think about in our business on a blended basis is that we look to run the business at a targeted loss ratio of  across all of our products and a  expense ratio were starting our planning process for  now but our early indications indicate thats really the best run rate for us going forward weston bloomer okay thanks thats very helpful ill jump back in the queue if i have any more questions congrats on the quarter operator your next question is coming from kai pan please announce your affiliation and pose your question kai pan morgan stanley good morning thank you so thank you for all the detailed explanation for the loss ratio improvement if i look at it year over year its about  points increase in loss ratio  coming from louisiana  coming from the texas hail as well as northeast storms and then you mentioned a  point from new business penalty theres probably still another point is that coming from  is there any impact from these elevated sort of loss cost trends or slightly increasing loss cost trends mike weiner yes its a great point and thats roughly what were seeing in terms of what our role forward is so as i talked about a little is that we have seen same as the industry an increase in bi frequency thats hit us through the quarter on a sequential basis just that bi frequency has increased about  points so that really makes up a big piece of the difference in terms of your walk we have taken rate weve taken it in the past and were going to continue to take it so we think about it that we believe on a goforward or a rolling month basis loss cost trends and rate taken will be in parity for us going forward and unfortunately its somewhat of a timing issue at this point right now but again were seeing the same as the industry with increased frequency notably on bi bi severity has for the industry as a whole as well as us and were looking at fasttrack data on it for the industry has been continually increasing quarter over quarter but weve taken adequate amount of rate for that okay then you see a step back from the quarter and look at the full year  the pc loss ratio around    and   this years it looks like including matthew probably going back up to  so what do you think of like going forward you just said looking around like  loss ratio does that contemplate any increase in terms of like cash activity that looks like this year we were particularly hit harder by several storms mike weiner yes so thats a great question so when we go through our planning processing and talk about that we work with our outside advisors particularly the reinsurance company to predict what is a fair cat count load that we put into our businesses so we typically have that in our number and were looking at that cat load itll go up a little but that  does include that were looking at it at a trailing year number and then on top of it is what makes it not just increase like that is that we continue to shift our business as i said were bringing on someodd million of auto business which will help push that down a little versus any increase well have in that trailing fiveyear cat impact to us kai pan okay great if i may ask about the direct general acquisition you just closed on it it is a little bit different from your agency distribution model so i just wonder from two perspectives one is that how that impacts your integration plan and how much thats worth because their combined ratio is north of  how quickly you can improve that and then secondly what kind of opportunity this affords you in terms of a brandnew platform mike weiner yes so let me answer the first two and then ill turn it over to barry in terms of what the opportunity might be so again their  youre correct in terms of their combined ratio when we acquired the business it was running  we feel very strongly that its coming on profitable just when you do some very lowhanging fruit like redoing the reinsurance structure and general management tasks like that what our goal is that over the first  months of that acquisition we will take the business from a highs combined ratio to get that to our  to  target ratio for our monoline auto segment i can tell you just being out there this week and talking to the folks and all of these things we have in place we really feel good about that business going forward barry barry karfunkel as far as going forward and the opportunity with direct general its a great business our businesses really complement each other were huge opportunities to be able to leverage direct generals as well as national generals respective product strengths where theyve got presence in states where we currently arent in vice versa weve got product strengths visÃ vis our products strengths theyre really underpenetrated in from a marketing and storefront basis we target different slices of the nonstandard market opportunity to be able to crosssell different products through the storefront so whether its ah etc so going forward we see tremendous amounts of opportunity in this business kai pan great thanks lastly if i may just quick number question whats that  million impairment related to on the investment side mike weiner yes so we took some otti impairments on some positions that we have primarily some of these positions where on utilities and on some overseas shipping businesses that we had a position in these were fixedincome instruments so looking at our otti policy we needed to impair them at this time kai pan okay great well thanks so much for all the answers operator your next question is coming from meyer shields please announce your affiliation and pose your question meyer shields great kbw and thanks so much so mike you talked about how rate increases are basically keeping pace with loss cost inflation given the fact that a lot of competitors are struggling wouldnt there be an opportunity for margin expansion or how are you thinking about that mike weiner well we are seeing because  ill answer it a little differently  we are seeing that our organic growth is certainly higher and our monoline vehicle business higher than we target ive always talked about our targeting a growth in that business in the low to mid     and were getting a number double of that simply because we have again in the auto side we have a lot of small regional competitors that are just really struggling right now with our sophisticated pricing and our expense efficiencies were continuing to gain share with that so what were going to do at this point right now is that let that business come to us we will continue to defend our core ratio to get to our  to  i think if we do that in the segment that we operate under with some of the pressures on those other competitors well still be able to get the higher than anticipated normal market growth as i talked about of that  to  meyer shields okay thats helpful and if i can go back to the cat provision is there any way of quantifying not the dollar impact of these storms but the difference between what you would expect and what youre seeing in terms of cats and weather mike weiner yes well in terms of what the projections were and where it actually came in meyer shields or in terms of the provisions within pricing mike weiner the provision versus the pricing im trying to think about this now it is certainly notionably higher than what we had anticipated for the quarter however it is much lower than our retention that we have in the business so just on the property side i dont know if im answering this the way you wanted to but on the property side on some of our properties we have about a  or  cat load and weve been just hit for the last three quarters with these many cat events that are hitting us and  million here  million here and obviously a much larger number is coming in the fourth quarter meyer shields no thats exactly what i was looking for and then one last question if direct generals i dont know hurricane matthew losses end up higher than their preclose estimate who bears that risk mike weiner well we do an opening balance sheet adjustment when i gave you that  first of all when i gave you that estimate between the  and  that does include it we have got constant reports from them throughout the close on every one of those but thatll ultimately go on the closing balance sheet but again weve looked at it their losses are de minimus they dont have the same concentration risk that we had in north carolina so its really a nonevent for us in terms of that again the vast majority of what has hit us with hurricane matthew about twothirds of its going to be coming through our lenderplaced business meyer shields okay and thats property rather than auto mike weiner thats correct meyer shields okay thanks so much operator and your last question is coming from matt carletti please announce your affiliation and pose your question matt carletti hi its matt carletti with jmp good morning just a couple of questions just following up on the matthew estimate of losses i just want to make sure that im understanding this right in the lpi book am i right that the policy there does cover flood where a more traditional homeowners policy might not or usually doesnt mike weiner yes so a very good question so if the current property right has  is in a flood area and has an nfip policy right those numbers on those policies are escrowed and paid and we dont actually pay for that right matt carletti okay mike weiner however a large amount of the impact that were estimating were not in required flood areas where an nfip put policy there and ourselves and the industry as a whole in lenderplaced does cover that the variability around the losses in that business the reason we have such a wide range is unlike a traditional home product when theres somebody living in the home or whatnot and in some cases these are as well  theres a lot of vacant properties  it takes a much longer reporting cycle to get there so and on average it takes about  or someodd days to get a report in and on vacant properties many of the lenders will go out and hire thirdparty tpas to inspect it so thats  that process is happening as we speak matt carletti got you okay that makes sense a couple of other questions just on the ah business the stop loss books obviously the new assurant book and youre running off the old kind of natgen book where are we in that runoff process it feels like we should be getting to the end of it but just is next quarter the end or do we have more to go mike weiner no listen we reserved that book we think its all behind us at this point right now matt carletti okay great perfect and then last question just northeast losses like youre mentioning  individual claims and you looked at them and didnt really see any kind of common themes or at least anything to worry about were there any common themes in terms of the causes of what was driving the losses or some sort of characteristics about them or did they really just looked for lack of a better word just very random to you mike weiner they looked very random to the extent we actually pulled each one of the losses the management team these were some fires that happened some floods an electrical event two or three of them were fires that jumped from one home or one building to the others which is then a subrogation opportunity to do one was a highvalued home that had a broken pipe and flooded just very random there was really no trend there its not like we had ice damming in the roofs or something like that or fraud or anything like that we spent a lot of time analyzing it thats why we feel so comfortable that it is just a unique string of bad luck we had in the northeast on this matt carletti all right that color is really helpful congrats on the quarter and best of luck operator we do have another question coming from kai pan please announce your affiliation and pose your question kai pan again morgan stanley thank you for taking the followup just bigger picture you mentioned in your opening remark about potential acquisition opportunities i just wonder one is that which are you are looking at like in terms of business line or geographic areas youre looking at and then secondly how do you balance management resources between looking out for acquisitions as well as at the same time you are integrating these large acquisitions done in the recent period mike weiner yes so two very good questions many of the acquisitions that we target or we monitor and we have a portfolio on really are unique situations that come to us the ones were looking at right now are disproportionately probably weighted to auto at this point right now and particularly nonstandard monoline auto the key for us is to not bite off more than we can chew right and thats what is the most fundamental thing that we  what we focus on every day every one of the acquisitions we do has a very detailed integration process that goes through both from a technology a human resource side and whatnot and as ive always said from beginning to end it takes approximately  months so were aggressively starting we had a little bit of a head start on some of the direct general stuff so what we try to do is be able to overlay any acquisition to where we are right now in terms of our resource allocations to be very very cognizant of that and quite frankly if we cant integrate it and get the return and get it to what we want to do over a very short period of time  to  months then we wont do it barry karfunkel just to add to that our operations team has a very regimented plan on integrating these acquisitions and we start preparing for it on our side as soon as  at signing of the deal so thats on the national general side by the time the deal has closed weve made very significant progress and that really enables  that regimented plan really enables us to take a very strong approach and integrate these acquisitions while really leveraging the many strengths that we bring to bear kai pan great thanks again operator thank you ladies and gentlemen

wwwnationalgeneralcom with that i present our ceo mr barry karfunkel barry karfunkel good morning and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter  earnings conference call well our first quarter earnings results were lower than we would like to see primarily due to cash activity on our auto and lenderplaced insurance lines of business iâm extremely excited about how weâve position national general for the future the personal auto insurance sector as a whole is facing pressure and by leveraging our superior technology claims and pricing capabilities weâre seeing a high organic growth rates both this quarter and for the year as a result of our direct general acquisition we now have the ability to market nonstandard auto directly to the consumer while the nationwide renewal rates transaction opens up the new marketing channel where national general will be the first nonstandard option for their exclusive agents iâm pleased to report that was completed the migration of direct generalâs claims on to our platform eliminating a significant expense and more importantly enabling us to have to required claims controls in place which drive our underwriting performance with respect to our nationwide renewal rates transaction we begin to receive their internet leads in the first quarter weâre encouraged by the level of engagement of their exclusive and independent agents thus far and expect to see more meaningful topline benefit later in the year as we complete the quote automation process between our respective platforms which will enhance that ease of use for their agents to quote our products our commercial vehicle book of business continues to do extremely well weâve added to our book of business with the centurynational transaction and we expect to get some added commercial vehicle protection as a result of the nationwide transaction while the commercial vehicle industry as a whole as struggle to maintain profitability our commercial vehicle business is primarily focused on the personal use type vehicles we were able to leverage our expertise from personal vehicle and it continues to perform very well weâve had made significant progress in our homeowners business over the past year with growth coming from new partnerships as well as expanding our product offerings including our premier line which serves as the high net worth market in  we diversified our book of business which has historically been highly concentrated in the northeast as a result of our centurynational and standard mutual acquisitions we now have an established presence on the west coast and in the midwest we believe we currently have a solid state footprint to support strong growth into the future our lenderplaced business declined through the loss of in auto collateral protection client we maintain relationship with that client and our full tracking this year auto loans however they made a corporate decision to stop placing lenderplaced insurance on their auto loans in recent months weâve signed on few new accounts and indiscernible prospect that we expect to convert on in the future turning to our ah segment we posted a wonderful q which is indicative of future earnings potential to acquire to insurance lines of business proceed great results and our agencies have experienced solid top line growth turning to our outlook for  we looked further enhancing our position within our respective markets we look forward to emerging our legacy nonstandard auto data with direct general on a single database which will enhanced our product offerings and enable us to enter certain states that perform very well for direct general through the independent agency channel with our homeownersâ product we look forward to continued growth and will be doing a fair amount of work to upgrade our product specification while making progress on integrating the centurynational and standard mutual platforms with our lenderplaced lines of business weâll be investing in making our tracking platform more client centric which will also reduce our expenses going forward for  our margins for this book of business should be below target while we work to enhance our platform and our topline for accident and health weâre completely of insurance platform and we will be investing and upgrading our platform to ensure that it is bestinclass our agencyâs margins remain pressured in this environment of low commission rates in the accident and health segment nonetheless they contribute the solid amounts of underwriting income for our carriers we also see the potential opportunity to leverage our direct general distribution to increased accident and health revenue in the future lastly with our acquisition of quotit a leading individual health insurance comparative rater we see the opportunity to leverage that in some platform that could be a basis for strong independent agency technology offerings and provide us with strong software as a service licensing fee revenue in terms of acquisitions as of now i donât proceed us having acquisitive year that weâve had in  rather we see a lot of opportunity for smaller tuckin acquisitions which have the potential to significantly enhance our existing business in closing  was the year of transformative growth for national general weâve had a fantastic top line results and position to accident and health for wonderful future results while adding new capabilities with our acquisitions which will play a significant role in our future growth iâve never been more excited about the future of national general than iâm today with that iâd like to turn the call over to mike weiner our cfo for further detail on our financial performance mike weiner thank you barry fourth quarter  net income was  million versus  million in the fourth quarter of  operating earnings were  million versus  million in last yearâs quarter operating eps was  compared to  in the prior yearâs quarter based on weighted average shares outstanding of  million as of december   our fourth quarter results were impacted by some unusual items which iâd like to walk you through firstly hurricane matthew weâve experienced  million in losses associated with hurricane matthew which struck the southeastern close to united states in october of  this fell below our previous announced expected range as losses from our lenderplaced book where below our initial indications the majority of the losses emanated from our order book which was impacted by the flooding that took place in north carolina development on the louisiana flooding we recorded an additional  million in losses related to the flooding in louisiana that occurred in august  a  million impact due to the runoff of that lenderplaced auto clients barry mentioned we continue to see very strong organic growth within our auto line which has resulted in a loss ratio being elevated by roughly one point in a new business now iâd like to give you some additional detail on our two operating segments firstly within property and casualty net written premium grew  to  million driven by  of organic growth  million from the direct general acquisition  million from the centurynational acquisition  million from standard mutual and  million from the assigned risk solutions which we began right in the business on our own paper in the first quarter of this year we reported  million in net written premium from our lender services product down from  million in the fourth quarter of  with the majority of that decline related to the previous mentioned auto client the top line impact in this quarter was artificially high as the product is high cancellation rates and includes the refund of premiums from previous quarters moving forward we will continue to provide loan tracking services for that client as barry mentioned in his remarks we have recently signed a few lenderplaced clients which should have a positive impact on the top line results in the near future service and fee income grew  to  million driven by underlying premium growth acquisitions completed in the past year particularly direct general and the growth of fees earned by the attorneyinfact that managed the reciprocal exchanges the property and casualty combined ratio was  compared to  in q  excluding amortization of intangibles assets with the increase in both the loss ratio and expense ratio driven by the aforementioned items the loss ratio was  compared to  in q  with the majority of that increase was driven by catastrophic losses from both hurricane matthew in the fourth quarter as well as the operating adjustment and losses from the louisiana flood that occurred in the third quarter the expense ratio was  compared to  in q  with the uptick driven by less lenderplaced product to spread the fixed expense base over as well as increased incorporate and integration expenses within accident and health segment net written premium grew  to  million which benefited from strong growth in our domestic operations with a total of  million in net premiums written compared to  million in q  as we continue to transfer business previously written on thirdparty carriers onto our own paper service and fee income declined  million to  million in the fourth quarter of  primarily driven by a shift in products written during the quarter in response to changes in shortterm medical regulations which will earn in on a deferred basis throughout the year  accident and health combined ratio was  versus  in q  excluding cash amortization of intangible assets the loss ratio was  versus  in the prior yearâs quarter the results reflect a more normalized level of the small group selffunded product and strong results from our supplemental products and our european accident books the expense ratio was  versus  in the prior yearâs quarter partially driven by lower fee income in the quarter which is a contraexpense item in our earnings release we disclosed that we expect to file a form b with the sec on or before march  which states that we will be unable to file our k in a timely manner we are delayed in our filing due to more time needed to complete our yearend audit we do not anticipate any changes from the previously reported results and expect our k to be filed on or before march  i would now like to turn the call over to the moderator and open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is coming from matt carletti jmp securities sir please announce your affiliation your line is live matt carletti hi thank you iâm matt carletti with jmp good morning barry karfunkel good morning matt carletti couple of questions first one just talking about the health side of the business your potential impacts or potential changes coming through aca i know that we donât know what those are going to be but i just curious if could give us a little color on how you are thinking about how your business is situated for kind of some of the changes that are at least being discussed barry karfunkel on the carrier side of things we should be pretty unchanged donât first see a lot of impact itâs more on the agency side of things weâre again depending on what kind of change happens exactly with affordable care act if we were to enter into an environment where the minimum loss ratios from selling major medical were to go way or be decreased then that would ultimately provide more room for commission payments and allow commission payments to go back somewhat to what they were historically before the affordable care act that should potentially be able to provide a boost otherwise donât foresee a significant impact mike weiner yes i would add to that we wiped â it out every possible alternative that we can think about now using everything thatâs out there in the market unfortunately itâs says everyone knows a little gray and weâre following things very very closely i think the key thing that i alluded to earlier was that we have acquired through these years and the acquisitions and whatnot a phenomenal distribution force and that distribution force for whatever product becomes available that we think will be able to utilize that quite substantially and then be in a situation to sell on to the top of that those supplemental products so i think weâre well positioned to pay that â to no matter what happens going forward which is a good place to be matt carletti great and then one other question just shifting businesses â and your up market homeowners product i mean you guys were iâd say an early mover there in the sense that when thereâs a lot of consolidation took place a couple of years ago you guys really kind of put your foot on the gas building that business more recently at least on the outside office is analysts and investors have heard some of your peer companies talk about trying to push into that market iâm just curious what if anything have you seen for â that happening from a competitive standpoint i recognize you guys are only in certain geographies which over there so maybe youâre not seeing them but i just be curious kind of how the competition is sits now itâs changed from where you stand mike weiner yes weâve heard the same things as well but we continue to go to market and we continue to look at the other companies that are being quoted against and those new competitors just turn out there yet so itâs the same competitors that we all heard of they were there quite frankly prior to us i think the key for us in this space and thatâs been something that barry and myself have been very pleasantly surprised with is that or while we think weâve a phenomenal product as we know we have phenomenal product and we focused on that mass outflow in space as opposed to the high high value itâs really what our technologies being allowing us to do in terms of â excuse me a real time quoting and binding and working with the agents thatâs really propelled growth that weâve add in there still small in the business but the growth rate has been phenomenal with us and as we have weâre bringing on additional states and we have both east coast and west coast marketing teams out there so we still feel very bullish about that and getting back to original question we havenât really seen those competitors yet potentially later in the year where they might be out there matt carletti okay great thank you very much for answers congrats on a nice year and best of luck in  mike weiner thank you barry karfunkel thank you operator your next question is coming from randy binner please announce your affiliation your line is live randy binner hi randy binner with fbr and iâve had a little bit of connection issues earlier on the call so could you just repeat what the nature of the decline loss was in lenderplaced and maybe provide a little bit more color on did the new accounts that youâve been able to write there mike weiner sure let me talk about the first one this was obviously a lenderplaced business the vast majority of the business it is placing a lenderplaced property business would you owe a cpi business that focuses on working with both small and very large banks in terms of placing auto on a lenderplaced side one particular client of ours has decided to continue to track the business but has decided to stop lender placing the business which is not regulatorily required as in you have in the mortgage business which are required to maintain any chance to different regulatory scheme on that so whatâs happens to us financially on that is that we donât have the new business that goes forward and remember how these businesses work is in many cases your lender placing the business and you have cancellations that come up so those cancellations are moving through now as well as some fixed costs that we had in the quarter to finish up that book of business so thatâs a smaller piece of the business actually the lowest of all the margins of the businesses that we operate under but the good news in part of the businesses as far as integration continues to go well in terms of what weâre doing and investing in it weâre now at the point and itâs taken us longer so than we anticipated to winning some new accounts we have actually signed some new accounts in the current quarter and are working on rfps quite aggressively on some additional accounts that will come in later in the year the problem is is that thereâs a long leave time even from the clients that weâve signed in the quarter until we have meaningful premium earnings on that in addition to it as barry alluded to in his original comments weâre investing in our stateoftheart platform in that space to be a key competitor out there in the industry if not become at one point in the industry later randy binner and just to clarify that so that client â these are â did you say it was automobiles â mike weiner thatâs correct randy binner so they want to track on but others does this like take the collateral risk themselves basically is it right mike weiner thatâs correct you got it randy binner okay okay thatâs fine so they didnât put it to your competitor mike weiner absolutely not randy binner yes okay thatâs good and then in commercial auto i guess iâd kind of like to dig into this a little more why you all â i think your commercial auto books is different than what we see generically in the market in part because you focus on ours and contractors and other vehicles that donât move around the same way like a longhaul truck would and so is that kind of the key difference and why you havenât had issues there like the rest of the industry mike weiner yes randy binner any commentary on why you assumed you may be having a different result than a lot of the big riders that would be helpful mike weiner yes because itâs â weâre using the word commercial auto and perhaps may be we shouldnât may be we should think of creating something new but the vast majority of the book is these audition vehicles so weâre not doing longhaul trucking weâre not doing shorthaul trucking weâre not doing box trucking right the vast majority of the business are individual entrepreneurs plumbing â plumbers and roofers and that type of thing itâs just a different business than weâve seen in addition to it is we had a relatively small very well underwritten book so we bought this business back in  we acquired a book and we spent probably close to two to three years manually underwriting every risk there in developing a phenomenal underwriting team and weâve grown that organically and maybe through some acquisitions like on the nationwide thing which will start showing some sign of it but again itâs an audition small commercial book which is just different barry karfunkel and weâre really able to leverage our auto insurance â private passenger auto insurance data itâs really be able to price that book more effective lease and larger commercial riders that are not necessarily heavy for expertise and pricing auto mike weiner yes and weâre also using the segmentation in all of our auto underwriting tools that weâre doing on now which is really applying that to it thatâs why itâs much more came to our auto business than to the market commercial auto randy binner all right that makes sense letâs jump into just cover more items there indiscernible and i think it seems like a onetime some â onetime issue maybe there where you paid out some incentive fees can you just elaborate on that kind of what that was and what the size of the impact was mike weiner yes i donât think it was that material it was really just we have some performancerelated fees that we paid it out â we paid out in the current quarter so we expect that to get back to a normal run going forward randy binner well how much did you payout though mike weiner i donât have the number off the top of my head it wasnât that material randy binner okay and then finally on the â yes i guess on just the k delay i guess i take it from your comments that this is its like a volume of work problem was all the ma that closed in the back half of last yearâs is that kind of a fair way to characterize what the delay is mike weiner yes absolutely we just have a lot of work and a lot of volume itâs not one thing in specific that weâre dealing with here so we just need more time to work with our auditors through the auto process and we donât expect any changes with the reported results and thereâs also some new disclosures out there that insurance companies are dealing with that have slowed down the process a bit randy binner all right thanks a lot operator and your last question is coming from meyer shields sir your line is live meyer shields good morning can you hear me mike weiner yes meyer shields okay sorry iâm having some phone trouble mike can you elaborate a little more on sort of like the basic personal auto pressure that most of the industry has seen in terms of frequency and severity in terms of what you guys are mike weiner yes absolutely weâre a little unique versus others in that what weâve really seen is weâve seen an increase as â same really story as i told last quarter but it hasnât really subsided weâve seen an increase in bi severity which has really impacted our book frequency so weâve seen an increase in bi frequency which is kind of unique to versus others weâve taken on a lot of iâd like to call it early claims in the programs that allow us to settle these things earlier but weâre seeing some continuing increases in bi frequency thatâs continued but the trend is in line again what we saw in the prior quarter and we continue to grade that as equal to it as we move forward meyer shields okay thatâs helpful and barry youâve gave some i guess optimistic expectations for accident  health were you using the fourth quarter results or the full year  as that base barry karfunkel fourth quarter results meyer shields wow okay fantastic thanks much barry karfunkel sure operator and you have no more questions in queue christine worley great thank you all for joining us and we look forward to
