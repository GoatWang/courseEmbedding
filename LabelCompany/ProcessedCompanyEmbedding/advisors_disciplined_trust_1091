reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period  the trust is considered to be concentrated in securities issued by companies in the health care sector negative developments in this sector will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment  the trusts performance might not

notice distributions monthly distributions your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income along with any excess capital on each monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least  of the trusts net asset value as determined under the trust agreement the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change the issuers in the trusts portfolio make dividend payments at various times during the year when the trust receives dividends from issuers the trustee credits the dividends to the trusts accounts because the trust does not necessarily receive dividends from the underlying issuers at a constant rate throughout the year the trusts income distributions to unitholders will fluctuate from month to month estimated annual distributions the estimated net annual distributions are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus we generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer or adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or on scheduled income payments however dividend conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividends paid or declared over several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions due to this and various other factors actual income payments received by the trust will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments the actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in income payments received and with the sale of securities the estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs the creation and development fee and the deferred sales fee reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and

investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time strategy correlation risk is the risk that the trusts performance will not sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the trusts investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as  the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact weightings at a given time  strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while trusts may be created at various times during the year and generally have  month terms  the trust may not be fully invested at all times and  trust fees and expenses concentration risk is the risk that the value of your trust is more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry a portfolio concentrates in an industry when stocks in a particular industry make up  or more of the portfolio the trust invests primarily in stocks of health care companies companies in the health care industry are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic in addition healthcare facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any security no fdic guarantee an investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency hypothetical performance information the following table compares hypothetical performance information for the strategy employed by the trust and the actual performance of the djiasm in each of the years listed below and as of the most recent month these hypothetical returns should not be used to predict future performance of the trust returns from the trust will differ from the hypothetical strategy returns for several reasons such as  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur  strategy returns are for calendar years and through the most recent month while trusts begin and end on various dates  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in all stocks comprising its strategy and  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the closing prices used in buying and selling units you should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any index and it is not expected that it will do so in fact the trusts strategy underperformed its comparative index in certain years and we

concession a compensation brokerdealer firms will not receive additional compensation unless they sell at least  million of units of volume concession a trusts during a calendar quarter for example if a firm sells  million of units of volume concession a trusts in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter the firm will not receive any additional compensation with respect to such trusts once a firm reaches a particular breakpoint during a quarter the firm will receive the stated volume concession on all initial offering period sales of volume concession a trusts during the applicable quarter for example if a firm sells  million of units of volume concession a trusts in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter the firm will receive additional compensation of  of  million and if a firm sells  million of units of volume concession a trusts in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter the firm will receive additional compensation of  of  million in addition dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge however such sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints for volume concessions secondary market sales of all unit trusts are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions we will pay these amounts out of our own assets within a reasonable time following each calendar quarter any sales fee discount is borne by the brokerdealer or selling firm out of the distribution fee we reserve the right to change the amount of concessions or agency commissions from time to time we currently provide at our own expense and out of our own profits additional compensation and benefits to brokerdealers who sell units of this trust and our other products this compensation is intended to result in additional sales of our products andor compensate brokerdealers and financial advisors for past sales a number of factors are considered in determining whether to pay these additional amounts such factors may include but are not limited to the level or type of services provided by the intermediary the level or expected level of sales of our products by the intermediary or its agents the placing of our products on a preferred or recommended product list and access to an intermediarys personnel we may make these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediarys representations or offices obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of our products we make such payments to a substantial majority of intermediaries that sell our products we may also make certain payments to or on behalf of intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating unit sales such as the costs of developing or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades payments of such additional compensation described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described above some of which may be characterized as revenue sharing may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our products including this trust over other products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units we generally register units for sale in various states in the us we do not register units for  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th sale in any foreign country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully we may reject any order for units in whole or in part we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to

securities to create units the amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities into the trust is shown in the notes to portfolio taxes this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust the trust is expected to hold shares of stock in corporations the stocks that are treated as equity for federal income tax purposes it is possible that the trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg dividends and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a new  percent medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax understanding your investment  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of certain dividends that exceed a corporations accumulated earnings and profits as discussed below if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  for net capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years and the  rate is reduced to  for net capital gains from most property regardless of when acquired with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations dividends from stocks certain dividends received with respect to the stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied these special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   dividends received deduction generally a domestic corporation owning units in a trust may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to such unit owners pro rata portion of certain types of dividends received by the trust however a corporation generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends from most foreign corporations inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units or at your trusts termination by electing to receive an in kind distribution you will receive trust assets plus possibly cash you will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole trust assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same trust assets held by your trust  understanding your investment pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd however if you also receive cash in exchange for a trust asset or a fractional portion of a trust asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such trust asset or fractional portion rollovers and exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trust for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical trust assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income foreign investors taxes and investments distributions by your trust that are

with respect to other us tax withholding and reporting requirements some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes any income withheld will still be treated as income to

deduction for those foreign taxes if any us investor is treated as owning directly or indirectly  percent or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation and all us shareholders of that corporation collectively own more than  percent of the vote or value of the stock of that corporation the foreign corporation may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation

trusts created under the name advisors disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the securities in such trust thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each security if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees the trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the trust portfolio each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide total return through dividend income and capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio consisting of the  stocks with the highest dividend yield chosen from among the  stocks in the dow jones industrial averagesm djiasm as of the trusts selection date there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the prospectus provides additional information regarding the trusts objective and investment strategy the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in special circumstances as provided in the trust agreement thus the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged under normal circumstances the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited exceptions the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or other transaction if offered such new or exchanged securities or property other than cash trustee shall generally reject the offer however in the event such securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust they may be accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in a trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor the trustee may sell securities designated by the supervisor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust the replacement securities must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed securities the replacement securities must be equity securities of the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust of the failed security exceeded the cost of the replacement security once all of the securities in a trust are acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the cash attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such cash they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust in the event that a replacement security is not acquired by a trust the income for such trust may be reduced to the best of the sponsors knowledge there is no litigation pending as of the trusts inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust at any time after the trusts inception litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with respect to the securities the sponsor is unable to predict whether any such litigation may be instituted or if instituted whether such litigation might have a material adverse effect on the trust the sponsor and the trustee shall not be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security risk factors market risk because the trust invests in stocks you should understand the risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st of the stocks and therefore units will fall stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time because the trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because some trusts hold a relatively small number of stocks you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment dividends stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock health care issuers the trust may invest significantly in health care companies healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotech managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the healthcare field these companies are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic in addition healthcare facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in congress from time to time these proposals span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of healthcare services tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans the sponsor is unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals if enacted on the issuers of securities in your trust additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units in connection with these deposits existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and other acquisition costs administration of the trust distributions to unitholders income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account for the trust all other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate capital account for the trust the trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata share of the available balance of the income account of the trust all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the trustee is not required to make a distribution from the income account or the capital account unless the total cash held for distribution equals at least  of the trusts net asset value as determined under the trust agreement proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account the trustee shall be required to make a distribution from the capital account if the cash balance on deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least  per unit the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income

date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to the unitholders pro rata share of the available balance of the income account of the trust after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner a person will become the owner of units and thereby a unitholder of record on the date  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd of settlement provided payment has been received notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser but in the normal course of business the selling brokerdealer provides such notice the trustee will periodically deduct from the income account of a trust and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from
