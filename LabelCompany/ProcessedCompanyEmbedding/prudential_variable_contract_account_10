variable annuity is suitable for you why the company behind the annuity matters all references to income certainty and guarantees including the benefit payment obligations arising under the annuity contract guarantees rider guarantees benefits or annuity payout rates are backed by the claimspaying ability of the issuing insurance company those payments and the responsibility to make them are not the obligations of the third party brokerdealer from which this annuity is purchased or any of its affiliates they are also not obligations of any affiliates of the issuing insurance company all guarantees including benefits do not apply to the underlying investment options what are the limitations and restrictions i need to consider annuity contracts contain exclusions limitations reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force the optional benefits have certain investment holding period liquidity and withdrawal limitations and restrictions optional living and death benefits may not be available in every state and may not be elected in conjunction with certain optional benefits please see the prospectus or ask your advisor for more information asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investors units when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original investment diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market prudential annuities is not providing investment advice selections are dependent on the risk tolerance and investment goals of the customer for the prudential premier investment variable annuity the optional return of purchase payments death benefit may not be available in every state and has certain investment restrictions fees charged for the death benefit are in addition to fees and charges associated with the basic annuity please see the prospectus for more information issued on riders pridrop pridropny et al or any state variation thereof prudential annuities and its distributors and representatives do not provide tax accounting or legal advice please consult your own attorney or accountant what are the withdrawal consequences since the annuity is designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for retirement there are limitations and restrictions when making withdrawals that are not intended for retirement income purposes for the highest daily lifetime income benefit and the prudential defined income va withdrawals in excess of the income amount impact the value of a product or benefit an excess withdrawal occurs when your cumulative lifetime withdrawals exceed the income amount in any annuity year if an excess withdrawal is taken only the portion of the lifetime withdrawal that exceeds the remaining income amount for that year will proportionally and permanently reduce future guaranteed amounts if a withdrawal reduces the account value to zero no further amount would be payable and the contract terminates withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made prior to age ½ may be subject to an additional  federal income tax penalty sometimes referred to as an additional income tax withdrawals other than from iras or employer retirement plans are deemed to be gains out first for tax purposes withdrawals reduce the account value death benefits and the annual amount of living andor death benefits available what are the costs associated with the highest daily lifetime income benefit and the variable annuity variable annuities offered by prudential companies have an annual cost of  to  for mortality expense and administration fees with an additional fee related to the professional investment options the fees will vary depending on the underlying annuity and investment options selected the optional benefit hd lifetime income has an additional annual fee of  based on the greater of two amounts the account value or protected withdrawal value the protected withdrawal value is only used to calculate the guaranteed lifetime income and the charge for the benefit it is separate from the account value and not available as a lump sum withdrawal account value is not guaranteed is subject to market fluctuations and may lose value what happens to my account value during volatile market situations the highest daily lifetime income v suite of benefits uses a predetermined mathematical formula to help us mitigate some of the financial risks we incur in providing the guarantees under this benefit through all market cycles each business day the formula determines if any portion of your account value in the permitted subaccounts asset allocation portfolios including any dollar cost averaging market value adjusted options needs to be automatically transferred into or out of the ast investment grade bond portfolio the bond portfolio amounts transferred by the formula depend on a number of factors unique to your individual annuity and include      the difference between the account value and the protected withdrawal value      how long you have owned the benefit      the amount invested in and the performance of the permitted subaccounts the bond portfolio and the secure value account sva and      the impact of additional purchase payments made to and withdrawals taken from the annuity the formula will not transfer amounts to or from the secure value account sva on any given day no more than  of the account value in the permitted subaccounts plus any dca mva options may be transferred to the bond portfolio pursuant to the formula therefore at any given time some most or none of the account value may be allocated to the bond portfolio transfers to and from the bond portfolio do not impact any income guarantees that have already been locked in you may not allocate purchase payments or transfer account value into or out of the bond portfolio the formula could mean that you miss opportunities for investment gains in the permitted subaccounts while amounts are allocated to the bond portfolio the formulas allocation of amounts to the bond portfolio however could also protect your account value from losses that may occur in the permitted subaccounts please note we are not providing investment advice through the formula see the prospectus for complete details we will automatically allocate  of each purchase payment to the sva you cannot make transfers into or out of the sva the sva will earn interest daily at a crediting rate declared annually what do i need to consider when investing in a va with the highest daily lifetime income benefit asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s units when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original investment the value or price of a particular stock or other equity or equityrelated security owned by a portfolio could go down and you could lose money fixed income investments are subject to risk including credit and interest rate risk because of these risks a subaccount’s share value may fluctuate if interest rates rise bond prices usually decline if interest rates decline bond prices usually increase diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market certain portfolios may use leverage short sales and derivatives or engage in other speculative practices within their alternative investments these practices include a high degree of risk and may increase the risk size and velocity of investment losses although certain alternative strategies seek to reduce risk by attempting to reduce correlation with equity and bond markets no guarantee can be given that such efforts will be successful the fees and expenses associated with alternative investments are generally higher than those for traditional investments issued on riders pridhd pridhdhdb  et al or state variation thereof what are the costs associated with the prudential defined income variable annuity the annual fee for the prudential defined income va is  plus an additional benefit fee of  for a total annual product charge of  we reserve the right to increase the benefit fee up to a maximum of  at any time on or after the th annuity anniversary on existing contracts this would increase the total annual product charge to a maximum of  note there is also an additional fee for the ast multisector fixed income portfolio please see the prospectus for additional information what do i need to consider when investing in the prudential defined income va fixed income investments are subject to risk including credit and interest rate risk because of these risks a subaccounts share value may fluctuate if interest rates rise bond prices usually decline if interest rates decline bond prices usually increase an investment in an exchangetraded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity or debt securities traded on exchange in the relevant securities market the investment return and principal value of etf investments will fluctuate over time etfs that offer leverage or that are designed to perform inversely to the index or benchmark they track or both are highly complex financial instruments that are typically designed to achieve their objectives on a daily basis due to the effects of compounding their performance over longer periods of time can differ significantly from the performance or inverse of the performance of the underlying index or benchmark issued on contracts pbbnd pridlidb  et al or state variation thereof what do i need to understand about the prudential premier investment asset allocation portfolios the prudential premier® investment variable annuity offers certain subaccounts that invest in underlying portfolios which are also available in other variable annuity contracts we offer those other variable annuity contracts offer certain optional living benefits that utilize a predetermined mathematical formula the “formula” to manage the guarantees offered in connection with those optional benefits you should be aware that the operation of the formula in those other variable annuity contracts may result in largescale asset flows into and out of the underlying portfolios through a series of transfers in addition to increasing the portfolios expenses the asset flows may adversely affect performance by i requiring the portfolios to purchase or sell securities at inopportune times ii otherwise limiting the subadvisers ability to fully implement the portfolios investment strategies or iii requiring the portfolios to hold a larger portion of their assets in highly liquid securities that they otherwise would hold before you allocate to these subaccounts you should consider the impact the formula will have on each portfolios risk profile expenses and performance please see the prospectus for more information and work with your financial professional to determine which portfolios are appropriate for you what are the costs associated with the prudential premier investment variable annuity variable annuities offered by prudential financial companies are available at a total annual insurance cost of  to  with additional fees related to the professionally managed investment options note all products may not be available through all third party brokerdealers return of purchase payments death benefit is available for an additional annual fee of  please see the prospectus for additional information both the total insurance charge and the optional death benefit charge are comprised of an account valuebased charge and a premiumbased charge account valuebased charges are assessed daily based on an annualized rate charged against the assets allocated to the subaccounts premiumbased charges are assessed quarterly against the charge basis please see the section of the prospectus called fees charges and deductions for information on the charge basis and are taken prorata from the subaccounts while most traditional vas assess insurance charges daily based on account value the insurance charge for the premier investment va is assessed partially on account value and partially on cumulative purchase payments adjusted for withdrawals when we refer to the “progrowth” charge structure we are illustrating that when compared to most traditional vas any growth in your client’s account value will result in an overall insurance charge that represents a smaller percentage of account value a lower “effective charge” this is because the portion of the charge based on cumulative purchase payments remains constant conversely if your client’s account value were to decline below cumulative purchase payments adjusted for withdrawals this would result in a higher effective charge what do i need to consider when investing in the prudential premier investment va if you purchase the prudential premier® investment variable annuity within a taxadvantaged retirement plan such as an ira sepira roth ira a plan or nonerisa b plan you will get no additional tax advantage through the annuity itself because there is no additional tax advantage when a variable annuity is purchased through one of these plans the reasons for purchasing the annuity inside a qualified plan are limited to the ability to elect the return of purchase payments death benefit the opportunity to annuitize the contract and the various investment options which might make the annuity an appropriate investment for you you should consult your
