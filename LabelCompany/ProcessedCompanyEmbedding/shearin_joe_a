previous new yorkbased immigration attorney we started looking for another one with experience in the immigration sector we scheduled a meeting with dallas immigration lawyer mr martin valko of chavez  valko and asked him what he thought about our casein april  we received our l a visa l for the family to establish a new office of our german software company in the us unfortunately we were not able to leave germany before october  in december  we asked our prior attorney to apply for the extension of the visa he filed the application for the extension of the la visa in april 0  months later instead of answering the ins request for evidence rfe he tried to change the visa application from la into a lb the us immigration denied the petition because we were not able to change the status for a filed petition to do so we would have had to file a new one however not worst enough he told us not to leave the us and to stay during he was filing a petition for a b visa to gain additional time to prepare a new la applicationmr martin valko took on our case he told us that it will be difficult but he would try to rescue the case thoroughly explained the case to us after his analysis of the immigration laws and regulations and promised us to do the best after he had all our paperwork he and his legal team needed only a few days to prepare the new la petition l for the family we used the premium processing service of the uscis and we had our approval after less than one week we then scheduled a visa appointment at the us consulate in berlin germany the following week and our new la and l visas have been granted for a full one yearwhen searching for a good immigration attorney you will find thousands of attorneys and all of them promise to be the best and to do the best work after all this experience we can tell that there are only a few really good immigration attorney out there and it is hard to find them we found one of them and are proud of this work and we cant thank him enough mr martin valko knows what he is talking about he has a lot of experience in immigration law and his rates are absolutely fair for all of those people in need of an immigration attorney we recommend the law firm of chavez  valko in dallas tx provox systems dallas txchavez  valko llpweetabixtourist ratedthis is crazyi dont doubthis is crazyi dont doubt that the other attorneys are good im sure they are but im gonna talk about gary frost gary frost is amazing i called the law firm in tears and he made me see that i was over stressing about something that was not even a problem at allmy abusive ex boyfriend who is like totally trashy and lame filed a k petition and talked me into signing it during the time that i was on zoloft and xanax due to the stress in the relationship which i did love makes people act stupidlater on when i realized he cheated on me i cancelled itmy main concern was knowing that this would cause trouble later on like for example when i go to the states on vacation because me and my family have been going there since i was like two i was stressed and i appreciate his kind words which meant so much to me as well as his legal advice he broke with all the stereotypes of the mean and cold attorneys now in spanishno se que tal sean los otros abogados pero yo voy a hablar de gary frost llame a las oficinas asi como que llorando y me hizo ver que estaba asi como que preocupandome por algo que nada que verel naco de mi ex novio dio de alta una peticion k y me convencio de iniciar todo el rollo y cuando me di cuenta que el muy loser me engaño pues obvio que la quise cancelar osea nadie va andar con alguien que lo trate mal y encima hablaba mal de los mexicanos a veces solo por ser el norteamericano osea que le pasabami preocupacion principal era saber que estoy me pudiera afectar en un futuro y el me hizo saber que no tenia porque preocuparme de una manera bastante amigable aprecio mucho su asesoria legal pero aun mas sus palabras de aliento cuando yo estaba toda nerviosa y desesperada y necesitaba escuchar que todo iba a estar bienchavez  valko llpterry h ratedwe did it my wife is coming to america no words can ever convey my heartfelt thanks to chavez and valko’s  martin valko and eduardo amaro my heart is full of joy as i write the following…the law firm of chavez and valko was referred to me by an acquaintance and i met with martin valko immediately upon returning from my wedding in zhengzhou china and i liked him very much the road to a successful migration can be a perilous one never dreaming our case would require almost five years and three visa interviews to complete the us department of state made several errors that no one could have foreseen the us consulate in guangzhou sent our case back  times and chavez and valko reaffirmed it and then finally on the third try the consulate visa officers realized ours was a bona fide marriage i know this placed additional burden and countless manhours on chavez and valko i was concerned when our first visa interview was not successful in march  and i was concerned the law firm would drop us as clients i met with mr valko and he put all my worries to rest they are true to their word and a law firm of the highest honor mr valko and mr amaro our paralegal never once wavered and i can’t imagine anyone anywhere at anytime fighting any harder for our case all these years they paid the closest of attention to slightest of details when we gave up they kept fighting for us chavez and valko’s law firm has grown in size since over the last five years but those assigned to our case in the beginning…remained on our case until the very end may god bless the law firm of chavez and valko and their staff members chavez  valko llpfelipenvanessarosas ratedwe would like to thank mr valwe would like to thank mr valko and his paralegal jessica for their help and hard work my husband is from mexico and has been here since he was eight years old originally we contacted mr valkos office to help my husband get a visa in the meantime the new deferred action came out and mr valko suggested that we go this route since it appeared that my husband met the criteria immigration received my husbands application for deferred action in september  he went to his biometrics appointment in midoctober  received an approval notification in midnovember  and three days letter received his work permit in the mail now he has his social security card and driver license no more worries that my husband will go to work one day and not return home because he was picked up by immigration again we are so thankful and appreciative for the great work mr valko and jessica have done for us they always return your call or email very quickly and you dont always get that kind of service from attorneys offices mr valko exuded confidence in our case and his expertise and that in turn eased our minds a great deal we felt like we were treated as human beings by people who cared about our situation there is still more to do and we will stay with mr valko because we can trust him if he can help you then he will if he cannot help you he will be honest and tell you so if you have any immigration issues this is the office to go to we have recommended mr valko to other family our friends and strangers that we have heard are in need of immigration assistance vanessa  felipe rosaswarren n abrams attorney at lawkenyan g ratedthe law offices of warren abram are the best legal representation one could ever ask for from the first day i walked into their office i knew that they had my best interests at heart and my case would be handled with a sincere personal touch i felt like i was among family the office staff rhea and rose were very personable yet professional and kept me informed about where in the process my case was and advised me accordingly on what the next step was my attorney mr abram is an outstanding lawyer and an absolute asset to have on your side even before taking on my case he listened intently was extremely compassionate and very thorough in explaining to me what we would be facing and what needed to be done to achieve a positive outcome he is very knowledgeable of the court system and always seemed to be steps ahead and able to foresee any curve ball that was thrown at us all throughout my case he was always available to answer my questions and especially very prompt at returning my calls he was also very comforting and quick to alleviate my worries when i would panic he is also very understanding of the financial burden of legal representation and willing to let me pay him in installments which most other attorneys would not let you do his preparation was extremely detailed and he was relentless in his pursuit for a positive verdict he fought for me and won my case and i am forever thankful for his dedication and expertise at the end i felt he was like a father to me trying to protect me and my career one needs to look no further for representation as he is an amazing attorneychavez  valko llprafael p ratedhi my name is rafael pantoja im originally from mexico but im a

process i finally received my us permanent residency green card in august  this is life changing in so many areas i work in a midmanagement position for a fortune  company in the dallasfort worth metroplex area and sometime in the mids my company migrated its immigration legal representatives from a very expensive washington dc area firm to the much more affordable firm of chavez  valko in the dfw area while there were a few parties involved in my process the champions have been martin valko and his team of paralegals including the ever available shannon at chavez  valko as anyone who may have gone through the us immigration system can attest the suspense and uncertainties in the process can be a teeth grinding experience throughout my dual intent hb  perm process martin and his team kept me updated performed timely execution of the series of uscis document filing and notifications state department visa applications provided me and my family reassurance during uscis delays and pretty much held my hands through it all i am very grateful for their hard work proactive professionalism dedication to my personal process and uncompromising commitment to deliver i am already gladly recommending the firm of chavez  valko to family friends and anyone else who may have any form of immigration issues whether they are being handled through their corporateemployer sponsorship or personally eric fein  associates attorney at lawchristopherindallas ratederic fein is in a class all toeric fein is in a class all to himself when you need the toughest attorney willing to do whatever it takes to win your case you need eric fein eric specializes in business corporation insurance intellectual property among other areas however what eric fein most specializes in is winning hes like a pit bull once he gets a hold of the other side he doesnt let go eric has represented me in a number of cases and has always delivered a positive outcome even when the odds were stacked against i have seen eric take on the largest of insurance companies that have unlimited resources and were willing to do anything to deny a claim even though it was a valid claim when eric was done they didnt know what hit them he did circles around them and showed them that the law was not on their side and neither was he in the end it wound up costing the insurance company a whole lot more than if they would have just paid the claim in the first place and this type of outcome is typical with eric fein eric is not a low cost attorney and he typically charges by the hour but the end value he delivers is well worth it when you absolutely need to win and want the toughest guy in town willing to do whatever it takes to win eric fein is your guy if you are an insurance company and eric fein is the opposing counsel in a claim you are screwed and better pay now because the outcome will not be in your favor on a scale of 0 eric fein gets an  chavez  valko llpswarans ratedi’m a srnetweaver administrator at a fortune  company which manufactures and distributes steel my company retains chavez  valko immigration law firm and their corporate immigration team initially assisted my company with the transfer of my hb and h petitions from my previous employer after i was “ported” the company filed a new labor perm application in a faster category and the i0 petition was then filed to recapture my earlier priority date from my old petition which was successful our cases were not very simple as the i green card applications for me and my wife were accepted first without our kids
