governance news press releases publications white papers press kit media contact contact us become a partner career opportunities power of the bead the power of the bead cytosorbents has developed a unique and powerful blood filtration and purification technology based on its proprietary biocompatible highly porous polymer bead platform each of these spherical beads are approximately the size of a grain of salt and synthesized to contain millions of optimallysized pores and channels these pores and channels collectively have a massive surface area that enable the bead to behave like a tiny sponge to safely bind and effectively remove a broad range of inflammatory and toxic substances from whole blood and plasma via pore capture and surface adsorption large substances such as blood cells cannot get into the pores and go around the bead unaffected similarly very small substances such as electrolytes are too small to be captured and go through the beads unaffected but appropriately sized substances migrate into the pores of the beads and get adsorbed to the external and internal surfaces of the pores and channels never to come out variations of these beads form the basis of cytosorbents’ flagship product cytosorb® for the treatment of deadly inflammation seen in critical illnesses and after cardiac surgery and hemodefend™ for the purification of transfused blood products of contaminants that can cause potentially dangerous transfusion reactions stateoftheart blood purification technology cytosorbents’ advanced bead technology combines numerous advantages into a single blood purification platform proprietary polymer technology cytosorbents’ beads are composed of a specially modified chemically inert polystyrenic copolymer protected by  issued us patents and multiple applications pending worldwide highly biocompatible the beads are iso  certified for biocompatibility hemocompatibility no genotoxicity no cytotoxicity no acute sensitivity and no complement activation pure no residual organics no leachables meets usp particulate standards for large parenteral injections massive surface area a single  ml cartridge filled with cytosorb® beads has more than  square meters of internal and external surface area on which to adsorb and remove toxic substances selective multimodal separation blood is composed of a wide range of substances ranging from water cells electrolytes hormones sugars lipids and proteins the technology achieves selectivity by using size exclusion as the first step in separation next the hydrophobic “waterfearing” polymer effectively adsorbs hydrophobic substances and excludes hydrophilic “waterloving” ones substances that do not adsorb leave the bead while those that do adsorb will migrate further and further into the beads lost in the vast network of channels unable to escape excellent adsorption of proteins bioactive lipids and toxins many of the inflammatory mediators that drive the deadly inflammatory process including cytokines toxins activated complement enzymes and bioactive lipids are preferentially removed by the technology superior kinetics beads are in direct contact with blood actively removing substance with no need for them to diffuse across a semipermeable membrane as with dialysis and hemofiltration concentration dependent removal high concentrations of toxins provide a driving force gradient to push substances into the pores of the bead because of this the technology is very good at removing toxic levels of substances as the concentration of the substance decreases so does the ability of the device to extract it this creates an inherent “selftitrating” aspect to the technology that prevents the excessive removal of substances and makes it difficult to overtreat gamma stable thermostable and chemically inert the polymer is very robust and stable allowing easy gamma sterilization stability at a broad range of temperatures and resistance to chemical change in most physiologic environments rapidly customized the beads can be easily modified during polymer synthesis to create beads with identical chemical structure but with very different porous structures for example beads can be made with very small pores similar to activated charcoal to remove drugs and small molecules alternatively the pores can be made very large to capture very large antibodies and other substances even larger than  kda in addition the beads can be further modified to incorporate most major mechanisms to separate substances including polarity charge sizeexclusion and affinity broad spectrum “mix and match” capability the ability to mix and match beads with different extraction capabilities provides a flexibility to remove a broad range of substances that no other technology can match high flow low resistance blood can flow rapidly through a beadfilled device with low resistance achieving flow rates of  mlmin without causing hemolysis or high pressure drops across the device stable with long shelf life solid state chemistry with no cells biologics or other perishable materials gamma sterilized with year shelf life at room temperature technology is the beneficiary of more than m in government funding cytosorbents’ blood and physiologic fluid purification technology aims to solve some of the most important unmet medical needs in medicine from treating lifethreatening illnesses in the intensive care unit to reducing dangerous complications of surgery to ensuring the quality and safety of the blood supply it combines the company’s proprietary hemocompatible porous polymer bead platform with robust and costeffective manufacturing compatibility with a worldwide infrastructure of existing dialysis and heartlung machines ease of
