scholarships retired social services worker and school of social work alumna melvarene adair has established a charitable gift annuity that directs nearly  million to the school of social work—one of the largest gifts in the school’s history the money—to be supplemented with  in state matching funds—will be used to create a  million endowment for the johnsonhowardadair distinguished professorship

established at a school of social work and the adair scholarships will support master of social work students in perpetuity adair’s experiences in the s as a young social worker in some of north carolina’s most rural communities led her to focus the professorship towards a scholar or distinguished teacher interested “in the impact and influence of poverty on individuals families and communities” at that time adair—who earned a master’s degree in social work from unc in —spent much of her time making home visits to determine how much financial help or “welfare” households would receive she had not yet fully grasped the significant impact she had on the individuals’ and families’ lives with whom she worked “i didn’t understand that these dollars meant so much more to them than they did to me” she said as she recalled one family who cooked their meals in the fireplace over an open flame “i didn’t understand how needy they were i think at the time i was thinking more about saving the taxpayers’ money i’d be more generous today” indeed adair has been generous and hopes her gift will ultimately help attract more students to the profession of social work “i’ve gotten the impression that everybody wants to go into mental health because of the prestige but i want people to realize that this is a good field too” she said carolina’s school of social work is one of the nation’s leaders in social work research and education and is consistently ranked among the top  schools of social work in the nation unc alumnus creates second scholarship honors family members dual

bank corporation koury writes in the sept  letter to ceo john cameron coburn and other officials of the publicly traded bank in nine years koury says shareholders have seen a  percent return on their investment based on the banks sept  close of  a share even as the ceos base salary before bonus and options rose by  percent to  i cannot understand increasing the compensation and benefits  while the shareholders of the company continue to receive no dividends and watch our stock price decline koury writes i believe that it is time for the company to retain a qualified financial advisor to explore the companys strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a sale koury included a copy of his letter in a us securities and exchange commission filing that reports his stock holdings in cape fear those filings show that he has purchased more than  shares in the bank since late july and currently owns a total of  shares or  percent of cape fear stock coburn asked for a response confirmed he had received kourys letter i always welcome comment from shareholders coburn says our board will consider it thoroughly and comment at the appropriate time as for cape fears financial performance he adds we have a longterm plan for success that we believe will create results for our shareholders from its opening in june  until october  cape fear was known as the bank of wilmington
