conclusion of the prepared remarks i would now like to turn the call over to mr bill marshall  vice president investor relations for altria client services please go ahead unverified participant thank you crystal good morning and thank you for joining us were here this morning with marty barrington altrias ceo and billy gifford altrias cfo to discuss altrias  first quarter business results earlier today we issued a press release providing these results which is available on our website at altriacom and through the altria investor app during our call today unless otherwise stated were comparing results to the same period in  our remarks contain forwardlooking and cautionary statements and projections of future results please review the forwardlooking and cautionary statements section at the end of todays earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of altrias board the timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors altria reports its financial results in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles todays call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis adjusted results exclude special items that affect the comparability of reported results descriptions of these nongaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in todays earnings release now ill turn the call over to marty martin j barrington  altria group inc thanks bill  good morning everyone thank you for joining us altria is off to a solid start in  despite some shortterm headwinds we grew first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share by  against a difficult comparison in the yearago quarter when we grew adjusted diluted eps more than  the smokeable product segment continued to generate strong results which offset lower equity earnings from our beer investment and the effect of the voluntary product recall in the smokeless product segment our business fundamentals remain strong and we believe were wellpositioned for the rest of the year earlier this morning we reaffirmed our  full year adjusted diluted eps growth guidance of  to  and we continue to expect adjusted diluted eps growth to be weighted to the second half here is some color on the businesses the smokeable product segment grew its adjusted operating companies income by more than  pm usa estimates that cigarette industry volume declines were in line with the historical rate as the industry lapped the improving consumer conditions and benefits from lower gasoline prices against this backdrop the industry remains competitive and pm usa saw several competitive product expansions and promotional changes in this environment pm usa remained focused on maximizing income while maintaining momentum on marlboro across its measures of brand strength which include equity demographics retail share and profitability pm usa implemented list price increases in march and continued to compete effectively at retail pm usa was steady in its strategy and execution resulting in strong smokeable segment price realization in the machinemade large cigar category middletons focus on the more profitable tipped cigar segment continued to generate good results and the business is performing very well the cigar category strength and trade inventory movements drove middletons reported shipment volume up over  in the quarter turning to the smokeless product segment it was a disappointing quarter resulting from the product recall caused by a product tampering incident usstc did the right thing by moving quickly to address the issue with consumers the trade and other stakeholders but the recalls effect shows in the numbers smokeless segment adjusted oci declined  and usstc estimates that the recall had an approximately retail share point impact the recall is concluded and usstc has now largely completed replenishing wholesale and retail inventories we expect that usstc will recover the share loss over time turning to innovative tobacco products altria continues to develop a portfolio of products to meet evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences in april nu mark announced the expansion of markten to approximately  more stores and the availability of three more flavors for its adult vapors winter mint summer fusion and smooth cream in heated tobacco altria continues to partner with philip morris international in seeking regulatory authorization to commercialize the iqos system in the us both the modified risk tobacco product and premarket tobacco product applications for iqos now have been submitted with the fda pm usas team continues to build its us commercialization plan for iqos so in summary we believe that altria remains wellpositioned for the rest of the year and thus we are reaffirming our full year guidance now heres billy for more detail on our performance william f gifford  altria group inc thanks marty and good morning everyone let me start with the smokeable products segment adjusted oci margins expanded by  percentage points in the first quarter to  due primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses smokeable reported cigarette shipment volume declined  in the quarter after adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors pm usa estimates that its cigarette volume declined approximately  in line with pm usas estimate for the industry decline rate in addition californias cigarette set which went into effect on april  will also affect shipment volumes in the short term pm usas first quarter retail share was  down  share point marlboros retail share declined by  share point to  in smokeless adjusted oci margins decreased by  percentage points to  driven principally by the recall impact partially offset by higher pricing the recall drove usstcs shipment volume down  in the quarter usstc estimates that smokeless industry volume grew at approximately  over the past six months it was a tough quarter for wine ste michelles adjusted oci of  million was  lower than last year and its margins contracted  percentage points to  due to lower volume and higher cost ste michelles lower volume was driven by wholesalers reducing yearend inventory and the timing of the easter holiday which occurred in the first quarter of last year lets now turn to our beer investment as a reminder abis fourth quarter  results are included in our first quarter results due to the reporting lag in the quarter altrias reported equity earnings from our investment in abi were  million these results included net pretax charges of  million for abi special items as abi noted in its fourth quarter earnings release its underlying results were negatively impacted by a challenging environment in brazil and marktomarket losses related to abis hedging of its sharebased compensation payment programs we of course continue to focus on our shareholders in the quarter we returned a large amount of cash to them paying nearly  billion in dividends and repurchasing over  million in shares as of march  altria had approximately  billion remaining in the current  billion share repurchase program we continue to expect completing this program by the end of the second quarter of  as marty mentioned we continue to expect that our  adjusted diluted earnings growth will be higher in the second half this is due primarily to the financial effect of usstcs recall this quarter and the benefit of reporting four full quarters of equity income from our abi investment lastly a quick word on iris retail market share reporting as a result of iris most recent database restatement cigarette and smokeless retail market shares had been restated share information for each quarter of  is available in our press release you remember that iri uses a sample of retail stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends historical trends of restated numbers are generally consistent with those under iris previously reported numbers that wraps up our results marty and i are now happy to take your questions while the calls are being compiled ill direct your attention to altriacom along with todays earnings release and our nongaap reconciliations weve posted for your reference a usual list of quarterly metrics including pricing inventory and other housekeeping items operator were ready for the questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of bonnie herzog with wells fargo bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc i actually have a question on marlboro and it looks like youve been losing slight share behind marlboro over the past several quarters based on the adjusted data so i guess id like to better understand your current strategy with the brand and if some of the new skus havent been as effective as you had hoped and what your innovation pipeline looks like for the remainder of the year behind the brand martin j barrington  altria group inc hi good morning bonnie thanks for the question listen i think the best explanation of marlboro was the one we gave at cagny just a little while ago as you know marlboro remains the strongest brand by far in the cigarette category its the iconic brand in the category i think its also useful to remember what our strategy is our strategy in smokeable is to maximize income while maintaining momentum on marlboro over time and so as weve explained momentum is viewed by us across various metrics let me just mention a few of them one is brand equity and brand equity for marlboro has never been higher indeed i think the number we gave was  points higher than the next nearest competitor demographics are good as you know weve stabilized its share among the important  to  cohort and actually marlboro share is very good across all the rest of the cohorts as well its profitability is undeniable i think the number we put up at cagny was  billion in retail sales in  and then we come to share and so with share we look at it over time its down twotenths in the quarter to be sure but thats why we look at it over time because promotions and the like come in and out of the quarter if you look at it over a longer period i dont know say  weve gained – i dont – call it  share points to  share points so the strategy hasnt changed at all its to be the leading brand in the category and to maximize its profitability bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then i wanted to ask a question on your wine business you mentioned it was certainly a tough quarter your margins were very low probably the lowest theyve actually been for a number of years so guess i was hoping you guys could drill down a little further in some of the things that hurt your business during the quarter you mentioned your volume was very weak due to the wholesalers reducing yearend inventory so more color on this and then any sense what your volume was excluding this inventory fluctuation and then finally this begs a question which ive asked you guys about before but would love to hear any updated thoughts or plans that you might have for this business over the next several years in terms of further investments and if you need to actually increase your investments possibly to turn the business around thank you martin j barrington  altria group inc okay thanks for the question listen i think you have to put the wine quarter in context if you look at its income growth over the last five years its grown doubledigit call it i dont know  give or take and so you have to place the quarter in context they had a tough quarter theres no denying it there was inventory that got burned off from the end of the year and the easter holiday was pushed back into the second quarter this year so that has the effect on all the numbers if you called out in terms of the volume and obviously in terms of the margin the wine company does a terrific job out there no quarter is perfect and this is ours i guess for the wine business but they do a great job i dont see the need for anyone to think that we have to step up in any material way the investment in the wine company it was just a tough quarter bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful then just maybe one final quick question for me martin j barrington  altria group inc sure bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc on your eps guidance this year i just wanted to confirm that it does include any potential expense associated with the commercialization of iqos this year in terms of any hiring you might need to do marketing store openings et cetera thanks martin j barrington  altria group inc yes its all in bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc perfect thank you martin j barrington  altria group inc okay thanks for calling operator your next question comes from the line of steve powers with ubs stephen r powers  ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks martin j barrington  altria group inc hi steve stephen r powers  ubs securities llc hey so i wanted to pick up first just to round out the marlboro discussion martin j barrington  altria group inc sure stephen r powers  ubs securities llc marty you talked about i think in the response to bonnie that share trends amongst that important younger adult smoker segment had stabilized martin j barrington  altria group inc yeah stephen r powers  ubs securities llc just a little bit more color on – to the extent you have the granularity – what the sequential movement in that cohort looks like over the last year plus is it similar to the overall where stable means down slightly or is actually truly stable martin j barrington  altria group inc i think the last time we looked at it it was equal to or slightly greater than and actually if you look at it steve from when we implemented the architecture in  thats when it really began to stabilize and obviously with the implementation of the architecture marlboro green and marlboro black in particular are helping in that cohort stephen r powers  ubs securities llc okay thats great thats great and then a question on iqos and really its a clarification for my benefit as i understand it your joint efforts with pmi right now are based on a relationship whereby youd effectively be licensing iqos ip owned by pmi for commercialization in the us is that the correct understanding martin j barrington  altria group inc i might be a tad more precise on that if you let me theyre sourcing the product to us as you know theyre licensing it into us for commercialization which is essentially the inverse of the relationship we have on evapor which is we source the product for them for evapor outside the united states and we license the trademark and the ip to them the only distinction of course is that before the spinoff there was ip under the altria tent which we retained at the spinoff stephen r powers  ubs securities llc right okay thats clarifying and i guess the question im thinking about is there any reason – i know this is hypothetical but just any reason why we couldnt evolve to a structure in the future where you would end up taking outright ownership of iqos ip at least as related to the us market is there anything that would prevent that kind of outcome martin j barrington  altria group inc no i would agree with you thats it hypothetical though and theres nothing i guess that could foreclose a different arrangement being struck than the one that we have today but what ive described is the arrangement we have today with pmi stephen r powers  ubs securities llc okay thank you very much martin j barrington  altria group inc all right steve thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi good morning martin j barrington  altria group inc good morning chris christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi i just wanted to ask a question about the smokeless division and just to make sure im looking at it properly if you kind of quantify the market share loss around  basis points of market share your numbers you gave in the press release show you lost  basis points am i getting to like an underlying performance kind of ex the recall of how you performed at retail william f gifford  altria group inc yeah chris good morning this is billy i think thats the proper way to look at it chris what we quantified was about  basis points the impact of the recall and youre right in the actuals we were down  basis points christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc and have you had any of the skus back on the shelf long enough to see how that rebuild is going of market share william f gifford  altria group inc yeah as marty mentioned we are pretty much done replenishing the outofstocks that occurred because of the recall at retail and we are seeing share recover now remember whenever you have that consumer purchasing other products in the marketplace it takes a bit of time for us to recover the share but were seeing promising signs christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and just a quick question if i could a bit of a followup on the evapor business pmi has launched a new form of their platform for their evapor product in the uk is that technology that altria has access to or has helped develop could you have access to that product for the us market martin j barrington  altria group inc i can describe generally to you the way that were handling it at vapor which is in addition to the two agreements that i described with steve i think you know chris that we also have a technology sharing agreement with pmi to work on vapor products and the way that basically works at the risk of an oversummary is technology thats developed under that agreement can be deployed by each of us in our respective geographies christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thats very helpful thanks for your time this morning martin j barrington  altria group inc thank you for calling operator your next question comes from the line of matthew grainger with morgan stanley matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc hi good morning everyone thanks martin j barrington  altria group inc good morning matt matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc just a quick followup on cigarette industry volumes which improved a bit sequentially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter despite the fact that retail consumption in measured channels appeared to slow we had some headwinds from slower cstore trends difficult comp so how did that  compare to your expectations and are there any favorable dynamics at the consumer level maybe consumer confidence that youd point to as having help support volumes in the short term martin j barrington  altria group inc i guess our view is that its going back to about where we expected matt is the honest answer if you look at longterm trends call it a fiveyear trend for the industry its about  as you know we were flatter there for the period that weve discussed previously last year was at  and now for this quarter were back at about  as our estimate so our view is that the secular decline is what drives this it has since the s and it looks to us like its going about that in the quarter there may be some movements in and out because weve got some excise tax activity particularly in california but i dont think its material over the course of the year matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc okay thanks marty and on iqos are there any updates you can provide on kind of the level of or pace of engagement at the state level as youre talking to legislators about tax treatment any sense you can give on timeline and your level of confidence that you could potentially align those discussions with the outcome of the fdas review of premarket approval martin j barrington  altria group inc yeah thats an interesting question we are talking to state legislators about the policy issue of which iqos is but a part of having differential taxing obviously on lower risk products that would make good sense and tax policy gets changed over time so were working on that but i dont have anything new to announce on that but it is one of the elements of our work streams matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc okay thanks and if i could squeeze in one last one sorry martin j barrington  altria group inc sure matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc just with the advent of deeming in the vapor space just curious any observations on what the implications have been at retail since august have there been changes in retail or inventory levels in vapor have you seen better flexibility in being able to secure and manage shelf space as a result of those rules going into effect martin j barrington  altria group inc no i wouldnt say that id distinguish probably how the dynamics with respect to our vapor business which as you know is going quite well with markten xl you saw big boost in the number of stores that were in we see very good consumer response to the new product i would say the thing to watch probably from an industry dynamic are the vape shops so i know youre familiar with that phenomenon but they now have to deal with fda regulation where they didnt have to deal with any before so we have seen some evidence that theres been a reduction in the number of vape shops and that the volume is moving to more traditional channels which would be a good development for our business of course matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc okay thanks marty martin j barrington  altria group inc thanks matt operator your next question comes from the line of nik modi with rbc capital markets nik modi  rbc capital markets llc hi everyone martin j barrington  altria group inc hey nik nik modi  rbc capital markets llc hey a couple questions just – marty maybe you can just comment on nat sherman and how that integration is going and if youre seeing more space – more of your fair share of space in that higherend of the back bar and then the broader picture question is on iqos and i guess as you guys think about your plans to invest ahead of the approval process what kind of consumer work have you been able to do how do you know that the consumer is going to uptake on this product because obviously since you cant really launch it in the us until you get that approval im just curious on the science and the research that youre doing with the consumer to get a sense of what the uptake could be martin j barrington  altria group inc sure so first on nat sherman were working through our plans now we closed in january if memory serves and were getting that ready to roll so i dont really have a lot to tell you about nat sherman yet because were just getting started on the iqos consumer work the situation of course which is youre right we dont have the product in market so we cant do any inmarket consumer work but we certainly can do outofmarket work which we are working on and in particular we are using the learnings from pmi which i think weve discussed before so many of us have been in the international markets and our teams are working quite closely the idea basically is to try to extract trade and consumer insights and then try to apply them to what we know about our market here and so were working on all of that now and then when we get in the lead market thats when were going to learn more once we have that product available for consumers so were trying to do as much as we can to get a fast start but youre right to point out and weve pointed out until you get it in the consumers hands you have to be careful nik modi  rbc capital markets llc and i guess marty the followup to that is having been in the international business are there any markets that you believe are analogous to the us market just in terms of consumer behavior tax structures demographics martin j barrington  altria group inc i think the better way to look at it nik is that theres no perfect market but that each of the markets if youre asking the right question can give you insights into the behavior so obviously in terms of traditional cigarette markets its customary to compare the united states more to western europe but obviously there are insights to be generated from seeing the uptick thats taken place in japan so rather than to get locked in on a geography were focused in on the insights nik modi  rbc capital markets llc excellent thanks so much martin j barrington  altria group inc okay nik good to hear from you operator your next question comes from the line of judy hong with goldman sachs judy e hong  goldman sachs  co thank you good morning martin j barrington  altria group inc good morning judy judy e hong  goldman sachs  co so i just had a few follow ups one is just california and pennsylvania just kind of a color that – any color you could give us in terms of the impact from the excise tax increase in those markets martin j barrington  altria group inc our estimate is that it will have about a  impact on volume this year judy e hong  goldman sachs  co and that theres no changes based on what youve seen so far in those markets martin j barrington  altria group inc no not so far judy e hong  goldman sachs  co okay and then just in terms of guidance i know at cagny you talked about the potential recallrelated expenses in smokeless and i think at that time it wasnt clear whether it was going to be included in the adjusted earnings growth numbers so now youre including it but you didnt change the adjusted eps numbers so does that sort of imply that may be the underlying trends are actually slightly better than what you wouldve thought during cagny william f gifford  altria group inc hi judy this is billy as we answered that question at cagny youll recall when we provide guidance we run a range of scenarios that are included in the guidance and so thatll take into account these types of events and so we feel the same that we felt at cagny we feel good about guidance and thats why we were able to reaffirm today judy e hong  goldman sachs  co got it okay and then just lastly marty on markten xl just in terms of the conversion rate that youre seeing on that product versus the prior versions is there anything you can share with us on that front martin j barrington  altria group inc yes weve had much much better return business on the new product than we did on the former product and so we can measure that by the number of cartridges that are purchased versus the device and theyre much much better judy e hong  goldman sachs  co got it okay thank you martin j barrington  altria group inc nice to speak with you operator your next question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen martin j barrington  altria group inc good morning vivien you there vivien azer  cowen  co llc i am so marty i just wanted to doubleclick on your comment around promotional activity from competitors in the quarter can you elaborate on that at all and perhaps contextualize it in the broader context of the competitive landscape over time because i know we see these episodes of competitive activity bubble up from time to time thank you martin j barrington  altria group inc thats probably the best way to describe it look its always competitive and were always monitoring and were always adjusting thats basically how it works we were trying to provide some color in the quarter about seeing some competitive product expansions and some promotional changes and pm usa has adjusted appropriately as it always does so this is the sturm und drang that goes on i think at retail and in competition but we watch it carefully of course but of course if you look at net pricing for the quarter you can see that pm usas realization was still above  so thats what we were trying to convey vivien which was some color about that vivien azer  cowen  co llc thats helpful thank you a bigger picture theoretical question if you will yesterday president trump noted that he would be open to a gas price increase and we havent seen one since  and i know there are a number of macro factors that you look at to determine kind of the health of the consumer and the potential impact on cigarette volumes but can you just offer any commentary on how you guys would think about a gas tax increase impacting cigarette volumes thanks martin j barrington  altria group inc yeah obviously that announcement just came out yesterday and so were taking a look at what it might do to the cstore trade obviously gas is a big deal at cstore and thats where most of our traffic runs through so i guess wed have to – well have to take a look and see what it is i know that there are sort of entrenched interests on both sides of the question about whether the gas tax should be raised so well have to wait and see i guess vivien azer  cowen  co llc thats helpful and then the last one for me from the fda from a menthol perspective any updates there martin j barrington  altria group inc none vivien azer  cowen  co llc okay thanks very much martin j barrington  altria group inc all right thanks for calling vivien operator your next question comes from the line of adam spielman with citi adam j spielman  citigroup global markets ltd hi thank you for taking the question so as i look back as i think about the quarter as a whole youve had really strong growth in oci in smokeable against a really tough comp smokeless segment yes youve had the recall but excluding that profit looks really strong as well on the other hand i guess market share in cigarettes has been a little bit disappointing so the question is as you look forward is there any reason to suppose it wont return to a lets say a more normal pattern with perhaps less price realization a little less oci but equally a better market share trend in cigarettes that would be the first question martin j barrington  altria group inc okay well let me respond to that its always a balance is the honest answer the strategy on the smokeable business as you know adam is to try to maximize our income and we try to do that and we have done that i think as you point out quite well over time at the same time we want to make sure we have momentum on the key brands and were mindful of that so the honest answer is its a balance adam j spielman  citigroup global markets ltd fine okay and then just turning back to the fda can you – at cagny you gave quite a lot of detail about the expense of putting in applications for authorization for your cigars and eproducts of various sorts can you just give an update about how those applications are going whether youve had any response back from the fda and whether there has been any news there what news is there martin j barrington  altria group inc i would say it continues to be as we described it at cagny which is theres much more activity in terms of the interaction between the agency and our operating companies about their applications as they work through and youre right its much more expensive than the fda has estimated and so were having to be mindful about which products we pick in order to put applications in because they come with an expense look our strategy is to engage constructively with the agency and to try to encourage it to make good policy decisions and that includes on approval of our submissions we continue to believe that our submissions are wellfounded and in good form but its a process and you have to go through that with fda so i would say its been more of the same since we last discussed this at cagny adam j spielman  citigroup global markets ltd okay thank you very much martin j barrington  altria group inc thanks for calling in operator your next question comes from the line of michael lavery with piper jaffray michael lavery  piper jaffray good morning martin j barrington  altria group inc michael good morning and welcome michael lavery  piper jaffray thank you you mentioned in your release that your strategy on middleton is maximizing income and obviously that didnt reference share momentum i dont think thats new but can you confirm that and then either way can you just speak a little bit to your thinking there because certainly the volume momentum in cigars broadly typically is a bit better than cigarettes but is it just that the economics arent as attractive or can you just frame why share momentum there wouldnt be part of the strategy william f gifford  altria group inc sure michael this is billy thanks for the question if you recall when we look at the cigar category you have it in basically three segments youve got the tipped where black  mild participates and has over about  of that segment you have the untipped and then you have the noncigarillo form we participate in the tipped and we have basically a large market share there and so thats why were running for profitability thats where most of the profitability is in the cigar category in the untipped segment theres basically a price were going on where people are competing for volume but at a very low profitability and were really not participating in that segment so it hasnt been a change for us but i think that describes the strategy and the approach we have in the cigar category michael lavery  piper jaffray okay thats good context thank you and then just one last one on nat sherman i know you are still working on plans and working on the roll out and so its still very small but in terms of the volume in the quarter would that have had any material – how much did that add is there any amount of the volume there martin j barrington  altria group inc its very small as you know that brand right now is pretty much a boutique brand and so in this quarter i wouldnt call anything out as material michael lavery  piper jaffray okay thank you very much martin j barrington  altria group inc nice to hear from you operator and your next question comes to the line of glen anderson with nuveen asset management glen richard anderson  nuveen asset management llc hey good morning thanks for the call martin j barrington  altria group inc good morning glen richard anderson  nuveen asset management llc i wanted to go back to iqos and your conversations with the states have those conversations included how the iqos would be measured as far as the msa goes are the sticks going to be counted as a regular cigarette martin j barrington  altria group inc no but thats a good question as well our operating hypothesis is that the definition under the master settlement agreement would cover the heat sticks because theyre tobacco wrapped in paper so its a parallel definition its not the same as the states but its a parallel youre right glen richard anderson  nuveen asset management llc and they would count as a cigarette then martin j barrington  altria group inc for those purposes yes sir glen richard anderson  nuveen asset management llc okay very good thank you martin j barrington  altria group inc thank you for asking operator our next question comes from the line of nik modi with rbc capital markets nik modi  rbc capital markets llc thanks for the followup marty i was just wondering – or billy if you can comment on just the general cstore environment because most companies are suggesting its been pretty tough from a traffic standpoint but it looks like cigarette industry volumes actually came in a bit better than i think most folks were looking at so i was hoping to get your characterization on kind of how you see the environment right now martin j barrington  altria group inc yeah its a good question we continue to see at least our consumer who of course are moving to the cstores we think the environment continues to be largely constructive for them nik when you look at the factors weve discussed whether its unemployment rates or housing starts or consumer confidence we have been following carefully the commentary by others in cpg about perhaps some softening for their consumer set which obviously overlaps with ours in some respects we just havent seen it yet and we havent seen that in the cstore trade for our category not yet nik modi  rbc capital markets llc perfect thanks so much martin j barrington  altria group inc okay thanks for following up operator thank you at this time i would now

investor app now ill turn the call over to marty martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks sarah good morning everyone were pleased to report yet another strong quarter for altria group we delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and for the first  months of  we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share  in the quarter and  for the yeartodate each of our reporting segments has contributed to our strong earnings performance especially the smokeable product segment led by the terrific marlboro brand so lets begin there the smokeable product segment grew adjusted operating companys income more than  in the third quarter and over  for the first  months for the yeartodate solid net price realization the benefit from the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments and higher volume continue to support doubledigit adjusted oci growth and good margin expansion the industry continued to benefit from nearterm moderation in cigarette volume declines which combined with pm usa share gains resulted in strong volume results for pm usa reported cigarette shipment volume for the quarter was up onetenth of a percent after adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors pm usa estimates that its cigarette volume was unchanged in the third quarter for the yeartodate reported cigarette shipment volume grew  and pm usa estimates that its adjusted cigarette volume increased approximately fivetenths of a percent versus the yearago period in line with strategy marlboro gained onetenth of retail share in the third quarter and twotenths for the yeartodate so our investments in the marlboro architecture continue to pay off and by all key measures – oci margin price realization volume and share – our smokeable segment is performing very well turning to the smokeless product segment usstc delivered income growth and combined retail share growth on copenhagen and skoal the smokeless product segment grew adjusted oci  in the third quarter and almost  for the first nine months primarily through higher pricing partially offset by higher promotional investments and sga expenses the iconic copenhagen brand remained the fastestgrowing brand in the category with eighttenths of retail share growth for the first nine months of  and thanks to investments in skoals equity and overall value equation the brands retail share declines continued to moderate our objective remains to seek combined share momentum on these two brands in this competitive category the wine business continued its strong performance ste michelle grew oci almost  in the third quarter and nearly  for the year todate primarily through increased volume and improved premium mix in innovative tobacco products nu mark continues pursuing disciplined innovation in evapor weve seen encouraging trial on markten xl allowing us to expand our lead market presence nu mark also continues its instore evaluation of green smokes retail positioning we focused first on getting the product right and were learning a great deal about the adult tobacco consumer response we are optimistic about these brands as we move forward and of course altria continued to return cash to shareholders we paid approximately  billion in dividends in the first nine months of  additionally we raised our quarterly dividend by  in august to an annualized rate of  per share marking our th dividend increase in  years we remain focused on our target dividend payout ratio of  of adjusted diluted eps so our yeartodate results have been very strong and we are happy with our progress against our fullyear plans thus we reaffirm that we expect to deliver adjusted diluted eps in a range of  to  representing growth of  to  from our  adjusted diluted eps base of  this guidance reflects expected moderated eps results in the fourth quarter as compared to last year due to several factors weve discussed previously including lapping the benefit from the expiration of federal tobacco quota buyout payments lapping some of the effects of a stronger economy and lower gasoline prices and a higher effective tax rate on operations additionally trade inventories for cigarettes may moderate going forward and unfavorable foreign currency translation could affect prioryear comparisons of earnings from altrias equity investment in sabmiller finally let us provide you with a word on the proposed ab inbev combination with sabmiller we know there is a great deal of interest in this transaction and we look forward to providing the details for us at the appropriate time but as i hope you can appreciate we have to wait until final terms have been reached before doing so but until then heres a brief update and some background on this transaction earlier this month ab inbev and sabmiller announced an agreement in principle on key terms regarding a possible transaction between the two companies yesterday ab inbev and sabmiller jointly announced that the uk takeover panel has extended the relevant deadline until november   we are pleased to see this transaction moving forward and that the parties are reporting progress has been made including ab inbevs completion of confirmatory due diligence of sabmiller reconfirming the financial and other terms of the possible offer and confirming the availability of financing facilities the extension gives ab inbev and sabmiller additional time to finalize the details necessary for ab inbev to announce a firm intention to make an offer for sabmiller as you know altria has been a shareholder of sabmiller since  indeed its largest shareholder the sabmiller stake has provided us with access to the global brewing profit pool diversified our business contributed nicely to our longterm earnings growth and strengthened our balance sheet of course the approach we have always taken is to manage that asset for the best interest of altrias shareholders we believe that combining the largely complementary businesses of sab and ab inbev to create the worlds largest brewer is a compelling opportunity so we are excited about the proposed transaction and are working constructively with the parties to complete the transaction and with that ill turn things over to billy william f gifford  chief financial officer thanks marty and good morning everyone as marty mentioned stronger volume in the smokeable product segment helped deliver adjusted oci growth for the first nine months when adjusted for trade inventory changes and other factors pm usa estimates that industry cigarette volume was down  in the third quarter and five tenths of a percent for the first nine months in addition to retail share gains on marlboro lm also gained share allowing pm usas total retail share to hit  for both the quarter and first nine months this represents an increase of four tenths of retail sharepoint and half a retail sharepoint respectively from the yearago periods cigar volume growth also contributed to the smokeable product segments results middletons reported shipment volume increased just over  in the third quarter and nearly  for the first nine months and contributions from black and mild jazz and casino helped black and mild grow its leading position in the high margin cigar segment in fact black and mild casino was recently recognized by csp magazine as the  retailers choice best new product in the cigar category in total the smokeable product segment increases adjusted oci margins by  points in the third quarter to  for the yeartodate adjusted oci margins in the smokeable product segment expanded  points in the smokeless product segment usstc reported shipments increased approximately  in the third quarter and  for the first nine months we estimate that smokeless industry volume has grown approximately  over the past six months in both the third quarter and for the first nine months copenhagen and skoal grew their retail share on a combined basis in the third quarter higher pricing was partially offset by higher promotional investments and sga expenses resulting in adjusted oci margins contracting  percentage points to  for the yeartodate adjusted oci margins narrowed one tenth of a percentage point to  in the wine segment reported shipment volumes have remained robust growing at nearly  in the third quarter and over  for the first  months oci margins expanded eight tenths of a percentage point to  in the third quarter and over two points to  for the yeartodate additionally altria reported equity earnings from our sabmiller investment of  million in the third quarter and  million for the yeartodate and finally youll remember we completed our  billion share repurchase program early in the third quarter and that our board authorized a new  billion program which we expect to complete by the end of  that wraps up our results marty and i will now take your questions while the calls are being compiled ill direct your attention to altriacom along with todays earnings release for your reference we posted a list of quarterly metrics to include pricing inventory and other items operator do we have any questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of bonnie herzog with wells fargo bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc good morning everyone martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning bonnie bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc i have a twopart question on marlboro first could you talk a little bit more about your new marlboro line extension marlboro midnight and then how that brand will be positioned relative to the rest of the marlboro portfolio and then second id be curious to hear more about your marlboro app and your goals for this new technology martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks for those questions i think they both represent good examples of how marlboro is innovating at the core of our business we talk about innovation in the innovative product side but its important to remember that innovation is everywhere and boy at marlboro you see it all the time so marlboro midnight is the latest innovation under the architecture it will come out in the black family it is a unique and a bold menthol for marlboro and should help marlboro participate in the growing menthol category has a very differentiated and unique pack its going to be supported with beautiful pos to raise awareness among adult smokers and well position it as a new and exciting product in the marlboro family particularly for menthol smokers so we are excited about midnight and i think it is off to a good start i think its going to hit wholesale if i recall bonnie in midnovember and itll be retail a couple of weeks after that so you will be seeing it there and on the digital side we continue to see strong innovation as well we now have mobile couponing as you know that coupons can be delivered to adult smokers smartphones its a tremendous step forward in terms of efficiency and meeting adult smokers where they are that is now available nationally and we have launched a marlboro app its available on the two large app platforms its responsibly done ageverified and it will be a place for the brand to connect again with adult smokers in a very innovative way in the digital space so we are excited about both those innovations bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc no that makes a lot of sense and then just to clarify on the app i mean is the goal there to increase customer engagement and then could we also see more efficient promos and maybe a reduction in expenses because of this app rollout martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer all of the above what we are trying to do is connect the brand to its adult smokers and the app obviously gives us another way of doing that in addition to all of the other marketing tools that the marlboro team is doing such a good job with bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then i have a question on your smokeless business you generated higher pricing in the business and then copenhagen volume was strong but margins were down a bit so could you talk about some of the dynamics at play here and then how sustainable this better pricing is with share gains for copenhagen and then skoal still seems to be quite weak and underperforming so any updated plans to turn this around martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer sure let me mention one or two things and then ill ask billy to maybe comment on the cost side actually we are pretty spoton strategy in the smokeless business i would say you know our strategy there is to grow our income by growing volume in line or better if we can with the category and of course the category volume has picked back up again we estimate about  and actually you see copenhagen and skoal combined doing a little bit better than that at about  copenhagen is growing youre right and skoal doesnt grow share but i would point out that i think weve begun to moderate the share if you look at it sequentially its at  share points i think if you look at the yeartodate number bonnie and boy ill tell you were glad to have  share points of skoal business in this category that has  operating margins so skoal can always work harder its got to compete with both copenhagen and its principle competitor but we are pretty pleased i think they are having a solid performance over there and maybe billy can comment on your cost question william f gifford  chief financial officer sure bonnie when you look at it if you look at it on a yeartodate basis you can see margins are basically flat as marty mentioned right around the  margin base when you look at a quartertoquarter comparison or a shorter period of time you can see fluctuations based on the timing of expenses flowing through so again i think if you look at it on a yeartodate the margins are very high compared to other consumer products categories and virtually flat bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you everyone martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks for calling in bonnie operator our next question comes from the line of michael lavery with clsa michael s lavery  clsa americas llc good morning martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer hi michael good morning michael s lavery  clsa americas llc could you just talk about your market share momentum a little bit youre still getting the modest momentum on marlboro but also a very strong lift from discount just how do you prioritize that or balance that obviously you dont want to turn away discount share but certainly your focus has always been on marlboro so what are some of the priorities there and have you seen any sort of changes this is the first full quarter since the competitors transaction closed are you seeing any different competitive landscape obviously it looks like lm is still going quite strong martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah sure good questions we have not seen any changes to take the last part first we do want to modestly keep momentum on marlboro youve heard us say this before michael call it a tenth or twotenths maybe a year and you can see that yeartodate that is exactly where we are in marlboro our focus is on premium  of those shipments for pm usa are premium but lm has a role to play and what it does is it competes nicely in the discount space without growing it the industry as a whole is moving more towards premium and so what you see is that lm is basically consolidating share out of the other discount players so it works spoton strategy for pm usa thats been the strategy and thats how we are still thinking about it michael s lavery  clsa americas llc okay great and then just a followup on bonnies question about midnight could you just maybe give a sense of magnitude or how maybe it compares to something like rich blue which was another new extension in the menthol segment but seems to have been a little more limited in scale does this have any  i think rich blue had a geographical like a regional focus is this national or does it have any geographical focus and is it priced similar to the rest of black at the introductory level or does it have a different price point martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah its going to be national and well do some special price promotions to go along with the pos so that we can promote trial again in this category where you dont have a lot of the traditional marketing tools the place where you have to meet adult smokers to let them try new products is at retail so well have some price promotions there but basically michael it will be the same strategy we want them to try the brand we want them to be aware of it and then obviously as these brands get traction we can dial back the promotions so as to pursue our strategy of maximizing the income out of this category michael s lavery  clsa americas llc and then just in terms of scale would this likely be a bigger opportunity than something like a rich blue or can you put any context around what you might expect from it martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer well i wont get ahead of our skis on that except to tell you that we are very excited about the brand i think its a terrific product i think the package looks fabulous and i think its going to be very exciting for adult menthol smokers to try and we are hopeful of getting conversion from competitive smokers michael s lavery  clsa americas llc all right thank you very much martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks for calling operator our next question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen  company vivien azer  cowen  co llc hi good morning martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning vivien vivien azer  cowen  co llc i wanted to also followup on the new marlboro line extension sorry to belabor the issue i was just curious given that one of your competitors had to pull a couple of skus out of the market because the fda did not deem them to be substantially equivalent whether this is innovation that is already grandfathered in or was marketed as a different marlboro variant and is being transitioned from a tracking perspective martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i dont want to get too tactical how we bring our products to market under the fda regime but we are confident that we are fully qualified to bring that product to market vivien azer  cowen  co llc okay fair enough on the inventory levels obviously like the market share momentum has been good and easing industry volumes are certainly i think helping but as i look across your wholesale inventories theyve been growing sequentially for about five quarters now so im just curious to hear your thoughts on kind of what the right level of wholesale inventories is as we think about the central unwind in the fourthquarter martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer well they go up and down over the course of the year they usually smooth out for us over the course of the year for pm usa we do have this trend this year of course where the volume declines have not been proceeding at the same pace as before so there has been probably a little bit of disruption there you know vivien if you look at the quarterly comparisons in q there is not much to say about that they look to have about the same effect but youre right they are a little bit higher at the end of q than they were at the end of q last year so that is why weve called out in our release and also in our script that they may moderate in the fourthquarter vivien azer  cowen  co llc perfect thank you and billy just one for you i recognize currency has been a challenge for a lot of multinationals for quite some time so as i look at the sabmiller numbers this quarter in isolation i appreciate the drag from currency but as i look across prior quarters it feels like kind of there was like a currency catchup or – im just having a hard time understanding why there was such a big hit this quarter than we hadnt been seeing given where the dollar has been trending for over a year now william f gifford  chief financial officer sure thanks for the question vivien i think you have to step back first and just put in context the overall altria enterprise when you think about the earning streams we have we have very limited impact to foreign currency exposure specific to sab youre right the primary driver there is foreign currency and it is really the strengthening of the dollar against their various emerging market currencies as well as currencies around the world that is something that we have experienced yeartodate as well as in the third quarter and i think it is very reminiscence of what youre seeing with other global companies vivien azer  cowen  co llc but nothing in particular to call out in q for sabmiller william f gifford  chief financial officer nothing in particular no vivien azer  cowen  co llc okay thank you martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks for calling operator our next question comes from the line of owen bennett with nomura owen m bennett  nomura international plc good morning guys martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer hi owen owen m bennett  nomura international plc hey i just wanted to get your views on the cigarette industry volumes for the year obviously a bit of a slowdown into the second half which you said was to be expected but i was just wondering your views on how you see volumes for the full year now and then also you noted the stabilization in smokeless industry volumes now which is encouraging i was just wondering how you see the smokeless category trending from here thanks a lot martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer okay thanks for the questions so yeartodate our estimate of industry volume decline is down a half that obviously is a difference from what the historical trend has been of somewhere between  to  and well just have to see going forward what the effect is going to be but historically the longterm trend is more like  to  on the smokeable side on the smokeless side several years ago they were growing at the industry volume was growing at ish then it fell basically to nothing and now were trending back up where our estimate for the latest six months is about  so its good news that the volume has come back into the category and probably the principle driver there is that tobacco consumers continue to try different tobacco products throughout the categories that probably explains the greatest part of the change in the volume trend there but were glad that the volumes are back owen m bennett  nomura international plc okay thanks a lot martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks for the call owen operator our next question comes from the line of judy hong with goldman sachs judy e hong  goldman sachs  co thank you good morning martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer hi judy welcome judy e hong  goldman sachs  co so billy i actually do want to go back to viviens questions about the equity income because i still cant reconcile why the third quarter was down so much more than what we had been seeing in the first half of the year so it just doesnt seem to kind of jive with the first half you were down i think in the low single digits on a yearoveryear basis and then in the third quarter that dropoff was much more significant so i know there is a little bit of a sensitivity around what you can say about that performance but just anything that we should be aware of just in terms of the third quarter impact william f gifford  chief financial officer no judy i basically would reiterate what i said to vivien i think when you look at it it really is primarily driven by the currency impacts that you see in other global companies any time you look at a shortterm period youre going to see those fluctuations through time i think if you look at it over the long term it is very similar to what youre seeing with other global companies with currency impacts but thanks for the question judy e hong  goldman sachs  co okay and then maybe just in terms of fourth quarter guidance and i know you talked about the comparison getting a little bit tougher obviously the fx it sounds like its going to be another drag in terms of the fourth quarter if i just looked at your smokeable segment in the fourth quarter last year though it doesnt look like the profitability comparisons are that much tougher so is this really more of an fx issue are any other investments that we should be thinking about in the fourth quarter if you do get some volume upside that potentially youre looking to reinvest back the upside into any of those initiatives martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer no i wouldnt read that into what we said honestly the factors that we think are going to cause the moderation are called out in the release and in our remarks this morning we are lapping a very significant effect from the quota and we believe that even though the adult tobacco consumer is doing much better we are lapping the period where they got the effect towards the back end of last year in terms of gasoline prices and the like so its nothing more than that judy e hong  goldman sachs  co got it okay thank you martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks for the questions operator our next question comes from the line of matthew grainger with morgan stanley matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc hi good morning everyone martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer hi matt matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc hi so two questions first i wanted to come back to smokeless and i guess the level of net pricing was a bit higher than what we have seen recently both in absolute terms and on a yearonyear basis and this sort of comes against the backdrop of still somewhat choppy category growth and weve talked in the past about the factors playing into that im fishing a little bit here but has there been any shift in the way youre thinking about that balance between volume and pricing realization in that business over the near term martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer no the strategy remains the same when i look at the pricing its up on a percan basis about  call it for the quarter but actually if you look at it yeartodate matt its about   or something so naturally were happy to have the pricing there but with a category with  operating margins and where weve got more than  of the share we are trying to grow income principally through volume gains matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc okay thanks marty and two questions on vapor one weve seen more volatility in ecigarette category growth at least in measured channels recently and i know its hard to gauge but do you have a sense of the level of growth that were seeing in the overall vapor category to the extent you can track that and then  martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer yes matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc – and then secondly just on deeming have you had any dialogue with the fda recently to get a sense of – not so much on timing but any shift in their thinking as they are working toward a final rule on the deeming of other tobacco products martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer okay thanks for the questions good ones both the answer to the first question is evapor growth has slowed down this year so we had tripledigit gains yearoveryear a couple of years ago and then ish last year and its obvious that while the category continues to grow its not growing at anywhere near that rate with respect to deeming we know that the reg as you know has gone to omb but we do not have any insight into what they took onboard i know there were lots of comments including ours that were filed in respect of the proposed deeming regulation but we dont have any insight into what they have sent over matthew c grainger  morgan stanley  co llc okay great thanks marty martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks for calling operator our next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi good morning martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer hi chris christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc i just had two questions if i could first question and i know you had mentioned that youve seen very little change in the competitive dynamic in the category but you have you two competitors going through and selling in new retail contracts and a lot of that comes to fruition here in the fourth quarter i was just curious if youve seen any change at the retail level from that are you seeing retailers potentially making some significant change in the shelf space and that kind of thing any opportunity then for altria is what im trying to get to martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer okay the answer is we really havent but just to frame this out this isnt the first time there have been changes in the industry and naturally everybody competes really hard at retail chris so everybody has got a lot of experience with their trade programs we have evolved our trade programs for  weve obviously anticipated that there might be changes and i think we are well positioned to compete there but we havent observed a lot yet to answer your question directly christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then i had just a followup to matts question on vapor kind of twopronged question one being that markten xl is expanding beyond its lead categories does that mean its going national will we see this across the country or is it just a slow methodical build from here and maybe related to that then how your promotional tactic has changed in the category just given the category slowed and were lapping the initial launch of the product last year are you changing your promotional tactic now and maybe focusing more so on profitability than on pure trial of the product martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah the answer to both questions the word i would use is disciplined the way that we are going we are very happy with how markten xl is performing we were in lead markets as you know and then weve had a terrific consumer response there so what we are going to do is with discipline we are going to roll it out into some additional lead markets through select accounts and learn more and try to get wider awareness and distribution of markten xl we are very encouraged about the consumer response to markten so well do that in a disciplined way i would say in promotions its the same thing we have to get the product right you have to listen to the consumer you want to build awareness and trial but you certainly dont want to overspend particularly i might note in a category where the growth has slowed so well be very disciplined how we do that but its a place where we want to play our aspiration is ultimately for leadership but this is emerging an emerging product category and we want to do it with a lot of financial discipline christopher growe  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you for the time martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks for calling chris operator our next question comes from the line of todd duvick with wells fargo todd duvick  wells fargo securities llc yes good morning quick question for you on the balance sheet ive noticed your debt has been going down the last couple of years and your leverage is in really good shape oneandahalf times but it is also declining can you talk about are you wanting additional capacity on the balance sheet for something like share buyback or acquisitions or is this a change in financial policy in just deciding to operate at a lower leverage level martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah thanks for the question when we look at the balance sheet and kind of our debt levels we feel like we are in a good range currently where we are at but we are always assessing the financing needs of the enterprise then when we make that decision that we want to go to the market we look at market conditions and other factors to decide when well go but no there is no change in our financial strategies there or policies and we feel good about where we are at todd duvick  wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess just related to the anheuserbusch sab transaction i think that you would be due some cash in the door from that transaction any ideas as to potentially use of those proceeds martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer i think it is too early for us to be talking about that as i mentioned in our remarks i just dont want to get ahead of a deal that has not been announced as to its final terms if you can forgive us well just hold off on that until that happens todd duvick  wells fargo securities llc fair enough thank you martin j barrington  chairman president  chief executive officer okay thanks for calling in operator thank you at this time id like to turn the call back over to sarah knakmuhs for closing remarks sarah fitzgerald knakmuhs  vice president investor relations thank you everyone for joining the call this
