credit ken wolter  shutterstock shares october   dr charles m geschke  john e warnockcofounders of adobe systems incfounded our only real cleverness was in the perception of what was happening and in being quick enough on our feet to take advantage of ifdr charles m geschke mention the names bill gates and steve jobs and most people immediately know whom youre talking about but mention the names dr charles m geschke and john e warnock and chances are youll be met with blank stares ironically these two publicityshy hightech trailblazers played major roles in the success of both microsoft and apple in fact without the postscript language created by the company geschke and warnock cofounded adobe systems inc desktop publishing as we know it wouldnt existlike many silicon valley firms adobe was a spinoff of a bigger companyin this case xerox corp geschke and warnock first met and began working together at xeroxs palo alto research center parc where they helped develop xeroxs pagedescription language interpress the language won accolades within the corporation but to geschke and warnocks dismay xerox decided to keep the technology proprietary rather that release it to public domain geschke and warnock were flabbergasted by the decision as geschke explains in a  pc week interview we didnt see how you could make an industrywide standard with something that was proprietarydeciding that they could get old and gray and frustrated somewhere else and have more fun geschke and warnock left parc to found adobe systems inc in late  originally they planned to build a copyservice business but quickly abandoned the idea next they considered offering a complete turnkey system for office printing but dismissed that idea as well when they realized that the industry would probably head in a different directionfinally they decided to concentrate on what they did bestdeveloping specialized printing software the result of this decision was the adobe postscript pagedescription language a revolutionary breakthrough in printing technology postscript was the first printing software that enabled users to print pages that included text line art and digitized photosrealizing that their best chance for success lay in making postscript an industry standard adobe quickly made the postscript language public domain but if the product was public domain and therefore free how could adobe make money from its new software simple without the postscript program that interprets the postscript language the language itself is useless in a unique twist on the classic sell them the razor cheap then make your profits on supplying the blades adobe would make its money from selling the postscript interpreter which executes page descriptions generated by other software packages such as desktop publishing and word processing programs in addition the company would also provide original equipment manufacturers oems with designs for interpreter boards to be used in their printersthe strategy worked by the end of their first year in business geschke and warnock had licensed postscript to apple computer inc which in turn introduced the first postscriptbased laser printer the apple laserwriter in january  and thus the postscript laser printer industry was bornthanks to what geschke has described as a unique combination of forward thinking marketing savvy timing and luck adobe was a success almost from the very start by the end of  it was posting revenue of  million which grew to  million by the beginning of  based on their rapidly increasing revenue geschke and warnock made an initial public offering in august  and adobe stock immediately became one of wall streets darlings it rocketed from  to a peak of  in may  which in reality was a  peak considering and earlier for stock splitbut more important by  adobes postscript had become the industrystandard printer language more than  thirdparty software programs supported postscript and adobe boasted licensing agreements with  printer companies including ibm digital ast and texas instruments even hewlettpackard which had initially refused to endorse the language in any way was forced to adopt postscript to further increase postscripts popularity adobe began building what would eventually become the worlds largest typeface librarywith postscript firmly entrenched as the industry standard geschke and warnock branched out into the enduser software market with the release of adobe illustrator in march  this highend graphic package for professional artists and illustrators was an instant hit with both users and criticsby  illustrator had also become an industry standard adobes second software program photoshop another professional graphics package that enables users to manipulate both blackandwhite and color photographs was generating impressive reviews and even more impressive sales and adobes typeface library had grown to include  fontsflush with this success geschke and warnock set their sights on a new goal creating a paperless office to this end they developed adobe acrobat an innovative program that enables users to create documents that others can view regardless of their application software in a brilliant marketing move adobe decided to offer acrobat reader the program needed to view acrobat documents free of charge instead they would charge for acrobat distiller the program that creates acrobat documents although its not the raging success postscript or illustrator were acrobat is widely used for transferring sharing and viewing documents electronicallythe duos next big move was to join forces with aldus corp the creator of the popular desktop publishing program pagemaker in  the merger handed adobe unquestioned leadership of the publishingsoftware market creating one vendor with a broad array of products that covers both windows and macintosh usersadobes position as king of the hill would not go unchallenged however by  the once undisputed ruler of desktop publishing was losing market share to quark corpwhose quark xpress desktop publishing program had muscled pagemaker out of the top spot in the macintosh marketand corel corp whose coreldraw was gaining ground on illustrator in the windows marketrather than go toetotoe with these two upandcoming contenders geschke and warnock decided to change the rules on their competitors they attempted to reposition adobe as a highprofile world wide web publisher with the release of two webpage authoring tools pagemill and sitemill they also retooled illustrator pagemaker and photoshop to include webcontent creation tools the gambit proved worthwhile as adobe once again became the kingpin of the professional graphics market averaging nearly  million in sales in by  adobe found itself competing with a new more powerful challengersoftware titan microsoft before microsofts emergence in the imageediting market many industry analysts had noticed a change in adobe while it was still producing innovative products sales were down mostly because its marketing and pr efforts seemed to stall pc magazine columnist john c dvorak suggests that was partially due to the continually increasing isolation of both geschke and warnock which dvorak proposes was caused by geschkes abduction by terrorists in whatever the future may hold for geschke and warnock one thing is certainadobes influence on the computer industry and image editing will be apparent for decades to come whether you browse the world wide web flip through a magazine or newspaper pick up a product box or look up at a billboard chances are the images and text were created with one or more adobe products five days of terroron may   an event occurred that would rock silicon valley on his way to adobes headquarters in mountain view california charles geschke was abducted by two kidnappers who demanded  in ransom for his return geschkes family was instructed to put the ransom in a knapsack and drop it off at an isolated beach fbi agents hiding nearby lost one of the kidnappers in the fog as he was picking up the ransom but captured him several hours later during questioning the kidnapper revealed the location where geschke was being held and geschke was returned to his family after five days in captivitybook wormin what very well may be one of the computer

countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and

exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical

password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos

hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new

countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and

exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswires customers which has been tied to the adobe security

mediacorp canada inc and was featured in macleans newsmagazine criticismsedit pricingedit adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being up to twice as much in nonus countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by  users in june  adobe further increased its prices in the uk by  in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar and uk users are not allowed to buy from the us store adobe ranked no  on a list of internet’s  most hated companies based on a  survey on redditcom adobes reader and flash were listed on the  most hated programs of all time on techradarcom securityedit hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswires customers which has been tied to the adobe security breachcitation needed they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state court and expose up to  social security numbers see also adobe creative cloud § criticism anticompetitive practicesedit adobe acquired aldus corp in  a software vendor that sold freehand a competing product freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator adobes flagship vectorgraphics editor the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next  years  altsys was then bought by macromedia which released versions  to  when adobe acquired macromedia in december  it stalled development of freehand in  effectively rendering it obsolete with freehand and illustrator adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems in  a group of  freehand graphic designers convened under the banner free freehand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe the suit alleged that adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand the dominant competitor to adobe’s illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an opensource community if it cannot update it internally as of  on its freehand product page adobe stated while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs software which supports both powerpc and intelbased macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista as of  the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page adobes software ftp server still contains a directory

mediacorp canada inc and was featured in macleans newsmagazine criticismsedit pricingedit adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being up to twice as much in nonus countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by  users in june  adobe further increased its prices in the uk by  in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar and uk users are not allowed to buy from the us store adobe ranked no  on a list of internet’s  most hated companies based on a  survey on redditcom adobes reader and flash were listed on the  most hated programs of all time on techradarcom securityedit hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswires customers which has been tied to the adobe security breachcitation needed they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state court and expose up to  social security numbers see also adobe creative cloud § criticism anticompetitive practicesedit adobe acquired aldus corp in  a software vendor that sold freehand a competing product freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator adobes flagship vectorgraphics editor the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next  years  altsys was then bought by macromedia which released versions  to  when adobe acquired macromedia in december  it stalled development of freehand in  effectively rendering it obsolete with freehand and illustrator adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems in  a group of  freehand graphic designers convened under the banner free freehand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe the suit alleged that adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand the dominant competitor to adobe’s illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an opensource community if it cannot update it internally as of  on its freehand product page adobe stated while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs software which supports both powerpc and intelbased macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista as of  the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page adobes software ftp server still contains a directory

mediacorp canada inc and was featured in macleans newsmagazine criticismsedit pricingedit adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices with retail prices being up to twice as much in nonus countries as pointed out by many it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the united states and purchase one particular collection of adobes software there than to buy it locally in australia after adobe revealed the pricing for the creative suite  master collection which was £ higher for european customers a petition to protest over unfair pricing was published and signed by  users in june  adobe further increased its prices in the uk by  in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar and uk users are not allowed to buy from the us store adobe ranked no  on a list of internet’s  most hated companies based on a  survey on redditcom adobes reader and flash were listed on the  most hated programs of all time on techradarcom securityedit hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in adobe programs such as adobe reader to gain unauthorized access to computers adobes flash player has also been criticized for among other things suffering from performance memory usage and security problems see criticism of flash player a report by security researchers from kaspersky lab criticized adobe for producing the products having top  security vulnerabilities observers noted that adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the creative suite  software and quietly sending user data to a firm named omniture when users became aware adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account when a security flaw was later discovered in photoshop cs adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade following a fierce backlash adobe decided to provide the software patch adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including thirdparty browser toolbars and free virus scanners usually as part of the flash update process and for pushing a thirdparty scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs customer data breachedit on october   the company initially revealed that  million customers sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information adobe later admitted that  million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their ids and encrypted passwords as well as to many inactive adobe accounts the company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted such as email addresses and physical addresses though data privacy laws in  states require this information to be encrypted a  gb file stolen from adobe and containing  million usernames reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on anonnewsorg lastpass a password security firm said that adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them another security firm sophos showed that adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort according to an it expert simon bain adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’ many of the credit cards were tied to the creative cloud softwarebysubscription service adobe offered its affected us customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service but no similar arrangements have been made for nonus customers when a data breach occurs in the us penalties depend on the state where the victim resides not where the company is based after stealing the customers data cyberthieves also accessed adobes source code repository likely in midaugust  because hackers acquired copies of the source code of adobe proprietary products they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security computer experts warned security researcher alex holden chief information security officer of hold security characterized this adobe breach which affected acrobat coldfusion and numerous other applications as one of the worst in us history adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of photoshop which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate adobes expensive products published on a server of a russianspeaking hacker group the disclosure of encryption algorithms other security schemes and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data and may have opened the gateway to new generation zeroday attacks hackers already used coldfusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of pr newswires customers which has been tied to the adobe security breachcitation needed they also used a coldfusion exploit to breach washington state court and expose up to  social security numbers see also adobe creative cloud § criticism anticompetitive practicesedit adobe acquired aldus corp in  a software vendor that sold freehand a competing product freehand was direct competition to adobe illustrator adobes flagship vectorgraphics editor the federal trade commission intervened and forced adobe to sell freehand back to altsys and also banned adobe from buying back freehand or any similar program for the next  years  altsys was then bought by macromedia which released versions  to  when adobe acquired macromedia in december  it stalled development of freehand in  effectively rendering it obsolete with freehand and illustrator adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for macintosh operating systems in  a group of  freehand graphic designers convened under the banner free freehand and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california against adobe the suit alleged that adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anticompetitive acts and strategies designed to kill freehand the dominant competitor to adobe’s illustrator software product instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled the freehand community believes adobe should release the product to an opensource community if it cannot update it internally as of  on its freehand product page adobe stated while we recognize freehand has a loyal customer base we encourage users to migrate to the new adobe illustrator cs software which supports both powerpc and intelbased macs and microsoft windows xp and windows vista as of  the freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the illustrator page adobes software ftp server still contains a directory

consumer can engage in extremely robust highquality desktop publishing can be credited largely to the work of john warnock and charles “chuck” geschke who founded adobe systems inc in  to deliver the programming language known as postscript to printer and computing device makers warnock and geschke first met while working for the research organization xerox parc palo alto research center where warnock under the direction of geschke developed a language dubbed “interpress” to enable xerox printers to talk to computers the pair’s mutual frustration with xerox parc’s unwillingness to commercialize the software inspired them to strike out on their own today adobe is arguably the most important firm in desktop publishing software worldwide and is worth nearly  billion warnock was born on oct   in salt lake city utah he attended the university of utah where he earned bs degrees in mathematics and philosophy an ms in mathematics and a phd in engineering and computer science he joined ibm corp while pursuing his doctoral degree and then left planning to complete his education and become a professor a job in the computer center at utah inspired in him a love of technology and an interest in the burgeoning personal computing industry he worked for a time for evans  sutherland computer corp and computer sciences corp before he accepted a post in graphics research at xerox parc geschke was the man who hired him cleveland ohio native geschke was born on september   he earned a ba in classics and an ms in mathematics at xavier university followed by a phd in computer science from carnegie mellon in  he joined xerox parc shortly after graduation there he helped design the mesa programming language and was charged in  with forming a new laboratory focused on graphics and imaging research he formed the imaging sciences laboratory where he led the development of interpress a deviceagnostic printing protocol working closely with warnock at that time personal computing devices were beginning to come to the marketplace for the first time printers were being developed but these were of the dotmatrix variety which produced results with extremely poor quality printing from computers was typically done using typesetting machines that cost upwards of  and production was laborintensive while xerox made interpress its internal standard the firm was not interested in licensing the technology to others warnock and geschke believed that this was a tremendous missedopportunity they resigned from xerox parc in  and created a new language from scratch to enable computers to communicate to printers exactly how text images and lines should appear on paper they named their firm after a creek that ran behind warnock’s home their original plan was to start a service business where they would provide printing services to businesses and consumers encouraged by their financial advisors they moved toward a software development model and focused on making postscript truly portable based on warnock’s innovative algorithm for “hidden surface determination in computer graphics” they caught the attention of steve jobs and apple computer which bought a  percent stake in adobe and agreed to use postscript in its laserwriter printer that printer hit the market in  a year later texas instruments released ibmcompatible pcs equipped with the postscript protocol adobe held its initial public offering in  by  it had grown to an  million company adobe expanded its offerings adding illustrator design software in  acrobat in  and later photoshop and premiere the company also created the acrobat portable document format pdf which made it possible to transfer files between incompatible systems and keep the look consistent adobe remains an industry standard setter and continues to update and add to its product line warnock held the position of chairman ceo and chief technical officer of adobe systems until  he holds six patents and has been honored with numerous awards for his work including the acm systems award the bodleian medal and many others he is also a fellow of the association for computing machinery geschke held the post of president of adobe until  his long list of awards includes the john w gardner leadership award and with warnock the  american electronics association’s medal of achievement in  they both received the national medal of technology and innovation one of the most prestigious awards given to scientists engineers and inventors today geshcke and warnock continue to serve as cochairmen of the board at

leadership content in  adobe systems marked its th anniversary a relatively long tenure for a company that sells personal computer software an industry barely more than  years old surviving so long in this rapidlychanging business has required a certain nimbleness adobe’s products — and its business models — have evolved as computing moved from standalone pcs to the global communications network of the internet and worldwide web but behind these changing technologies is a consistent set of business principles established by adobe’s two cofounders and current cochairmen charles m chuck geschke and john warnock computer scientists who originally worked together at xerox’s storied palo alto research center parc geschke and warnock founded adobe systems in  to commercialize their ideas for electronic document production the company’s first product postscript was a computer language for describing printed pages that adobe sold to printer manufacturers this largely behindthescenes technology built into printers set the stage for the desktop publishing revolution of the late s one key to postscript’s success was its sophisticated technology for rendering digital typefaces adobe’s font business moved the company into the retail software market its software business expanded when the company developed adobe illustrator a drawing program to allow graphic artists to take advantage of postscript’s rich imaging features photoshop another imaging program for editing photographs and other “bitmapped” images was licensed from brothers thomas and john knoll in  in june  adobe shipped the first version of its acrobat software for creating and viewing electronic documents acrobat was slow to catch on initially but once the reader software required to view acrobat’s pdf documents — originally priced at  per user — was distributed without charge the technology began to gain traction with users with the rise of the web pdf became a de facto standard for distributing richly formatted electronic documents the desire to support rich content on the web also motivated adobe’s acquisition of macromedia in  when knowledgewharton asked then ceo bruce chizen about the primary motivation behind the deal his oneword response was “flash” with postscript pdf and flash adobe established core standards that laid the foundation for desktop publishing electronic document interchange and interactive web content with the company’s air adobe integrated runtime platform adobe hopes to have a similar impact on the development of the next generation of webconnected software knowledgewharton recently met with adobe systems’ cofounder and cochairman charles geschke near his home in los altos calif in this edited version of that interview the yearold geschke discusses how adobe systems was born and how the company’s business plans and its product portfolio have continued to evolve knowledgewharton do you recall when you first met john warnock geschke very well working at xerox’s parc i’d just put on a demonstration of what the future office could be like for xerox senior management in boca raton florida it was a big deal we did a stage production that was scripted and set up in hollywood this was the body language of essentially every xerox executive looking at all this stuff folds his arms and tenses up it was pretty clear to me that we were fighting a tough battle but i was committed when i got back i was given the opportunity to start a new lab focused on graphics electronic printing and some other stuff first i needed to find a chief scientist i didn’t want to recruit somebody from inside parc because i wanted some fresh ideas i’d known john by reputation but i’d never actually met him i called him up and said “i’d like to talk to you about some interesting things i’m doing” we met for lunch he had a beard and i had a beard he had three kids two boys and one girl i had two boys and one girl he refereed soccer and so did i he was a mathematician i was originally a mathematician by training we hit it off and i hired him it was the best hiring decision i ever made knowledgewharton what prompted you and warnock to leave xerox xerox loved what we had done they said “we’ll make it a corporate standard” i said “great” i went to connecticut to xerox headquarters and said “i’m here to talk about the marketing plan for rolling this out” they said “oh wait a minute at xerox it takes seven years to develop a product — and we can’t talk about this because other people will get the idea and beat us to market” i said “seven years in the industry you’re about to go into that’s two to three generations by the time you bring it out it will be worthless” they said “sorry it takes seven years at xerox” john and i were frustrated it turned out that his thesis adviser at the university of utah was on the board of the investment bank hambrecht  quist bill hambrechtwas one of the first guys pushing venture investing in hightech companies we told him our plan which was to build a complete turnkey publishing system — the computers the printers the typesetting equipment everything — and sell it to the fortune  so they could bring a lot of their production work in house he liked the idea because he hated financial printers every time he did a prospectus he felt that he was being robbed he agreed to invest  million over two years in two equal payments and told us we would have to quit our jobs — which was a little bit of a gut wrench although we knew with our backgrounds we could get a job in silicon valley pretty easily so we opened our doors and began recruiting people knowledgewharton if your original plan was to sell complete turnkey publishing systems why did you switch to just marketing postscript printer software geschke one of my professors from carnegie mellon gordon bell had left carnegie to become the head of rd for digital equipment corporation after about two months he came by to see what we were doing we showed him what we were involved in and described our business plan he said “wow that looks very cool and it solves a problem i’m having but of course i don’t need any computers — i’m digital equipment and i’ve got a deal with ricoh for the printer so i don’t need that but i have two or three development teams that are failing miserably at figuring out how to interface them together that’s what you guys are doing as part of your solution why don’t you just sell me that software” we said “well gordon we’ve got this business plan that raised  million dollars we have to do that” he said “well if you change your mind call me” in about two more months a friend of ours who had left xerox to work for steve jobs on the macintosh brought steve over we showed steve what we were doing and he said “wow but i don’t need the computers i’ve got this macintosh in development” which he showed us “i have a deal with canon for the laser printer so i don’t need that” he said “but my development guys are getting nowhere with this software sell me your company come work for me and i’ll put it in my product” knowledgewharton did you actually consider selling the entire company to apple geschke no not really we heard him we were polite but we said “you know steve we really want to start our own company” and he said “oh all right i can understand that so sell me the software” we said “we have this business plan that raised  million” he said “i think you guys are nuts you’ll change your mind when you do call me” so we talked to the chairman of our board qt wiles whom bill put in as sort of a fatherly figure to advise us he said “jobs is right — you’re nuts that business plan was only there to get you the money your customers are telling you what your business ought to be throw the business plan out and do a deal” i called up steve hat in hand and said “we changed our mind we would like to arrange a deal to license you the software” he said “how much do you want for the company” we said “we’re not for sale steve” he said “oh all right” so we worked a deal with him he bought  of adobe systems as part of the deal which was a x multiple on the original venture investment and we did a deal with a prepayment of future royalties altogether we brought in about  million so our second round of venture investment did not come in as a tax preferred investment they just bought stock with it knowledgewharton this is how adobe began as a printer software company geschke yes we developed the postscript language after we left parc what really caught people’s attention was what we were doing in terms of rendering type onthefly from outlines the curves used to define the characters of a typeface at any size or angle popular mythology at the time said that couldn’t be done you have to hire a bunch of monks to build bitmaps we knew that wouldn’t fly because we really wanted to do arbitrary expansion and contraction of the typefaces you could never have enough bitmaps or enough typefaces to satisfy the printing world it was just infeasible you had to do it from outlines we eventually developed software that did that and continue to use it today we built our own outline type business at the same time we were the first to be licensed the trademarks “times” and “helvetica” by the linotype corporation knowledgewharton was that hard to convince a traditional font company like linotype to go into digital type this was very different from the business they were in selling fonts for traditional typesetting equipment geschke oh yeah they had a lock on the customers who bought their type if you decided to get rid of them and go to agfa or compugraphic it was a big deal because nobody’s equipment was compatible we went to compugraphic first because they were an american company and we thought that would be easier they were very arrogant they had the lion’s share of the market at the time linotype needed an edge up and so they agreed to do business with us within about two years they had the lion’s share of the business in the united states because they had postscript compatibility compugraphic had to sell itself to agfa and basically went out of business knowledgewharton by the time you developed your actual business plan you had apple as a partner geschke and linotype ibm came to talk to us but we deliberately decided to go really slow we figured that in order to get a decent deal with them we had to have leverage — namely a competitor already doing well we tried to do a deal with hp hewlettpackard they were extremely arrogant because the hewlettpackard laserjet was doing very well and they didn’t want to talk to us after the apple laserwriter and desktop publishing became a phenomenon ibm decided they had to get into the game and we did a deal with them as soon as we announced the ibm deal then hewlettpackard called and said “we think we need to do business” knowledgewharton when did you enter the japanese market geschke we licensed type technology for the japanese market in  or  it was almost the identical situation as with compugraphic and linotype originally the japanese typesetting industry had only one company before world war ii the two guys who ran it got into a disagreement over the japanese conduct of going to war one guy was a supporter of the war effort and the other was not so they split the business one guy stayed in tokyo and his business took off because he was at the seat of power and the other guy took his part of the business to osaka he did okay but he was struggling we first went to the tokyo branch at that point it was run by a woman which was quite unusual in japanese industry she was the widow of the fellow who had stayed in tokyo i could never get to the second cup of tea with her she just didn’t want to talk she had  of the business and she didn’t need anything newfangled so we went to osaka and talked to the other company and again because they wanted to get into a stronger position and they intuitively knew the industry was going to change we did a deal with them we got the license to their type library and they now have  to  of the business knowledgewharton as was the case with linotype the incumbent wasn’t interested but the underdog was and it completely changed the fortunes of both companies geschke i think if you did a study of business deals it’s almost always that way the companies that think they’re in control of their longterm destiny don’t want to talk to a young startup company that’s going to change the rules of the business knowledgewharton from the beginning you documented the specification for the postscript language geschke yes we published the spec about three or four months before the first laserwriter shipped knowledgewharton these days this is fairly common practice to help establish a standard platform but it was much less common back then was this merely a practical necessity because people needed to write software to drive postscript printers or was this a strategic move to establish postscript as a standard geschke it wasn’t strategic in the sense that we understood this would become a standard way of doing business it was the only way we could figure out to get the hardware manufacturers and the software developers and the platform vendors to collaborate you couldn’t do independent deals with each of them because there would always be somebody left out if you really wanted to make it a standard — and our goal from the beginning was to have it be a universal standard — you have to publish you just have no choice you’re taking the risk that someone will do a better job of implementing it we had the self confidence that we would always have the best implementation and that has turned out to be true knowledgewharton a lot of postscript clones did come along eventually geschke at one time there were over  of them knowledgewharton high school knowledgewharton did it ever worry you that they would start to chip away at your market share geschke no but it turned out that microsoft acquired one of them knowledgewharton from bauer enterprises geschke right trueimage they called it microsoft did a deal to license trueimage to appleand apple would license truetype to microsoft that was pretty scary for us knowledgewharton when did you first hear about the microsoftapple partnership for trueimage and truetype geschke a few days before it was announced knowledgewharton this was announced at the seybold publishing systems conference in september  you heard about it a couple days prior to that geschke the preceding friday i had a conversation with bill gates knowledgewharton did gates call you geschke no we were trying to close a deal we were hoping to license him atm adobe type manager which was adobe’s version of truetype for onscreen font display the deal we offered microsoft was already running technology ready to ship in a matter of weeks all the type libraries already licensed all of the agreements in place and we were not going to charge them it was free knowledgewharton how could he say no geschke that’s what i asked bill and i’m not going to tell you the answer knowledgewharton but he told you in that phone call that he was going a different way and was going to do a deal with apple to license its font technology geschke yes it’s why he was going a different way that i’m not going to tell you knowledgewharton presumably it was a control issue — he didn’t want the control of that core technology in the hands of an independent company geschke let’s leave it at that let’s move on knowledgewharton okay what was the response to the applemicrosoft announcement at that seybold conference geschke i think if you were to talk to adobe customers in any era one of the things they’ll tell you is that while they may have a disagreement about this or that by and large they were treated fairly they could depend upon getting great technology licensed to them on a fair and equitable basis customers like that if you treat them the way you like to be treated they sense that that was always part of our core philosophy as a company at that seybold conference when the announcement was made between apple and microsoft the seybold people immediately changed the schedule to put a panel on the last day to discuss all of this before the panel began the moderator got up and said “i want to take a straw vote i want everyone to raise their hand who thinks they would rather have apple and microsoft take over this segment of the business” there were a few hands raised — i’ve always believed they were microsoft and apple people — but basically no one voted against us they all wanted adobe to continue to be their vendor we brought atm out within about  days and sold hundreds of thousands of units in the first quarter which was a lot in those days it was three years before apple and microsoft shipped truetype knowledgewharton and trueimage really never got out of the starting gate geschke no it never got anywhere apple tried to build one product on it they eventually gave up called us and said “will you come back” knowledgewharton how was it to go from being a company that sold printer software to oems original equipment manufacturers to being a shrinkwrapped desktop software company with products like illustrator and photoshop geschke it was a “come to jesus” moment inside the company because all the profits were being made by postscript as we began to invest in not only development which was relatively inexpensive — just a few people — but more importantly in building a sales and marketing presence in the retail channel we were chewing up resources it was difficult in the early days to demonstrate profitability in that business every time we would have a budget debate you can imagine how that went “i’m bringing in most of the money i should be getting these resources” knowledgewharton what motivated you to stick with this second line of business geschke one of the obvious lessons in business is that you can’t continue to be a one product company and survive we also felt we couldn’t be a one channel company and survive we were captive of those oems of postscript printers if they ever decided to drop us we would have been toast we had no channel in fact one of the things that we did to try to get hp’s attention — the hewlettpackard laserjet had cartridges to add features to the printer we built a device to convert a laserjet into a postscript printer and sold it at retail as a laserjet cartridge so we already knew we were going to a retail sales channel the other thing that was happening is that the software applications in those days on dos — windows wasn’t even there yet — and the macintosh weren’t using more than  of the capability inside a postscript printer in fact our own graphic designers at adobe had to learn how to program in postscript to do graphics we knew that wasn’t going to fly john’s wife was — and is — a graphic designer john had a second job when he went home at night writing postscript code to do what she wanted to do on the laserwriter he got a couple of engineers to come up with illustrator we launched illustrator and it did very well we realized then that we spent a lot of money to build a retail channel and a sales force and we had to feed it there had to be more products knowledgewharton that led to photoshop geschke a couple guys from the university of michigan — the knoll brothers — came out to california and showed us this thing they were working on for manipulating photographs john and i couldn’t figure out if there would ever be much of a market but it looked like a pretty good idea by that time it was obvious that the printing industry was going to go completely digital with our technology — and that the same would be true in all imaging dimensions it should be true in photography it should be true in video why wouldn’t all imagery be digital so we decided to buy the twoman company and hire the guys we did a royalty deal with them so we could keep the price reasonable when we made that decision there were no digital cameras a scanner was about the size of a refrigerator and cost  to  a power user on a macintosh had this little black and white display with an extra disk that held maybe  megabytes and we are bringing out a product that was going to push all those dimensions right off the map we instinctively knew that was where things were going the only business book that john and i ever read and the only chapter that i remember from it was a chapter entitled “market gap analysis” the one idea i remember was that it is easier to build a business if you find a new solution to an already perceived problem that no one has come out with before — because you instantly are at  market share we did that with postscript we did that with illustrator and we were going to do it with photoshop even though we knew we were going in early and it has worked out very well we did the same thing with acrobat we brought acrobat out about three years before the internet really took off thinking that local area networking would be enough to support it but it wasn’t and we’re trying to do the same thing with air the adobe integrated runtime development platform for crossoperating system software bring it out before anyone else has the idea of the concept get the platform established and then shame on us if we can’t make money off it knowledgewharton while the technology has changed greatly over the past two decades there appears to be a certain consistency in adobe’s business strategy geschke that’s one of the things that contrasts us with microsoft they have never invented anything that i am aware of they clone someone else’s idea and use their market position to try and force their way into the business tell me a new market innovation they opened up windows came from parc word came from parc excel came from lotus powerpoint came from aldus persuasion and they can’t take credit for email knowledgewharton you mentioned that acrobat was a product that was different than anything that had come before what was the initial insight that led to the development of acrobat and pdf geschke we had already in effect converted anything that went to physical media into digital form paper is a great way to read information but it’s not a very effective way to store it it’s a very expensive way to ship it and it’s very hard to search but a digital representation of the page doesn’t have any of those problems it’s very cheap to store — you can store the entire world knowledge in a couple of filing cabinets you can ship electronic information and let the recipient decide how they want to read it — on a screen on paper or on film and searching it is much more efficient it came out of that idea if everything that matters goes through our postscript printer driver we can just capture it at the printing point and turn it into this electronic form knowledgewharton initially acrobat reader  wasn’t free — it had a retail price of  per seat with acrobat  the reader became free was that decision difficult internally for you to make geschke oh yeah the concept of giving away software was anathema a very foreign concept but it became obvious that doing that was the only way we could get market penetration microsoft could assume that somehow or another everybody had word we couldn’t assume that everyone was going to buy the reader knowledgewharton for a long time it cost adobe more to develop and market acrobat than the revenue it returned geschke oh yeah the antibodies inside the company were just all over it knowledgewharton people wanted to kill the product geschke of course because they said “look we’re selling all this photoshop we’re selling all these printers why the hell are we investing in this thing and giving it away” knowledgewharton why did you continue to invest in acrobat for so long what gave you the confidence to continue to pour money into it geschke your own instincts you can’t analyze a market that has never existed when people were analyzing whether to invest in the haloid company which was the precursor of xerox they went out and measured the carbon paper market and they said “it’s not very big and it’s not growing very much” they were measuring the wrong thing knowledgewharton adobe is a publicly held company would the current market let you run that long with a product that was costing you more than the revenue it was generating geschke as long as we were making a lot of money on everything else they never knew the trick is to be very aggressive in other parts of your business and if you’re lucky enough to get a “franchise” product like photoshop you can’t become complacent for example when we brought out photodeluxe we were initially the strongest competitor for photoshop rather than cede the low end of the market to someone else we took it and that allowed us to upgrade people with hindsight it was the exactly the right thing to do — not give someone the ability to undercut you come in and be “good enough” we learned that from the laserjet although a postscript printer like the laserwriter was a much better product eventually the hewlettpackard laserjet was good enough although postscript is still a profitable business knowledgewharton even with all the postscript clones geschke and the fact that all the money is in the ink there is no money in the printers anymore do you know who today is our biggest customer for desktop printing xerox i own two xerox printers now both of which have postscript one’s black and white and one’s color so whatever goes around comes around knowledgewharton in the summer of  adobe systems went through a difficult period the stock price was depressed quark one of your leading competitors in the page layout business attempted a hostile takeover what caused that situation geschke a year or two earlier i walked into john warnock’s office and said “john i think i don’t want to work at a fulltime job in a year that begins with the numeral  it just doesn’t seem right” he said “what are you telling me” i said “i’m telling you we’re both getting pretty close to ” i was flying a quarter of a million miles a year i said “i just don’t think it’s good for me to keep doing this because if i can’t do it full out like i always have i won’t feel good about it and i don’t think i’ll be good for the company we really need to think about what to do” we have always been highly leveraged — our revenue per employee has always been high as a result we kept a pretty lean organization with a pretty shallow management structure we frankly hadn’t done work trying to groom anybody as a successor because we weren’t thinking about it so — this was not our brightest decision — we decided we could recruit replacement talent spend a couple of years with them get them up to speed and their natural abilities would take over we hired three or four very bright people people who were very successful in their previous businesses and had the right pedigree to run a business like adobe we figured we would meld them into a team well each one of them thought that he should be the future ceo of the company rather than melding as a team they fought like cats it became miserable it was impossible to have a staff meeting without it breaking out into angry disputes it was getting ugly because of people trying to build turf spending was getting ahead of revenue and in the summer of  the japanese market went off a cliff for six months it just stopped i’ve never fully understood why it happened and we found ourselves having to preannounce a very bad quarter and dealing with these people who weren’t getting along john and i decided that we would fire all of them on the same day we identified the person — bruce chizen — we wanted to groom from the inside we decided to just gut it out — announce the bad quarter and go back to our knitting after we announced all that we got the hostile takeover letter and that became public immediately this was the second time that we had to go to a seybold conference and deal with a very awkward moment in our history because our crack marketing people were so divisive internally we didn’t have a keynote position in that conference we talked to steve jobs who had come back to apple we showed him indesign adobe’s page layout software running on a mac and said “we’d like to talk about this can you give us some of your time” he said “sure” we went up on stage showed indesign and people loved what they saw because they could see the postscript imaging model coming right up on the display which is something steve always wanted to ship on the macintosh but when he left and jeanlouis gassée came in gassée squelched that the audience loved it on the last day they had another one of those panels where they polled the audience to see who supported a quark acquisition of adobe i don’t know how much you know about quark but their customers have a lot of difficulty with them this time there wasn’t a single hand raised in the room when the question was asked and we now have market leadership in that market it’s the only time we’ve ever dislodged an entrenched competitor we were ticked off and fortunately we built a superior product knowledgewharton as part of this management change of all the executives in the company why did you look to bruce chizen geschke he had a sales and marketing background he had worked for a while for microsoft and at claris a software company started by apple computer he was actually being hired by aldus the week that we announced the acquisition then aldus president paul brainerd and i went to the san francisco airport paul introduced me to bruce and i convinced him to stay even though his job was going to be different we didn’t know how it would be different shortly after the merger we changed what he would do he’s the guy who brought out photodeluxe we watched him bring out a product launch it and build a new category for adobe software as a result we had a lot of respect for his abilities and gave him higherpower jobs by  he was running all of our application products business he seemed like the natural candidate to groom we did that for a couple of years and when i announced my retirement we moved him in as the president about six months later john decided he didn’t want to work anymore and then chizen became the ceo bruce did an incredible job and stepped down in december  fortunately we didn’t repeat the mistake we had been grooming current ceo shantanu narayen for several years to move in that position “we’ll find another person to groom so that when shantanu steps down we’ll do it again” knowledgewharton the issue of succession seems to be a challenge for many technology companies apple is very centered on steve jobs oracle is very larry ellison centric geschke it’s hard if you want to give real value to your shareholders and build a company that has a long life you realize pretty quickly that that is a major problem and you’ve got to start working on it we should have been brighter and known that we couldn’t go outside you have to do it from the inside i have always believed that the principles and values of the company you build is an important ingredient in its success you can’t get someone to come in from the outside and just pick that up in a sixmonth training period it doesn’t work that way not everybody agrees with some of those principles — they think they have to do it a different way knowledgewharton it seems like you’ve tried to maintain the consistency of adobe’s corporate culture even as the company’s technology focus has evolved geschke we really didn’t start emphasizing corporate culture until roughly  when we began john and i wanted to build a company that we would like to work in why would you build a business you didn’t want to work in we both had enough experience that we knew there were a lot of things we felt we shouldn’t do and had some ideas about things that we thought were important to do but we didn’t really start verbalizing it until it became clear that as we got bigger and we had to confront tough things we needed to make sure that everybody understood and could help us enunciate what those principles were what that culture was about and make this ingrained in how the business ran so i started at least once a year giving talks on the whole thing in  i wrote a sixpage memo and distributed it to the whole company about not only what the background cultural ideas were but some of the things that we had started to do that were deviating from good principles of how the business would run when new employees come in they’re still getting a session at employee indoctrination to give them that background so that they understand the kind of company they are coming to work for knowledgewharton what were some of the key points in the memo you sent to the employees geschke i talked about the fact that we were having way too many meetings that were too large if you have a decisionmaking meeting you can only have four or five people in the room if you have a communication meeting be careful whether you even need to have it there are lots of ways to communicate you don’t need to bring all the people physically into one place mundane stuff like that treat the company’s assets the way you would treat your own they don’t belong to you they belong to the shareholders one of the things i talk a lot about is the necessity to juggle all of the constituencies that have an interest in the business shareholders customers employees vendors and the communities in which we operate those constituencies are all mildly in conflict with one another in terms of what’s best for them your job as a leader in a company is to find an appropriate way to juggle those conflicting interests so everybody feels like they’re getting a fair deal without letting any one dominate the others because they’ll drag your company down geschke on adobe’s culture read the memo kb i talked about the difference between leadership and management your job as a leader is to create more leaders — not more followers that’s what you need to do as a manager that’s actually a quote from ralph nader depoliticized if you’d like to see that paper i’d be happy to ship it to you there was nothing private about it for more on geschke’s memo see sidebar “geschke on adobe’s culture” don’t tell my friends at the wharton school but i never took a business class in my life john didn’t either knowledgewharton the two of you comanaged the company for much of its history how did you split the tasks and balance what each of you did geschke it’s a very unique business relationship i know a little bit about the internals of the interactions between packard and hewlett — which were very similar in most respects john and i have worked together ever since i hired him in  that’s  years and we’ve never had a serious argument we haven’t always agreed about everything but we never left work angry at one another we had a shared perception of our principles and values we paid ourselves the same we get the same stock options — everything was identical we can’t both have the same title but i don’t care much about titles because it didn’t matter — we were both running the company independent of our title it’s a wonderful way to run a business because it gives you so much more freedom you have a real soul mate although former ceo bruce chizen developed a lot of that relationship with current ceo shantanu narayen running a company can feel pretty lonely who do you talk to that’s one thing john and i have always tried to do for bruce and shantanu we don’t keep an office at adobe i don’t want to be perceived as looking over their shoulders but we make ourselves available anytime that they want to sit down we usually have breakfast once a month with shantanu to chat and see how things are going if he wants to call we’ll be there immediately knowledgewharton are you and john still close now geschke yes i talked to him on the phone yesterday we have common friends in los altos where we live our wives nan and marva have always had a good friendship and our kids get along great it’s been a very unusual very wonderful relationship i feel extremely fortunate i can’t imagine doing it alone knowledgewharton what do you think is the biggest mistake adobe made in its year history geschke that’s always hard to answer i’d say it was trying to prepare for handing over the company to the next generation that was a huge mistake we are so lucky that we were able to recover from that it could have been disastrous it was a combination of a pretty strong economy overall and the fact that once we got the cost controls in place the top line of the business was very healthy so we were able to get back in economic control of the business but that was a scary scary time when you fire your four most senior executives in the same day knowledgewharton looking back on the history of the company what are you most proud of geschke my grandfather and father were letterpress photo engravers i grew up around ink and printing all my life i remember the first color work that we did at adobe i brought home samples of some halftones for printing photographs and i showed them to my dad he took out his engraver’s loupe and looked at it he looked at it again he said “charles…” — when he called me “charles” i knew it was bad news — “charles” he said “this doesn’t look very good” i said “i know dad but i just wanted to show you this because we are going to get it right we’re just not there yet” my father was a very kind and gentle guy — tough but still gentle in the way he was tough about two years later we made dramatic breakthroughs and had gotten to the point where our halftones formed the right kind of rosettes they looked as good if not better than conventional technology for printing i brought a sample home and said “dad we did some new work here i want you to take a look at” he took out his loupe and he looked and he looked about four or five times at it with a big grin on his face he said “charlie…” — he’s one of the few people who could call me charlie — “charlie you’ve done it” and to me that’s the thing i’m proudest of during my dad’s lifetime — fortunately he lived to be almost  — i could show him that i had done something from a completely different direction that he could see the value in you don’t often get a chance to do that with a parent that was really cool knowledgewharton what do you think is the biggest challenge adobe is facing going forward geschke inventing the future we’ll never succeed unless we continue to open up new vistas i honestly believe that our technology and what’s happening in the market — where essentially all visual communication is going to the web — is the sweetheart point in our whole envelope of products and technologies shame on us if we can’t figure out a way to take advantage of that shift in the way the world is moving with the distribution of information a lot of what are there today — the limitations of browsers and of the web imaging standards — are things that we think we have a solution for as they become the primary delivery mechanism that value is going to differentiate supports kws leadership content
