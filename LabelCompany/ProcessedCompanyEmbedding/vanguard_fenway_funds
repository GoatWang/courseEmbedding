agency and it receives capital from the us treasury as needed to maintain a positive net worth in exchange for senior preferred stock adramerican depositary receipt a security valuation securities are valued as of the close of trading on the new york stock exchange generally  pm eastern time on the valuation date equity securities are valued at the latest quoted sales prices or official closing prices taken from the primary market in which each security trades such securities not traded on the valuation date are valued at the mean of the latest quoted bid and asked prices securities for which market quotations are not readily available or whose values have been affected by events occurring before the funds pricing time but after the close of the securities primary markets are valued at their fair values calculated according to procedures adopted by the board of trustees these procedures include obtaining quotations from an independent pricing service monitoring news to identify significant market or securityspecific events and evaluating changes in the values of foreign market proxies for example adrs futures contracts or exchangetraded funds between the time the foreign markets close and the funds pricing time when fairvalue pricing is employed the prices of securities used by a fund to calculate its net asset value may differ from quoted or published prices for the same securities investments in vanguard market liquidity fund are valued at that funds net asset value temporary cash investments acquired over  days to maturity are valued using the latest bid prices or using valuations based on a matrix system which considers such factors as security prices yields maturities and ratings both as furnished by independent pricing services other temporary cash investments are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value b foreign currency securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars using exchange rates obtained from an independent third party as of the funds pricing time on the valuation date realized gains losses and unrealized appreciation depreciation on investment securities include the effects of changes in exchange rates since the securities were purchased combined with the effects of changes in security prices fluctuations in the value of other assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates are recorded as unrealized foreign currency gains losses until the assets or liabilities are settled in cash at which time they are recorded as realized foreign currency gains losses c repurchase agreements the fund enters into repurchase agreements with institutional counterparties securities pledged as collateral to the fund under repurchase agreements are held by a custodian bank until the agreements mature each agreement requires that the market value of the collateral be sufficient to cover payments of interest and principal the fund further mitigates its counterparty risk by entering into repurchase agreements only with a diverse group of prequalified counterparties monitoring their financial strength and entering into master repurchase agreements with its counterparties the master repurchase agreements provide that in the event of a counterpartys default including bankruptcy the fund may terminate any repurchase agreements with that counterparty determine the net amount owed and sell or retain the collateral up to the net amount owed to the fund such action may be subject to legal proceedings which may delay or limit the disposition of collateral d various inputs may be used to determine the value of the funds investments these inputs are summarized in three broad levels for financial statement purposes the inputs or methodologies used to value securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities   equity income fund level —quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level —other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc level —significant unobservable inputs including the funds own assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments the following table summarizes the market value of the funds investments as of december   based on the inputs used to value them   level  level  level  investments    common stocks   — temporary cash investments   — futures contracts—liabilities   — — total   —  represents variation margin on the last day of the reporting period       e futures contracts the fund uses index futures contracts to a limited extent with the objective of maintaining full exposure to the stock market while maintaining liquidity the fund may purchase or sell futures contracts to achieve a desired level of investment whether to accommodate portfolio turnover or cash flows from capital share transactions the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between changes in market values of stocks held by the fund and the prices of futures contracts and the possibility of an illiquid market counterparty risk involving futures is mitigated because a regulated clearinghouse is the counterparty instead of the clearing broker to further mitigate counterparty risk the fund trades futures contracts on an exchange monitors the financial strength of its clearing brokers and clearinghouse and has entered into clearing agreements with its clearing brokers the clearinghouse imposes initial margin requirements to secure the funds performance and requires daily settlement of variation margin representing changes in the market value of each contract futures contracts are valued at their quoted daily settlement prices the aggregate settlement values of the contracts are not recorded in the schedule of investments fluctuations in the value of the contracts are recorded as an asset liability at december   the aggregate settlement value of open futures contracts and the related unrealized appreciation depreciation were                  aggregate

substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its manageddistribution policy an investment in the fund could lose money over short intermediate or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return
