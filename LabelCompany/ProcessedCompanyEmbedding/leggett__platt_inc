recent review sort highest to lowest sort lowest to highest its a dream after over a year of debating and research i purchased the scape split king with a latex mattress specifically for no offgassing i had to communicate with jo several times in customer service re timing of delivery and she was fabulous the bed arrived in two large cardboard boxes about the size of a twin boxspring mattress the mattresses were compressed and in tight rolls the delivery came when i was working a  hour call shift im nursemidwife my husband was against the purchase and washed his hands of it he wasnt happy about the  i spent on it my money anyway i digress he agreed to accept the delivery but said he would have nothing to do with setting the whole thing up for that reason i ordered the white glove service where they set it up for you through a mixup with our local delivery service they were unable to set up just deliver i was sweating it because i didnt want to ask my husband for help so at  after a stressful day of work i came home to find the delivery eeg so exciting my husband was asleep in the guest room and i set to work i open the two adjustable bases the instructions were super clear and easy i popped on the legs and wheels i rolled the beds over and shoved them into place i plugged them in to test them perfect i rebuilt my bed frame around the split king scape bases and then unrolled my latex mattresses and heaved them up on the basesall  lbs of me no problem i did use a  foam topper that we had on our previous king size mattress i just cut it in half with scissors put sheets on showered and did what i couldnt wait to doi fell into that bed and raised the feet up my poor feet were barking from work and it was like being cradled by the hand of god in fact we refer to our bed as the hog hand of god because if feels like the heavens opened up and god stretched out his hands to cradle you to sleep my husband came upstairs to see what the commotion was i was being really quiet but then accidentally dropped the hammer on the hard wood floor and saw that i had assembled everything in about an hour he is now in love with the bed of course he has used a cpap since he was  years old and finds that just a slight incline of his head helps with his sleep apnea before this bed i woke up feeling like i had been beaten with a x i thought there was no way my body could handle being a midwife for many more years now postbed i do not have those morning aches and pains i love this bed im glad i bit the bullet and purchased one now highly recommend to anyone but

happy we were skeptical about ordering online a mattress we had never tried and the generally positive reviews for plushbeds made me wonder if the reviews were screened but i figured in the end the return policy was solid and you never really know a mattress until you sleep on it for a few days but that was a year ago and we still exclaim our love for this bed multiple times per week if not

mattress online but all of the positive reviews convinced my husband and i to take a leap of faith and we are so glad we did we got the  botanical bliss in mediumfirm with the orthopedic foundation we are side and back sleepers and the support has been great for both of us weve been sleeping on our new mattress for  months now and were amazed at how much more comfortable it has been in comparison to our old innerspring pillowtop mattress no more restless sleepless nights no more pain and discomfort in the morning and no more allergies side note the unboxing process is pretty amusing so crazy that they can squeeze a queen sized mattress into such a tiny box just a heads up the mattress is a bit heavy and floppy so its not easy to move around once its rolled out the foundation is sturdy and we were able to assemble it quickly and easily the included supportive latex pillows and super soft egyptian cotton sheets were an awesome added bonus our bed is sooooo comfy now and we would highly

bliss mattress for exactly a month i love it i never thought id make such an important purchase online i couldnt find a pure latex mattress locally when i read their return policy which meant i wouldnt lose any money if i didnt like it i decided to try it i have asked so many friends to come and try it out that im sure they think im a nut case after ten days i decided it was too hard for mei had chosen the medium firm i called plush beds and they immediately sent me a softer replacement for the  topper and it is perfect now its a wonderful bed dont be afraid to try it you have nothing to lose because theyll take it back if you dont like itbut you will like it was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate november   vilma g purchased  year ago was this review helpful yes  no

beds for over a year and i finally chose plushbeds and i am super glad i did for their great service and product i know you cant find a better organic latex bed at an affordable price than at plushbeds i got the cyber monday deal their  year bed warranty and  day comfort exchange is hard to beat was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate december   sjahappy was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate very expensive mistake admittedly comfort if very subjectivebut this was a very disappointing purchase i bought bed approx  years ago usually wake up in more back and hip pain than i went to bed with the problem is that the mattress is rigid not firm with support nor comfy with givesomehow it manages to not be supportive yet also doesnt flex to body contours i spent a lot of time researching because i wanted the least toxic most environmentally friend mattress i could afford i think the materials do meet that criteria i did try the comfort exchange but by the time the new layer came i tried it decided i didnt like it it was too late to return i was prompted to write this review as plush beds came up when i was internet searching for a mattress topper to try to make bed tolerable oh well was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate december   m w was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate i can attest to the fine quality bona fide the real mccoy theyre the real deal the way plushbeds makes their mattresses is really neat when i got my mattress the inch bliss latex mattress i unzipped it to inspect to make sure i wasnt getting a just a top layer of latex with some fillers or generic foam as a core sure enough it was in layers and not glued together like some other mattress companies do it i can attest to the fine quality and comfort of this mattress its perfect was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate april   m conti was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate a great mattress at a great price i just want to say a few words of praise for plushbeds botanical bliss latex mattress for the longest time my wife and i both complained about the mattress we were using without doing anything about it sometimes we would get up mornings grumbling about soreness in our backs shoulders or sides a little over a year ago we finally took action i talked to one of our neighbors a chiropractor and he told us that  natural latex is the best we researched and asked around and found plushbeds to be the best we are very pleased with our decision was this review helpful

years old and doing fine we did a bunch of research i hated the sinking into cement feeling of the tempurpedic along with the smell so we did it we bought a beautiful platform bed and the  botanical bliss and love it i find myself not wanting to get out of the bed in the morning plushbeds says try for  days before you decide if you like it we liked it night one if this holds up and does not

layer which provided the firm support and deep sleep experience we were hoping for my spine stays perfectly aligned when i sleep on my side now it has a healing effect that completely eliminates the

december   gerald k purchased  year ago was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate thrilled with my purchase my family and i live an organic lifestyle it was important for me to have an organic mattress since we spend approximately  years of our life sleeping most nonorganic mattresses contain chemicals and there are longterm health effects that may occur after prolonged exposure to these chemicals including cancers damage to the heart liver central nervous system and kidneys this is not something that i want my family breathing in every night i did a lot of research and checked out all certifications i found plushbeds to be the best  natural latex and organic with all certifications including greenguard gold not many mattresses have this it was great to see i ordered three of the  botanical bliss mattresses for all  bedrooms in our home we received them  days after we placed the order and they were everything that we had hoped they would be when we unwrapped the boxes there were no odors at all the mattresses were easy to set up and after  months of sleeping on them we are thrilled very comfortable feels great on my lower back and body i sleep so well on this mattress it feels great to go to sleep each night knowing that my family and i are not breathing in dangerous chemicals or fumes we are very happy with plushbeds and this mattress was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate march   andressa z was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate good investment we think at  week we got  twin xls to place on the prodigy  split king adjustable bed excellent night sleep even on first night though hard to sort out what part is due to the mattress and what part to the adjustable bed base at least in theory a purely organic bed and bed coverssheets etc without chemicals is attractive hardest part of the mattress purchase is guessing at firmness that will be best we got  med   medfirm  will take more time to decide if one of them should be change to the other but after less than a week conclusion is it was a good purchase that is good for our health our backs and our comfort both the mattress  bases have long warranties so hopefully the k cost is divided over much more than a decade at this point we think it was a good choice was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate june   joseph b purchased  year ago was

purchased  year ago was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate very pleased i too like so many on here was skeptical about ordering a bed online one thing i did was throw out my old steel bed frame and had to retrieve it back as stupidly i thought the foundation came with a frame or something but it is the slates that the mattress actually sits on anyway after unrolling the huge heavy mattress my firest thought was why does it look so slim well that is because i ordered the  mattress and just assumed it would look like the picture of the one on here looks like a very big thick matress but it is notnow that ive had a few days to sleep on the medium firm one i ordered i do love it it does cradle to my bodys pressure points and is a wonderful and healthy sleepso happy i purchased it now another extremely satisfied customer oh you will want to purchase a mattress protector i thought it came protected or something as i asked the sales lady she said yes so you have to

several times in customer service re timing of delivery and she was fabulous the bed arrived in two large cardboard boxes about the size of a twin boxspring mattress the mattresses were compressed and in tight rolls the delivery came when i was working a  hour call shift im nursemidwife my husband was against the purchase and washed his hands of it he wasnt happy about the  i spent on it my money anyway i digress he agreed to accept the delivery but said he would have nothing to do with setting the whole thing up for that reason i ordered the white glove service where they set it up for you through a mixup with our local delivery service they were unable to set up just deliver i was sweating it because i didnt want to ask my husband for help so at  after a stressful day of work i came home to find the delivery eeg so exciting my husband was asleep in the guest room and i set to work i open the two adjustable bases the instructions were super clear and easy i popped on the legs and wheels i rolled the beds over and shoved them into place i plugged them in to test them perfect i rebuilt my bed frame around the split king scape bases and then unrolled my latex mattresses and heaved them up on the basesall  lbs of me no problem i did use a  foam topper that we had on our previous king size mattress i just cut it in half with scissors put sheets on showered and did what i couldnt wait to doi fell into that bed and raised the feet up my poor feet were barking from work and it was like being cradled by the hand of god in fact we refer to our bed as the hog hand of god because if feels like the heavens opened up and god stretched out his hands to cradle you to sleep my husband came upstairs to see what the commotion was i was being really quiet but then accidentally dropped the hammer on the hard wood floor and saw that i had assembled everything in about an hour he is now in love with the bed of course he has used a cpap since he was  years old and finds that just a slight incline of his head helps with his sleep apnea before this bed i woke up feeling like i had been beaten with a x i thought there was no way my body could handle being a midwife for many more years now postbed i do not have those morning aches and pains i love this bed im glad i bit the bullet and purchased one now highly recommend to anyone but if you are a nurse do yourself a favor

chairman  ceo software spectrum inc phoebe a wood  principal companieswood company historyedit jp leggett cb platt in  in carthage missouri jp leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils formed and interlaced then mounted on a wood slat base the bedspring could then be used as a base for the thenpopular cotton feather or horsehair mattresses needing expertise in manufacturing and production he recruited his soontobe brotherinlaw cb platt whose father owned and operated platt plow works into the partnership together they produced the components of their leggett  platt bedspring which was patented in  bedspring vs innerspring at the time of their invention bedsprings referred to coneshaped wire coiled springs attached to a wooden slat foundation used to support thenpopular mattresses these mattresses were typically made of horse hair corn husks cotton feathers or another soft material early bedsprings functioned similarly to todays box springs in their support of a mattress however box springs are rather rigid in structure while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface innersprings by contrast refer to the core system of wire springs that along with various types of foam and other padding materials comprise the insides of todays mattress the mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set innersprings can be coiled springs laced together continuous coil springs or individually encased springs that support a person sleeping on the mattress the carthage market for their new product was very limited to expand the market to a wider region mr platt and george leggett brother of j p leggett would load a horsedrawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities often to conserve space they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk the partnership prospered and the business was incorporated in  the platt plow works the company built its first factory and offices in carthage in  the workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees soon after completion of the carthage plant a second factory was built in louisville kentucky during the next  years three more factories were built demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising and a second plant was built in carthage in  the new much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies in  an additional factory was built in winchester kentucky which was subsequently consolidated with the louisville plant for some time texas had proven to be a main market outlet and in  a major factory was built in ennis texas by  leggett  platt consisted of  plants and  employees although available in various models and continuously improved upon bedsprings were practically the only product leggett  platt offered until  however in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity thereafter the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots along with bed frames and bed rails innerspring mattress components in  harry m cornell jr jp leggett’s grandson was elected president and ceo of the company taking over for his father who was mr leggett’s soninlaw the company’s total sales in  were approximately  million from three states – kentucky texas and missouri determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential mr cornell and his management partners concluded that leggett  platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing marketing and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products first nationally and eventually on a worldwide basis key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program jp

into the partnership together they produced the components of their leggett  platt bedspring which was patented in  bedspring vs innerspring at the time of their invention bedsprings referred to coneshaped wire coiled springs attached to a wooden slat foundation used to support thenpopular mattresses these mattresses were typically made of horse hair corn husks cotton feathers or another soft

jp leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils formed and interlaced then mounted on a wood slat base the bedspring could then be used as a base for the thenpopular cotton feather or horsehair mattresses needing expertise in manufacturing and production he recruited his soontobe brotherinlaw cb platt whose father owned and operated platt plow works into the partnership together they produced the components of their leggett  platt bedspring which was patented in  bedspring vs innerspring at the time of their invention bedsprings referred to coneshaped wire coiled springs attached to a wooden slat foundation used to support thenpopular mattresses these mattresses were typically made of horse hair corn husks cotton feathers or another soft material early bedsprings functioned similarly to todays box springs in their support of a mattress however box springs are rather rigid in structure while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface innersprings by contrast refer to the core system of wire springs that along with various types of foam and other padding materials comprise the insides of todays mattress the mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set innersprings can be coiled springs laced together continuous coil springs or individually encased springs that support a person sleeping on the mattress the carthage market for their new product was very limited to expand the market to a wider region mr platt and george leggett brother of j p leggett would load a horsedrawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities often to conserve space they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk the partnership prospered and the business was incorporated in  the platt plow works the company built its first factory and offices in carthage in  the workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees soon after completion of the carthage plant a second factory was built in louisville kentucky during the next  years three more factories were built demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising and a second plant was built in carthage in  the new much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies in  an additional factory was built in winchester kentucky which was subsequently consolidated with the louisville plant for some time texas had proven to be a main market outlet and in  a major factory was built in ennis texas by  leggett  platt consisted of  plants and  employees although available in various models and continuously improved upon bedsprings were practically the only product leggett  platt offered until  however in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity thereafter the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots along with bed frames and bed rails innerspring mattress components in  harry m cornell jr jp leggett’s grandson was elected president and ceo of the company taking over for his father who was mr leggett’s soninlaw the company’s total sales in  were approximately  million from three states – kentucky texas and missouri determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential mr cornell and his management partners concluded that leggett  platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing marketing and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products first nationally and eventually on a worldwide basis key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth

several times in customer service re timing of delivery and she was fabulous the bed arrived in two large cardboard boxes about the size of a twin boxspring mattress the mattresses were compressed and in tight rolls the delivery came when i was working a  hour call shift im nursemidwife my husband was against the purchase and washed his hands of it he wasnt happy about the  i spent on it my money anyway i digress he agreed to accept the delivery but said he would have nothing to do with setting the whole thing up for that reason i ordered the white glove service where they set it up for you through a mixup with our local delivery service they were unable to set up just deliver i was sweating it because i didnt want to ask my husband for help so at  after a stressful day of work i came home to find the delivery eeg so exciting my husband was asleep in the guest room and i set to work i open the two adjustable bases the instructions were super clear and easy i popped on the legs and wheels i rolled the beds over and shoved them into place i plugged them in to test them perfect i rebuilt my bed frame around the split king scape bases and then unrolled my latex mattresses and heaved them up on the basesall  lbs of me no problem i did use a  foam topper that we had on our previous king size mattress i just cut it in half with scissors put sheets on showered and did what i couldnt wait to doi fell into that bed and raised the feet up my poor feet were barking from work and it was like being cradled by the hand of god in fact we refer to our bed as the hog hand of god because if feels like the heavens opened up and god stretched out his hands to cradle you to sleep my husband came upstairs to see what the commotion was i was being really quiet but then accidentally dropped the hammer on the hard wood floor and saw that i had assembled everything in about an hour he is now in love with the bed of course he has used a cpap since he was  years old and finds that just a slight incline of his head helps with his sleep apnea before this bed i woke up feeling like i had been beaten with a x i thought there was no way my body could handle being a midwife for many more years now postbed i do not have those morning aches and pains i love this bed im glad i bit the bullet and purchased one now highly recommend to anyone but if you are a nurse do yourself a favor

  janice schwartz was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate still happy we were skeptical about ordering online a mattress we had never tried and the generally positive reviews for plushbeds made me wonder if the reviews were screened but i figured in the end the return policy was solid and you never really know a mattress until you sleep on it for a few days but that was a year ago and we still exclaim our love for this bed multiple times per week if not every night was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate may   alex c was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate love our mattress we were incredibly hesitant to purchase a mattress online but all of the positive reviews convinced my husband and i to take a leap of faith and we are so glad we did we got the  botanical bliss in mediumfirm with the orthopedic foundation we are side and back sleepers and the support has been great for both of us weve been sleeping on our new mattress for  months now and were amazed at how much more comfortable it has been in comparison to our old innerspring pillowtop mattress no more restless sleepless nights no more pain and discomfort in the morning and no more allergies side note the unboxing process is pretty amusing so crazy that they can squeeze a queen sized mattress into such a tiny box just a heads up the mattress is a bit heavy and floppy so its not easy to move around once its rolled out the foundation is sturdy and we were able to assemble it quickly and easily the included supportive latex pillows and super soft egyptian cotton sheets were an awesome added bonus our bed is sooooo comfy now and we would highly recommend giving a plushbeds mattress a try  stars all around for ultimate comfort quality products great value fast shipping and

 no  flag as inappropriate december   sjahappy was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate very expensive mistake admittedly comfort if very subjectivebut this was a very disappointing purchase i bought bed approx  years ago usually wake up in more back and hip pain than i went to bed with the problem is that the mattress is rigid not firm with support nor comfy with givesomehow it manages to not be supportive yet also doesnt flex to body contours i spent a lot of time researching because i wanted the least toxic most environmentally friend mattress i could afford i think the materials do meet that criteria i did try the comfort exchange but by the time the new layer came i tried it decided i didnt like it it was too late to return i was prompted to write this review as plush beds came up when i was internet searching for a mattress topper to try to make bed tolerable oh well was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate december   m w was this review

purchased  year ago was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate botanical bliss all personnel i talked to were professional helpful and courteous i originally ordered a too firm a mattress and exchange was seamless and prompt both my wife and i are happy with mattresses and adjustable bases we have since ordered a bontanical bliss for my mother in law and she love it as well was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate december   gerald k purchased  year ago was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate thrilled with my purchase my family and i live an organic lifestyle it was important for me to have an organic mattress since we spend approximately  years of our life sleeping most nonorganic mattresses contain chemicals and there are longterm health effects that may occur after prolonged exposure to these chemicals including cancers damage to the heart liver central nervous system and kidneys this is not something that i want my family breathing in every night i did a lot of research and checked out all certifications i found plushbeds to be the best  natural latex and organic with all certifications including greenguard gold not many mattresses have this it was great to see i ordered three of the  botanical bliss mattresses for all  bedrooms in our home we received them  days after we placed the order and they were everything that we had hoped they would be when we unwrapped the boxes there were no odors at all the mattresses were easy to set up and after  months of sleeping on them we are thrilled very comfortable feels great on my lower back and body i sleep so well on this mattress it feels great to go to sleep each night knowing that my family and i are not breathing in dangerous chemicals or fumes we are very happy with plushbeds and this mattress was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate march   andressa z was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate good investment we think at  week we got  twin xls to place on the prodigy  split king adjustable bed excellent night sleep even on first night though hard to sort out what part is due to the mattress and what part to the adjustable bed base at least in theory a purely organic bed and bed coverssheets etc without chemicals is attractive hardest part of the mattress purchase is guessing at firmness that will be best we got  med   medfirm  will take more time to decide if one of them should be change to the other but after less than a week conclusion is it was a good purchase that is good for our health our backs and our comfort both the mattress  bases have long warranties so hopefully the k cost is divided over much more than a decade at this point we think it was a good choice was this review helpful yes  no  flag

amazing thing about this mattress it almost feels like youre floating  there is nothing beneath you and yet you feel completely supported i guess its because you cant feel any pressure points no

november   amanda p purchased  year ago was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate best yet my husband and i saw this mattress the botanical bliss which was advertised online by plushbeds after having bad results from other mattress companies in the past  theirs either sunk in the middle after a few months became lumpy or way too soft after a few months we tried plushbeds botanical bliss in the xtra firm we love it it has stayed firm and we get a good sleep each nite only wish we had found this sooner they were polite and helpful in regards to putting it together which was no problem at all we would highly recommend them mr  mrs kuty was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate november   constance green k purchased  year ago was this review helpful yes  no  flag

ordering a bed online one thing i did was throw out my old steel bed frame and had to retrieve it back as stupidly i thought the foundation came with a frame or something but it is the slates that the mattress actually sits on anyway after unrolling the huge heavy mattress my firest thought was why does it look so slim well that is because i ordered the  mattress and just assumed it would look like the picture of the one on here looks like a very big thick matress but it is notnow that ive had a few days to sleep on the medium firm one i ordered i do love it it does cradle to my bodys pressure points and is a wonderful and healthy sleepso happy i purchased it now another extremely satisfied customer oh you will want to purchase a mattress protector i thought it came protected or something as i asked the sales lady she said yes so you have to go purchase one somewhere separatelyon the free pillows sent you can fold them in half so i dont know how they will support your neck or head but

with a latex mattress specifically for no offgassing i had to communicate with jo several times in customer service re timing of delivery and she was fabulous the bed arrived in two large cardboard boxes about the size of a twin boxspring mattress the mattresses were compressed and in tight rolls the delivery came when i was working a  hour call shift im nursemidwife my husband was against the purchase and washed his hands of it he wasnt happy about the  i spent on it my money anyway i digress he agreed to accept the delivery but said he would have nothing to do with setting the whole thing up for that reason i ordered the white glove service where they set it up for you through a mixup with our local delivery service they were unable to set up just deliver i was sweating it because i didnt want to ask my husband for help so at  after a stressful day of work i came home to find the delivery eeg so exciting my husband was asleep in the guest room and i set to work i open the two adjustable bases the instructions were super clear and easy i popped on the legs and wheels i rolled the beds over and shoved them into place i plugged them in to test them perfect i rebuilt my bed frame around the split king scape bases and then unrolled my latex mattresses and heaved them up on the basesall  lbs of me no problem i did use a  foam topper that we had on our previous king size mattress i just cut it in half with scissors put sheets on showered and did what i couldnt wait to doi fell into that bed and raised the feet up my poor feet were barking from work and it was like being cradled by the hand of god in fact we refer to our bed as the hog hand of god because if feels like the heavens opened up and god stretched out his hands to cradle you to sleep my husband came upstairs to see what the commotion was i was being really quiet but then accidentally dropped the hammer on the hard wood floor and saw that i had assembled everything in about an hour he is now in love with the bed of course he has used a cpap since he was  years old and finds that just a slight incline of his head helps with his sleep apnea before this bed i woke up feeling like i had been beaten with a x i thought there was no way my body could handle being a midwife for many more years now postbed i do not have those morning aches and pains i love this bed im glad i bit the bullet and purchased one now highly recommend to anyone but if you are a nurse do yourself a favor and get an adjustable bed  hour shifts are brutal you deserve it  stars was this review helpful yes  no  flag as

sleeping into a luxury experience i like to move the head of the bed upwards to sit up and watch tv and also to read before bed i also like to turn on the massage and it puts me to sleep at night  i

chairman  ceo software spectrum inc phoebe a wood  principal companieswood company historyedit jp leggett cb platt in  in carthage missouri jp leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils formed and interlaced then mounted on a wood slat base the bedspring could then be used as a base for the thenpopular cotton feather or horsehair mattresses needing expertise in manufacturing and production he recruited his soontobe brotherinlaw cb platt whose father owned and operated platt plow works into the partnership together they produced the components of their leggett  platt bedspring which was patented in  bedspring vs innerspring at the time of their invention bedsprings referred to coneshaped wire coiled springs attached to a wooden slat foundation used to support thenpopular mattresses these mattresses were typically made of horse hair corn husks cotton feathers or another soft material early bedsprings functioned similarly to todays box springs in their support of a mattress however box springs are rather rigid in structure while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface innersprings by contrast refer to the core system of wire springs that along with various types of foam and other padding materials comprise the insides of todays mattress the mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set innersprings can be coiled springs laced together continuous coil springs or individually encased springs that support a person sleeping on the mattress the carthage market for their new product was very limited to expand the market to a wider region mr platt and george leggett brother of j p leggett would load a horsedrawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities often to conserve space they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk the partnership prospered and the business was incorporated in  the platt plow works the company built its first factory and offices in carthage in  the workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees soon after completion of the carthage plant a second factory was built in louisville kentucky during the next  years three more factories were built demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising and a second plant was built in carthage in  the new much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies in  an additional factory was built in winchester kentucky which was subsequently consolidated with the louisville plant for some time texas had proven to be a main market outlet and in  a major factory was built in ennis texas by  leggett  platt consisted of  plants and  employees although available in various models and continuously improved upon bedsprings were practically the only product leggett  platt offered until  however in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity thereafter the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots along with bed frames and bed rails innerspring mattress components in  harry m cornell jr jp leggett’s grandson was elected president and ceo of the company taking over for his father who was mr leggett’s soninlaw the company’s total sales in  were approximately  million from three states – kentucky texas and missouri determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential mr cornell and his management partners concluded that leggett  platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing marketing and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products first nationally and eventually on a worldwide basis key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program jp

ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a

does my ad appear your ads could appear on the top or to the right of bing yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat
