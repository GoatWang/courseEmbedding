improve from their fourthplace finish in  to capturing the national league central division title and claimed his first gold glove award in the process after the season the cardinals signed him to a threeyear million contract after teammate darryl kiles sudden death in the summer of  matheny showed that he was an inspirational leader helping the team to cope and make it to the national league championship series after the  season the st louis and houston chapters of the bbwaa voted for matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in kiles honor bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher matheny again won gold gloves with the cardinals in  and  his defensive contributions helped st louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team including

cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training they announced him as their new manager on november   following tony la russas retirement making him the youngest manager in the major leagues the move was seen as unexpected as matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor moreover he was taking over a team that had just won the world series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history mathenys other prior coaching experience included little league baseball and other interviewees included terry francona ryne sandberg josé oquendo chris maloney and joe mcewing all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues in spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors matheny guided the cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and nlcs appearance in each of his first three seasons becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this first season as manager edit on april   matheny won in his managerial debut against the miami marlins in the first game of their new ballpark twenty days later matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safeout call by umpire bill welke in the bottom of the th inning of a  loss to the chicago cubs in another contest against the marlins later that season a bungled double switch left matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings incidentally that pitcher catalyzed a st louis victory in his role as a batter with the score tied – in the bottom of the ninth inning at marlins park on june  matheny presented the action to home plate umpire bob davidson to place relief pitcher víctor marte in the game for fellow pitcher sam freeman simultaneously infielder tyler greene substituted for third baseman david freese originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup matheny assigned greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which freeman previously occupied – and play second base the second baseman already in the game daniel descalso shifted to third base matheny showed davidson these actions on the lineup card and with davidson looking on wrote  used to designate the position of the third baseman next to descalsos name when davidson conveyed the changes to marlins manager ozzie guillén a communication error transpired after marte faced one batter guillén vaulted from the marlins dugout to argue that marte and first baseman allen craig the number five hitter couldnt be on the field at the same time despite his effort to oppose guilléns protest davidson ruled for matheny to remove craig he substituted tony cruz at first base erasing two of the cardinals top hitters craig and freese from the game in the top of the tenth marte was due in craigs fifth spot with no regular batters remaining matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for marte rookie pitcher joe kelly the cardinals had gained the lead – at this point and kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs he beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and rbi – and put the cardinals up – this run proved to be crucial insurance as miamis omar infante scored on a john buck

leadership and skills profileedit because the cardinals had hired matheny as manager following the  season questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one particularly because he succeeded a world serieswinning manager of  years in la russa matheny had never been a fulltime coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball however he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader he became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players flaws especially with the media fans and media have questioned his tactical skills but due to his experience playing a position catcher that imputes the requirement for leadership it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure however with the success of his first two seasons it became apparent matheny was a good choice to manage the cardinals said former cardinal and veteran lance berkman people make a big deal out of not having coached or managed  you can take a guy with no people skills no leadership ability let him manage in the minor leagues for  years and hell never be ready to manage at the major league level and you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles put him in the big leagues and he can be a hall of fame manager matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership one central tenet of which is to be accessible and to enable ones subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them in one of his blogs matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve well before becoming manager matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players the cardinals hiring of matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the detroit tigers hiring of brad ausmus for their managerial position

the cardinals with a  fielding percentage and throwing out  of wouldbe base stealers well above the league average of  matheny helped the cardinals improve from their fourthplace finish in  to capturing the national league central division title and claimed his first gold glove award in the process after the season the cardinals signed him to a threeyear million contract after teammate

louis and houston chapters of the bbwaa voted for matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in kiles honor bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher matheny again won

adviser for the first two weeks of spring training they announced him as their new manager on november   following tony la russas retirement making him the youngest manager in the major leagues the move was seen as unexpected as matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor moreover he was taking over a team that had just won the world series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history mathenys other prior coaching experience included little league baseball and other interviewees included terry francona ryne sandberg josé oquendo chris maloney and joe mcewing all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues in spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors matheny guided the cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and nlcs appearance in each of his first three seasons becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this first season as manager edit on april   matheny won in his managerial debut against the miami marlins in the first game of their new ballpark twenty days later matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safeout call by umpire bill welke in the bottom of the th inning of a  loss to the chicago cubs in another contest against the marlins later that season a bungled double switch left matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings incidentally that pitcher catalyzed a st louis victory in his role as a batter with the score tied – in the bottom of the ninth inning at marlins park on june  matheny presented the action to home plate umpire bob davidson to place relief pitcher víctor marte in the game for fellow pitcher sam freeman simultaneously infielder tyler greene substituted for third baseman david freese originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup matheny assigned greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which freeman previously occupied – and play second base the second baseman already in the game daniel descalso shifted to third base matheny showed davidson these actions on the lineup card and with davidson looking on wrote  used to designate the position of the third baseman next to descalsos name when davidson conveyed the changes to marlins manager ozzie guillén a communication error transpired after marte faced one batter guillén vaulted from the marlins dugout to argue that marte and first baseman allen craig the number five hitter couldnt be on the field at the same time despite his effort to oppose guilléns protest davidson ruled for matheny to remove craig he substituted tony cruz at first base erasing two of the cardinals top hitters craig and freese from the game in the top of the tenth marte was due in craigs fifth spot with no regular batters remaining matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for marte rookie pitcher joe kelly the cardinals had gained the lead – at this point and kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs he beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and rbi – and put the cardinals up – this run proved to be crucial insurance as miamis omar infante scored on a john buck single in the bottom of the tenth nevertheless

had hired matheny as manager following the  season questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one particularly because he succeeded a world serieswinning manager of  years in la russa matheny had never been a fulltime coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball however he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader he became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players flaws especially with the media fans and media have questioned his tactical skills but due to his experience playing a position catcher that imputes the requirement for leadership it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure however with the success of his first two seasons it became apparent matheny was a good choice to manage the cardinals said former cardinal and veteran lance berkman people make a big deal out of not having coached or managed  you can take a guy with no people skills no leadership ability let him manage in the minor leagues for  years and hell never be ready to manage at the major league level and you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles put him in the big leagues and he can be a hall of fame manager matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership one central tenet of which is to be accessible and to enable ones subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them in one of his blogs matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve well before becoming manager matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players the cardinals hiring of matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the detroit tigers hiring of brad ausmus for their managerial position late in  similarly ausmus replaced a

adviser for the first two weeks of spring training they announced him as their new manager on november   following tony la russas retirement making him the youngest manager in the major leagues the move was seen as unexpected as matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor moreover he was taking over a team that had just won the world series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history mathenys other prior coaching experience included little league baseball and other interviewees included terry francona ryne sandberg josé oquendo chris maloney and joe mcewing all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues in spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors matheny guided the cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and nlcs appearance in each of his first three seasons becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this first season as manager edit on april   matheny won in his managerial debut against the miami marlins in the first game of their new ballpark twenty days later matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safeout call by umpire bill welke in the bottom of the th inning of a  loss to the chicago cubs in another contest against the marlins later that season a bungled double switch left matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings incidentally that pitcher catalyzed a st louis victory in his role as a batter with the score tied – in the bottom of the ninth inning at marlins park on june  matheny presented the action to home plate umpire bob davidson to place relief pitcher víctor marte in the game for fellow pitcher sam freeman simultaneously infielder tyler greene substituted for third baseman david freese originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup matheny assigned greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which freeman previously occupied – and play second base the second baseman already in the game daniel descalso shifted to third base matheny showed davidson these actions on the lineup card and with davidson looking on wrote  used to designate the position of the third baseman next to descalsos name when davidson conveyed the changes to marlins manager ozzie guillén a communication error transpired after marte faced one batter guillén vaulted from the marlins dugout to argue that marte and first baseman allen craig the number five hitter couldnt be on the field at the same time despite his effort to oppose guilléns protest davidson ruled for matheny to remove craig he substituted tony cruz at first base erasing two of the cardinals top hitters craig and freese from the game in the top of the tenth marte was due in craigs fifth spot with no regular batters remaining matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for marte rookie pitcher joe kelly the cardinals had gained the lead – at this point and kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs he beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and rbi – and put the cardinals up – this run proved to be crucial insurance as miamis omar infante scored on a john buck single in the bottom of the tenth nevertheless

had hired matheny as manager following the  season questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one particularly because he succeeded a world serieswinning manager of  years in la russa matheny had never been a fulltime coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball however he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader he became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players flaws especially with the media fans and media have questioned his tactical skills but due to his experience playing a position catcher that imputes the requirement for leadership it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure however with the success of his first two seasons it became apparent matheny was a good choice to manage the cardinals said former cardinal and veteran lance berkman people make a big deal out of not having coached or managed  you can take a guy with no people skills no leadership ability let him manage in the minor leagues for  years and hell never be ready to manage at the major league level and you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles put him in the big leagues and he can be a hall of fame manager matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership one central tenet of which is to be accessible and to enable ones subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them in one of his blogs matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve well before becoming manager matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players the cardinals hiring of matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the detroit tigers hiring of brad ausmus for their managerial position late in  similarly ausmus replaced a

capturing the national league central division title and claimed his first gold glove award in the process after the season the cardinals signed him to a threeyear million contract after teammate darryl kiles sudden death in the summer of  matheny showed that he was an inspirational leader helping the team to cope and make it to the national league championship series after the  season the st louis and houston chapters of the bbwaa voted for matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in kiles honor bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher matheny again won

adviser for the first two weeks of spring training they announced him as their new manager on november   following tony la russas retirement making him the youngest manager in the major leagues the move was seen as unexpected as matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor moreover he was taking over a team that had just won the world series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history mathenys other prior coaching experience included little league baseball and other interviewees included terry francona ryne sandberg josé oquendo chris maloney and joe mcewing all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues in spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors matheny guided the cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and nlcs appearance in each of his first three seasons becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this first season as manager edit on april   matheny won in his managerial debut against the miami marlins in the first game of their new ballpark twenty days later matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safeout call by umpire bill welke in the bottom of the th inning of a  loss to the chicago cubs in another contest against the marlins later that season a bungled double switch left matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings incidentally that pitcher catalyzed a st louis victory in his role as a batter with the score tied – in the bottom of the ninth inning at marlins park on june  matheny presented the action to home plate umpire bob davidson to place relief pitcher víctor marte in the game for fellow pitcher sam freeman simultaneously infielder tyler greene substituted for third baseman david freese originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup matheny assigned greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which freeman previously occupied – and play second base the second baseman already in the game daniel descalso shifted to third base matheny showed davidson these actions on the lineup card and with davidson looking on wrote  used to designate the position of the third baseman next to descalsos name when davidson conveyed the changes to marlins manager ozzie guillén a communication error transpired after marte faced one batter guillén vaulted from the marlins dugout to argue that marte and first baseman allen craig the number five hitter couldnt be on the field at the same time despite his effort to oppose guilléns protest davidson ruled for matheny to remove craig he substituted tony cruz at first base erasing two of the cardinals top hitters craig and freese from the game in the top of the tenth marte was due in craigs fifth spot with no regular batters remaining matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for marte rookie pitcher joe kelly the cardinals had gained the lead – at this point and kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs he beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and rbi – and put the cardinals up – this run proved to be crucial insurance as miamis omar infante scored on a john buck single in the bottom of the tenth nevertheless

had hired matheny as manager following the  season questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one particularly because he succeeded a world serieswinning manager of  years in la russa matheny had never been a fulltime coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball however he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader he became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players flaws especially with the media fans and media have questioned his tactical skills but due to his experience playing a position catcher that imputes the requirement for leadership it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure however with the success of his first two seasons it became apparent matheny was a good choice to manage the cardinals said former cardinal and veteran lance berkman people make a big deal out of not having coached or managed  you can take a guy with no people skills no leadership ability let him manage in the minor leagues for  years and hell never be ready to manage at the major league level and you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles put him in the big leagues and he can be a hall of fame manager matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership one central tenet of which is to be accessible and to enable ones subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them in one of his blogs matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve well before becoming manager matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players the cardinals hiring of matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the detroit tigers hiring of brad ausmus for their managerial position late in  similarly ausmus replaced a

mike matheny « search search search menu search mike matheny’s record will be a product of talent luck  definitely not mike matheny jeff currygetty images mlb november   by jonah keri facebook twitter print the st louis cardinals won two world series under tony la russa only two managers ever won more games than la russa at the time of his retirement la russa’s  years with the cardinals was the longestrunning tenure for any manager with any team whatever one thought about la russa’s personality or tactics as a manager one thing was clear the cardinals believed in continuity and tlr rewarded them for that belief naturally when the time came to replace la russa the cardinals locked in on one candidate mike matheny the choice with exactly zero fulltime managing or coaching experience at any level matheny’s hire might lead you to think the cardinals are taking a huge risk by tapping a new skipper whose entire postplaying career experience with the cardinals boiled down to a special adviser role for two weeks in spring training three years ago but we’ve seen this before elias notes that five other firsttime managers have taken over a defending world series champion bill carrigan  red sox jack barry  red sox and bill virdon  pirates along with two cardinals skippers bob o’farrell  cardinals and red schoendienst  cardinals go back through baseball history and you’ll find numerous other cases of zeroexperience managers in some instances they failed spectacularly in others they succeeded about a month ago robin ventura was hired by the white sox with just scant coaching experience and no managing experience but the best example we can judge also ranks as one of the worst aj hinch served four years in the diamondbacks front office the last three as director of player development after arizona’s slow start in  hinch got booted downstairs to manage the team from may of that year until july  the diamondbacks compiled a brutal  record despite fielding a nucleus that included several impressive young players when kirk gibson guided arizona to the nl west title a year later skeptics could have seen that success as a final affirmation of hinch’s failures as skipper — though the diamondbacks’ inability to build a functional bullpen and some key players being a year or two away from breaking out probably sealed hinch’s fate more than anything perhaps even odder than a move from front office to manager are the times teams looked to the broadcast booth to find their next skipper after eight years calling games for the padres jerry coleman found his way into the manager’s chair in  granted just that one year at the helm coleman guided the padres to a  record — no big surprise given how lousy the team had been a year earlier when it actually won five fewer games larry dierker was a color commentator for the astros for  seasons before gaining the manager’s job in  he enjoyed tremendous success winning four division titles in five seasons though with four firstround playoff exits this too wasn’t a surprise given a dynamic core that included future hall of famers jeff bagwell and craig biggio and other stars finally we have a nowextinct brand of field general the playermanager three of the most recent examples met with mixed results themselves frank robinson became the indians’ playermanager in  then went on to finish three games below  over the ensuing three seasons he saw better results later in his managerial career joe torre took over as mets playermanager in may  even though he played his final game earlier that month pete rose compiled a solid  record as taking over as playermanager of the reds in august  though he’s best remembered for getting banned from baseball on charges that he gambled on his own team the common denominator here is simply talent level studies in the book baseball between the numbers and elsewhere show that the vast majority of managers don’t make much of a difference to their teams one way or another over the long haul even in smallsample highpressure moments such as playoff games their mistakes can lead to baseball miracles there are multiple reasons that may have driven the cardinals to hire matheny there’s a longstanding belief within the game that catchers make great managers due to their supposed leadership and gamecalling skills  even though we’ve yet to see compelling evidence that excatchers make significantly better managers than exsecond basemen or exrodeo clowns perhaps this was simply a case of cardinals gm john mozeliak going with the guy he liked the most especially after a strong interview or maybe there’s a tiny chance that albert pujols might be persuaded to stay in st louis rather than leave via free agency in part because his old teammate matheny will be calling the shots not some unknown outsider  though money will surely play a bigger role in the decision ultimately we have no way of knowing how this experiment might go because matheny offers no track record on which to peg our predictions if you insist on reading the tea leaves try this if pujols stays in st louis and remains a superstar throughout the bulk of his next contract if adam wainwright returns to full strength after tommy john surgery if the cardinals young bullpen shelby miller and other nextgeneration pieces come through the cardinals will probably look like geniuses if they don’t they probably won’t this might seem an unsatisfying answer to an elemental question but to quote one very successful very polarizing skipper that’s the way baseball go espn stats and info contributed

state university university of michigan coach bud middaugh offered him a scholarship to attend michigan because of his defensive and throwing skills matheny drew the notice of major league scouts while in high school the toronto blue jays drafted him in the st round of the  major league baseball draft but waited two days until after the draft ended to inform matheny they had chosen him at first they refused to disclose to him in which round they had selected him two days before he was due to attend his first class blue jays general manager pat gillick appeared at mathenys home to convince him to sign gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for secondround picks during that time teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year the blue jays constantly called matheny until the morning of his first class hoping he would sign confounded by the blue jays overtures matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point so he chose to attend college instead prior to proceeding to his first class he called the blue jays from his dormitory

matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor moreover he was taking over a team that had just won the world series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history mathenys other prior coaching experience included little league baseball and other interviewees included terry francona ryne sandberg josé oquendo chris maloney and joe mcewing all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues in spite of the lack of substantial

role as a batter with the score tied – in the bottom of the ninth inning at marlins park on june  matheny presented the action to home plate umpire bob davidson to place relief pitcher víctor marte in the game for fellow pitcher sam freeman simultaneously infielder tyler greene substituted for third baseman david freese originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup matheny assigned greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which freeman previously occupied – and play second base the second baseman already in the game daniel descalso shifted to third base matheny showed davidson these actions on the lineup card and with davidson looking on wrote  used to designate the position of the third baseman next to descalsos name when davidson conveyed the changes to marlins manager ozzie guillén a communication error transpired after marte faced one batter guillén vaulted from the marlins dugout to argue that marte and first baseman allen craig the number five hitter couldnt be on the field at the same time despite his effort to oppose guilléns protest davidson ruled for matheny to remove craig he substituted tony cruz at first base erasing two of the cardinals top hitters craig and freese from the game in the top of the tenth marte was due in craigs fifth spot with no regular batters remaining matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for marte rookie pitcher joe

as manager following the  season questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one particularly because he succeeded a world serieswinning manager of  years in la russa matheny had never been a fulltime coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball however he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader he became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players flaws especially with the media fans and media have questioned his tactical skills but due to his experience playing a position catcher that imputes the requirement for leadership it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure however with the success of his first two seasons it became apparent matheny was a good choice to manage the cardinals said former cardinal and veteran lance berkman people make a big deal out of not having coached or managed  you can take a guy with no people skills no leadership ability let him manage in the minor leagues for  years and hell never be ready to manage at the major league level and you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles put him in the big leagues and he can be a hall of fame manager matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership one central tenet of which is to be accessible and to enable ones subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them in one of his blogs matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve well before becoming manager matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players the cardinals hiring of matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was

cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training they announced him as their new manager on november   following tony la russas retirement making him the youngest manager in the major leagues the move was seen as unexpected as matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor moreover he was taking over a team that had just won the world series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history mathenys other prior coaching experience included little league baseball and other interviewees included terry francona ryne sandberg josé oquendo chris maloney and joe mcewing all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues in spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors matheny guided the cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and nlcs appearance in each of his first three seasons becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this first season as manager edit on april   matheny won in his managerial debut against the miami marlins in the first game of their new ballpark twenty days later matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safeout call by umpire bill welke in the bottom of the th inning of a  loss to the chicago cubs in another contest against the marlins later that season a bungled double switch left matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings incidentally that pitcher catalyzed a st louis victory in his role as a batter with the score tied – in the bottom of the ninth inning at marlins park on june  matheny presented the action to home plate umpire bob davidson to place relief pitcher víctor marte in the game for fellow pitcher sam freeman simultaneously infielder tyler greene substituted for third baseman david freese originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup matheny assigned greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which freeman previously occupied – and play second base the second baseman already in the game daniel descalso shifted to third base matheny showed davidson these actions on the lineup card and with davidson looking on wrote  used to designate the position of the third baseman next to descalsos name when davidson conveyed the changes to marlins manager ozzie guillén a communication error transpired after marte faced one batter guillén vaulted from the marlins dugout to argue that marte and first baseman allen craig the number five hitter couldnt be on the field at the same time despite his effort to oppose guilléns protest davidson ruled for matheny to remove craig he substituted tony cruz at first base erasing two of the cardinals top hitters craig and freese from the game in the top of the tenth marte was due in craigs fifth spot with no regular batters remaining matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for marte rookie pitcher joe kelly the cardinals had gained the lead – at this point and kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs he beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and rbi – and put the cardinals up – this run proved to be crucial insurance as miamis omar infante scored on a john buck

leadership and skills profileedit because the cardinals had hired matheny as manager following the  season questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one particularly because he succeeded a world serieswinning manager of  years in la russa matheny had never been a fulltime coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball however he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader he became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players flaws especially with the media fans and media have questioned his tactical skills but due to his experience playing a position catcher that imputes the requirement for leadership it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure however with the success of his first two seasons it became apparent matheny was a good choice to manage the cardinals said former cardinal and veteran lance berkman people make a big deal out of not having coached or managed  you can take a guy with no people skills no leadership ability let him manage in the minor leagues for  years and hell never be ready to manage at the major league level and you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles put him in the big leagues and he can be a hall of fame manager matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership one central tenet of which is to be accessible and to enable ones subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them in one of his blogs matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve well before becoming manager matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players the cardinals hiring of matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the detroit tigers hiring of brad ausmus for their managerial position

inspirational leader helping the team to cope and make it to the national league championship series after the  season the st louis and houston chapters of the bbwaa voted for matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in kiles honor bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher matheny again won gold gloves with the cardinals in  and  his defensive contributions helped

as their new manager on november   following tony la russas retirement making him the youngest manager in the major leagues the move was seen as unexpected as matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor moreover he was taking over a team that had just won the world series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history mathenys other prior coaching experience included little league baseball and other interviewees included terry francona ryne sandberg josé oquendo chris maloney and joe mcewing all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues in spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors matheny guided the cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and nlcs appearance in each of his first three seasons becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this first season as manager edit on april   matheny won in his managerial debut against the miami marlins in the first game of their new ballpark twenty days later matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safeout call by umpire bill welke in the bottom of the th inning of a  loss to the chicago cubs in another contest against the marlins later that season a bungled double switch left matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings incidentally that pitcher catalyzed a st louis victory in his role as a batter with the score tied – in the bottom of the ninth inning at marlins park on june  matheny presented the action to home plate umpire bob davidson to place relief pitcher víctor marte in the game for fellow pitcher sam freeman simultaneously infielder tyler greene substituted for third baseman david freese originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup matheny assigned greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which freeman previously occupied – and play second base the second baseman already in the game daniel descalso shifted to third base matheny showed davidson these actions on the lineup card and with davidson looking on wrote  used to designate the position of the third baseman next to descalsos name when davidson conveyed the changes to marlins manager ozzie guillén a communication error transpired after marte faced one batter guillén vaulted from the marlins dugout to argue that marte and first baseman allen craig the number five hitter couldnt be on the field at the same time despite his effort to oppose guilléns protest davidson ruled for matheny to remove craig he substituted tony cruz at first base erasing two of the cardinals top hitters craig and freese from the game in the top of the tenth marte was due in craigs fifth spot with no regular batters remaining matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for marte rookie pitcher joe kelly the cardinals had gained the lead – at this point and kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs he beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and rbi – and put the cardinals up – this run proved to be crucial insurance as miamis omar infante scored on a john buck single in the bottom of the tenth nevertheless jason motte kellys replacement closed it out for the

season questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one particularly because he succeeded a world serieswinning manager of  years in la russa matheny had never been a fulltime coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball however he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader he became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players flaws especially with the media fans and media have questioned his tactical skills but due to his experience playing a position catcher that imputes the requirement for leadership it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure however with the success of his first two seasons it became apparent matheny was a good choice to manage the cardinals said former cardinal and veteran lance berkman people make a big deal out of not having coached or managed  you can take a guy with no people skills no leadership ability let him manage in the minor leagues for  years and hell never be ready to manage at the major league level and you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles put him in the big leagues and he can be a hall of fame manager matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership one central tenet of which is to be accessible and to enable ones subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them in one of his blogs matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve well before becoming manager matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players the cardinals hiring of matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the detroit tigers hiring of brad ausmus for their managerial position late in  similarly ausmus replaced a legendary manager in jim leyland awards and accomplishmentsedit

gillick appeared at mathenys home to convince him to sign gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for secondround picks during that time teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom of the following academic year the blue jays constantly called matheny until the morning of his first class hoping he would sign confounded by the blue jays overtures matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point so he chose to attend college instead prior to proceeding to his first class he called

as darrin fletchers understudy gillick had resigned in  however toronto released him after the season and he signed with the st louis cardinals on december   st louis cardinals –edit matheny barely

the cardinals with a  fielding percentage and throwing out  of wouldbe base stealers well above the league average of  matheny helped the cardinals improve from their fourthplace finish in  to capturing the national league central division title and claimed his first gold glove award in the process after the season the cardinals signed him to a threeyear million contract after teammate darryl kiles sudden death in the summer of  matheny showed that he was an inspirational leader helping the team to cope and make it to the national league championship series after the  season the st louis and houston chapters of the bbwaa voted for matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in kiles honor bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher matheny again won

adviser for the first two weeks of spring training they announced him as their new manager on november   following tony la russas retirement making him the youngest manager in the major leagues the move was seen as unexpected as matheny had no prior managing or coaching experience in professional baseball besides that as a minor league instructor moreover he was taking over a team that had just won the world series and for another manager who was one of the top three achievers in wins for the role in major league history mathenys other prior coaching experience included little league baseball and other interviewees included terry francona ryne sandberg josé oquendo chris maloney and joe mcewing all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues in spite of the lack of substantial achievement as demonstrated by his competitors matheny guided the cardinals to a winning record and a playoff and nlcs appearance in each of his first three seasons becoming the fifth manager in major league history to accomplish this first season as manager edit on april   matheny won in his managerial debut against the miami marlins in the first game of their new ballpark twenty days later matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safeout call by umpire bill welke in the bottom of the th inning of a  loss to the chicago cubs in another contest against the marlins later that season a bungled double switch left matheny with only pitchers available on the bench to pinch hit in extra innings incidentally that pitcher catalyzed a st louis victory in his role as a batter with the score tied – in the bottom of the ninth inning at marlins park on june  matheny presented the action to home plate umpire bob davidson to place relief pitcher víctor marte in the game for fellow pitcher sam freeman simultaneously infielder tyler greene substituted for third baseman david freese originally batting in the seventh spot in the lineup matheny assigned greene to bat ninth – the order in the lineup which freeman previously occupied – and play second base the second baseman already in the game daniel descalso shifted to third base matheny showed davidson these actions on the lineup card and with davidson looking on wrote  used to designate the position of the third baseman next to descalsos name when davidson conveyed the changes to marlins manager ozzie guillén a communication error transpired after marte faced one batter guillén vaulted from the marlins dugout to argue that marte and first baseman allen craig the number five hitter couldnt be on the field at the same time despite his effort to oppose guilléns protest davidson ruled for matheny to remove craig he substituted tony cruz at first base erasing two of the cardinals top hitters craig and freese from the game in the top of the tenth marte was due in craigs fifth spot with no regular batters remaining matheny chose a former college outfielder to bat for marte rookie pitcher joe kelly the cardinals had gained the lead – at this point and kelly batted with the bases loaded and two outs he beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run – his first major league hit and rbi – and put the cardinals up – this run proved to be crucial insurance as miamis omar infante scored on a john buck single in the bottom of the tenth nevertheless

had hired matheny as manager following the  season questions surfaced as to whether this personnel move had been a savvy one particularly because he succeeded a world serieswinning manager of  years in la russa matheny had never been a fulltime coach or manager in any capacity in professional baseball however he was hired because of his ties to the organization during his playing days as well as for intangible qualities such as his presence as a leader he became known as one who lends support rather than lists his players flaws especially with the media fans and media have questioned his tactical skills but due to his experience playing a position catcher that imputes the requirement for leadership it further increased his potential as an effective managerial figure however with the success of his first two seasons it became apparent matheny was a good choice to manage the cardinals said former cardinal and veteran lance berkman people make a big deal out of not having coached or managed  you can take a guy with no people skills no leadership ability let him manage in the minor leagues for  years and hell never be ready to manage at the major league level and you can take a guy that has all of the intangibles put him in the big leagues and he can be a hall of fame manager matheny subscribes to the theory of servant leadership one central tenet of which is to be accessible and to enable ones subordinates to flourish by setting an example and inspiring rather than through scolding them in one of his blogs matheny posed a question to parents of youth baseball players about whether yelling at their children was helping them to improve well before becoming manager matheny queried corporate executives not connected with baseball on leadership topics matheny is also known to regularly stay in contact with his players the cardinals hiring of matheny – a former catcher lacking in professional managing or coaching experience but one whose leadership qualities had long been apparent – was repeatedly regarded as a reference point for the detroit tigers hiring of brad ausmus for their managerial position late in  similarly ausmus replaced a
