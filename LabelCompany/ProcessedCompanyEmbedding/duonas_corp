fail to raise sufficient capital when needed we will not be able to complete our business plan as a result we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your investment you should consider our independent registered public accountant’s comments when determining if an investment in duonas corp is suitable we are dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations in the decorative business we need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the “plan of operation” section of this prospectus as of june   we had cash in the amount of  and liabilities of  as of this date we have no income and just recently started our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us        we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from vladyslav beinars our sole officer and director who has agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however mr beinars has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company after one year we may need additional financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need additional funding to pay for ongoing sec filing requirements we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future we were incorporated on september   and have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any additional operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail we face strong competition from larger and well established companies which could harm our business and ability to operate profitably our industry is competitive there are many different concept interior decor companies in croatia and our services are not unique to their services even though the industry is highly fragmented it has a number of large and well established companies which are profitable and have developed a brand name for example industrial republic and ikaria aggressive marketing tactics implemented by our competitors could impact our limited financial resources and adversely affect our ability to compete in our market the interior decor industry might be affected by general economic decline and this could adversely affect our operating results and could lead to lower revenues than expected the concept interior decor industry might be affected by general economic decline we expect that this could adversely affect our operating results and could lead to lower revenues than expected if economic situation does not change for better        we expect our products to be subject to changes in customer taste the markets for our products are subject to changing customer tastes and the need to create and market new products demand for products targeting lifestyle tastes and choice is influenced by the popularity of certain themes cultural and demographic trends marketing and advertising expenditures and general economic conditions because these factors can change rapidly customer demand also can shift quickly some goods appeal to customers for only a limited time the success of new product introductions depends on various factors including product selection and quality sales and marketing efforts timely production and delivery and customer acceptance we may not always be able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in customer taste and demand due to the amount of time and financial resources that may be required to bring new products to market the inability to respond quickly to market changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations because we will order our raw materials for production from overseas a disruption in the delivery of imported products may have a greater effect on us than on our competitors we will import our raw materials from china therefore we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who product andor warehouse products in local countries deliveries of our raw materials may be disrupted through factors such as ·          container shortages ·          fuel price increases ·          raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest ·          problems with ocean shipping including work stoppages and shipping ·          increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments and ·          economic crises international disputes and wars some of our competitors warehouse products they import from overseas which allow them to continue delivering their products for the near term despite overseas shipping disruptions if our competitors are able to deliver products when we cannot our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers to our competitors our revenue and profitability may be negatively affected by advances in technology that creates alternate forms of interior decor the interior decor industry in particular continues to undergo significant changes primarily due to technological developments due to this rapid growth of technology we cannot accurately predict the overall effect that such changes may have on the potential revenue from and profitability of company’s services any future changes in technology may change the way we operate our business and add unforeseen costs to our business          because our principal assets are located outside of the united states and vladyslav beinars our sole director and officer resides outside of the united states it may be difficult for an investor to enforce any right based on us federal securities laws against us andor mr beinars or to enforce a judgment rendered by a united states court against us or mr beinars our principal operations and assets are located outside of the united states and vladyslav beinars our sole officer and director is a nonresident of the united states therefore it may be difficult to effect service of process on mr beinars in the united states and it may be difficult to enforce any judgment rendered against mr beinars as a result it may be difficult or impossible for an investor to bring an action against mr beinars in the event that an investor believes that such investor’s rights have been infringed under the us securities laws or otherwise even if an investor is successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of republic of croatia may render that investor unable to enforce a judgment against the assets of mr beinars as a result our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management director or major shareholder compared to shareholders of a corporation doing business and whose officers and directors reside within the united states additionally because of our assets are located outside of the united states they will be outside of the jurisdiction of united states courts to administer if we become subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding as a result if we declare bankruptcy or insolvency our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the united states under united states bankruptcy laws our internal controls may be inadequate      which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results which could harm our business and the market value of our common shares effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud we may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  will require us to continue to evaluate and to report on our internal controls over financial reporting we cannot be certain that we will be successful in continuing to maintain adequate control over our financial reporting and financial processes furthermore if our business grows our internal controls will become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective additionally the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations this activity could prevent us from attracting enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause us to cease operations vladyslav beinars our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations he will be devoting approximately  hours a week to our operations because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at time which is convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations but our sole officer and director vladyslav beinars has agreed to commit more time to our operations as required if the company’s operations grow and require more of his participation        key management personnel may leave the company which could adversely affect the ability of the company to continue operations the company is entirely dependent on the efforts of its sole officer and director the company does not have an employment agreement in place with its sole officer and director his departure or the loss of any other key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on the business there is no guarantee that replacement personnel if any will help the company to operate profitably the company does not maintain key person life insurance on its sole officer and director our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we have never operated as a public company vladyslav beinars our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs acts we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements  we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive’s compensation to median employee compensation in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period even if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth company we may still be in certain circumstances subject to scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company for example smaller reporting companies like emerging growth companies are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under item b of regulation sk or auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting        until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile any additional funding we arrange through the sale of our common stock will result in dilution to existing shareholders we must raise additional capital in order for our business plan to succeed our most likely source of additional capital will be through the sale of additional shares of common stock such stock issuances will cause stockholders’ interests in our company to be diluted such dilution will negatively affect the value of an investor’s shares risks associated with this offering our offering is being made on a best efforts basis with no minimum amount of shares required to be sold for the offering to proceed in order to implement our business plan we require funds from this offering we require a minimum of  from the offering to implement your business plan however our offering is being made on a best efforts basis with no minimum amount of shares required to be sold for the offering to proceed if we raise only a nominal amount of proceeds we may be unable to implement our business plan and we will have to suspend or cease operations and you may lose your investment in our company because the company has arbitrarily set the offering price  you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the company’s shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective criteria of value additionally as the company was formed on september   and has only a limited operating history and no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock our president mr beinars does not have any prior experience offrering and selling securities and our offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment mr beinars does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of losing your entire investment in us we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in selling at least half of the shares and we receive the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan        the trading in our shares will be regulated by the securities and exchange commission rule g which established the definition of a “penny stock” the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board “otcbb” the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between duonas corp and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all the estimated cost of this registration statement is  we will have to utilize funds from vladyslav beinars our sole officer and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process however mr beinars has no obligation to loan such funds to us and there is no guarantee that he will loan such funds to us after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board        because we are a “shell company” the holders of our restricted securities will not be able to sell their securities in reliance on rule  until we cease being a “shell company”   we are a “shell company” as the applicable federal securities law defines that term specifically because of the nature and amount of our assets our limited operations history and limited revenues pursuant to applicable federal rules we are considered a “shell company” applicable provisions of rule  specify that during that time that we are a “shell company” holders of our restricted securities cannot sell those securities in reliance on rule  another implication of us being a “shell company” is that we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act using a form s a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee benefit plan for us to cease being a “shell company” we must have more than nominal operations and more that nominal assets or assets which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents forward looking statements this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as “anticipate” “believe” “plan” “expect” “future” “intend” and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements investors should be aware that all forwardlooking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by us as described in the “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus use of proceeds our offering is being made on a selfunderwritten and “bestefforts” basis no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the raising of   and  respectively of the securities offered for sale by the company there is no assurance that we will raise the full  as anticipated gross proceeds       offering expenses       net proceeds       establishing an office       website development       equipment purchase       raw materials       worker’s salary       marketing and advertising       additional expenses       sec reporting and compliance              the above figures represent only estimated costs if necessary vladyslav beinars our president and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process also these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the overthecounter bulletin board however mr beinars has no obligation to loan such funds to us and that there is no guarantee that he will loan such funds to us mr beinars will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering there is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by mr beinars mr beinars will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate additional revenues to pay the obligation determination of offering price we have determined the offering price of the shares arbitrarily the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities dilution the price of the current offering is fixed at  per share this price is significantly higher than the price paid by the company’s officer for common equity since the company’s inception on september   vladyslav beinars the company’s sole officer and director paid  per share for the  shares of common stock she purchased from the company on april   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders the following sections compare the differences between our future investor’s investment in our shares and the investment of our existing stockholders as of june   the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was  or

total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of

primorjegorski kotar croatia   our phone number is   we have generated no revenue to date of this prospectus our full business plan entails activities described in the plan of operation section below long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business the exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion we do not currently have planned our expansion and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need additional funding at the end of the twelvemonth period described in our “plan of operation” below to maintain a reporting status        our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is a doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills as of the date of this prospectus the company has generated limited revenues of  from selling our decorative items to decoric ltd our first customer the agreement for sale of goods with them is filed as exhibit  to this registration statement which this prospectus is a part  to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering we believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to continue our proposed operations but we cannot guarantee that once we continue operations we will stay in business after doing so if we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering it will last one year but we may need more funds for business operations in the next year and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money plan of operation after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the securities and exchange commissions we intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period our operations will be limited due to

certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” the term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock state securities  blue sky laws there is no established public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that any market will develop in the foreseeable future transfer of our common stock may also be restricted under the securities or securities regulations laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions commonly referred to as “blue sky” laws absent compliance with such individual state laws our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions  because the securities registered hereunder have not been registered for resale under the blue sky laws of any state the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state bluesky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to sell the securities and of purchasers liquidate their investments and should be prepared to hold the common stock for an indefinite period of time in order to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states the securities will be offered or sold in those only if they have been registered or qualified for sale an exemption from such registration or if qualification requirement is available and with which duonas corp has complied in addition and without limiting the foregoing the company will be subject to applicable provisions rules and regulations under the exchange act with regard to security transactions during the period of time when this registration statement is effective        description of securities general our authorized capital

with our common stock the holders of our common stock currently have i equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available therefore when as and if declared by the board of directors of the company ii are entitled to share ratably in all of the assets of the company available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the company iii do not have preemptive subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions or rights applicable thereto and iv are entitled to one noncumulative vote per share on all matters on which stock holders may vote please refer to the company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of the company’s securities preferred stock we do not have an authorized class of preferred stock warrants we have not issued and do not have any outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock options we have not issued and do not have any outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock convertible securities we have not issued and do not have any outstanding securities convertible into shares of our common stock or any rights convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock nevada antitakeover laws the nevada business corporation law contains a provision governing “acquisition of controlling interest” this law provides generally that any person or entity that acquires  or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publiclyheld nevada corporation in the secondary public or private market may be denied voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested stockholders of the corporation elects to restore such voting rights in whole or in part the control share acquisition act provides that a person or entity acquires “control shares” whenever it acquires shares that but for the operation of the control share acquisition act would bring its voting power within any of the following three ranges   to      to  or  more than  a “control share acquisition” is generally defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of either ownership or voting power associated with issued and outstanding control shares the stockholders or board of directors of a corporation may elect to exempt the stock of the corporation from the provisions of the control share acquisition act through adoption of a provision to that effect in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not exempt our common stock from the control share acquisition act the control share acquisition act is applicable only to shares of “issuing corporations” as defined by the act an issuing corporation is a nevada corporation which  has  or more stockholders with at least  of such stockholders being both stockholders of record and residents of nevada and  does business in nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation        at this time we do not have  stockholders of record resident of nevada therefore the provisions of the control share acquisition act do not apply to acquisitions of our shares and will not until such time as these requirements have been met at such time as they may apply to us the provisions of the control share acquisition act may discourage companies or persons interested in acquiring a significant interest in or control of the company regardless of whether such acquisition may be in the interest of our stockholders the nevada “combination with interested stockholders statute” may also have an effect of delaying or making it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company this statute prevents an “interested stockholder” and a resident domestic nevada corporation from entering into a “combination” unless certain conditions are met the statute defines “combination” to include any merger or consolidation with an “interested stockholder” or any sale lease exchange mortgage pledge transfer or other disposition in one transaction or a series of transactions with an “interested stockholder” having  an aggregate market value equal to  percent or more of the aggregate market value of the assets of the corporation  an aggregate market value equal to  percent or more of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the corporation or  representing  percent or more of the earning power or net income of the corporation an “interested stockholder” means the beneficial owner of  percent or more of the voting shares of a resident domestic corporation or an affiliate or associate thereof a corporation affected by the statute may not engage in a “combination” within three years after the interested stockholder acquires its shares unless the combination or purchase is approved by the board of directors before the interested stockholder acquired such shares if approval is not obtained then after the expiration of the threeyear period the business combination may be consummated with the approval of the board of directors or a majority of the voting power held by disinterested stockholders or if the consideration to be paid by the interested stockholder is at least equal to the highest of  the highest price per share paid by the interested stockholder within the three years immediately preceding the date of the announcement of the combination or in the transaction in which he became an interested stockholder whichever is higher  the market value per common share on the date of announcement of the combination or the date the interested stockholder acquired the shares whichever is higher or  if higher for the holders of preferred stock the highest liquidation value of the preferred stock the effect of nevada’s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of duonas corp from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors currently we have no nevada shareholders and since this offering will not be made in the state of nevada no shares will be sold to its residents further we do not do business in nevada directly or through an affiliate corporation and we do not intend to do so accordingly there are no antitakeover provisions that have the affect of delaying or preventing a change in our control dividend policy we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain future earnings if any to finance the expansion of our business as a result we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future indemnification        under our articles of incorporation and bylaws of the corporation we may indemnify an officer or

been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern  however the company had no revenues from september   inception through june   the company is currently in development stage and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time therefore there is substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern management anticipates that the company will be dependent for the near future on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses the company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets in light of management’s efforts there are no assurances that the company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern   note  – summary of signifcant accounting policies   basis of presentation the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america the company’s yearend is june    use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents the company had  of cash from september   inception throughas of june   and  of cash as of june   the company had no cash equivalents as of june   and  respectively   depreciation amortization and capitalization the company records depreciation and amortization when appropriate using straightline balance method over the estimated useful life of the assets the company establish capitalization of its assets based on dollar amount that are more than  in value expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred additions major renewals and replacements that increase the propertys useful life are capitalized property sold or retired together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriated accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income   inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is principally determined using the firstin first out fifo method the company had  in inventory as of june   and  in inventory as of june       f        duonas corp notes to the financial statements june   and june     fair value of financial instruments as topic  fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market   these tiers include   level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions   the carrying value of cash and the company’s loan from shareholder approximates its fair value due to their shortterm maturity   income taxes income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method  under the asset and liability method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws  a valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that based on available evidence are not expected to be realized   basic income loss per share the company computes income loss per share in accordance with fasb asc  “earnings per share” basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted income loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period  dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive for the period from september   inception to june   and as of june   there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding    recent accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company   in march  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no  compensation – stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting this guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of sharebased payments to employees among other things under the new guidance companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paidincapital “apic” but will instead record such items as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and apic pools will be eliminated companies will apply this guidance prospectively another component of the new guidance allows companies to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for sharebased payment awards whereby forfeitures can be estimated as required today or recognized when they occur if elected the change to recognize forfeitures when they occur needs to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach all of the guidance will be effective for the company in the fiscal year beginning october   early adoption is permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance if any on its financial statements and related disclosures   in february  the fasb issued asu  leases topic  which issued new guidance related to leases that outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model and supersedes the current lease guidance the new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets for all leases with lease terms of greater than  months it also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements the new guidance must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective for the company in the fiscal year beginning october   early adoption is permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance if any on its financial statements and related disclosures f        duonas corp notes to the financial statements june   and june     in july  the fasb issued asu no  inventory topic  simplifying the measurement of inventory the guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation rather than the lower of cost or market in the previous guidance this amendment applies to inventory that is measured using firstin firstout fifo this amendment is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those years a reporting entity should apply the amendments prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance if any on its financial statements and related disclosures   in may  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers “asu ” which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers asu  will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective in july  the fasb deferred the effective date of the standard by an additional year however it provided companies the option to adopt one year earlier commensurate with the original effective date accordingly the standard will be effective for the company in the fiscal year beginning october   with an option to adopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning october   the company is currently evaluating this standard and has not yet selected a transition method or the effective date on which it plans to adopt the standard nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its financial statements and related disclosures   note

recognized no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits   as of june   the company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  that may be available to reduce future years’ taxable income in varying amounts through  future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly the company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carryforwards       f          duonas corp notes to the financial statements june   and june     the valuation allowance at june   was approximately  the net change in valuation allowance during the year ended june   was  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment based on consideration of these items management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of june    all tax years since inception remains open for
