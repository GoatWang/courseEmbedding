of which there is no assurance proceeds of this offering may be insufficient to enable us to conduct potentially profitable operations or otherwise to engage in any business endeavors the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the expenses difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the formation of any new business since the incorporation of gisser

acceptable to us business the company builds the mec americas first independent handbuilt highperformance midengine superexotic sports coupe our mission is to design engineer and manufacture the mec superexotic luxury sports coupes to be highly marketable while satisfying the ongoing demands of discriminating and affluent sophisticated sports car enthusiasts the mecs price positioning limited production should enable the company to gain a strategic market niche and inturn create a backlog of orders the company is striving to become an independent highperformance automobile designer and manufacturer of midengine superexotic handbuilt vehicles for the superluxury and ultraluxury market segments we have designed and engineered our superexotic luxury sports coupe to be highly marketable and saleable to a maximum number of discriminating and affluent automobile buyers   a fiberglass reinforced plastic body was employed rather than other materials due to its versatility and conformity in the complex and compound curves which comprise the unique style of the mec since the mec is based on a modular rolling chassis the body is completely unstressed by any demands of the vehicles structural rigidity and therefore may remain lightweight this allowed liberal distribution of the vehicles total weight toward optimizing the structural rigidity and versatility of the chassis most classes of professional competition employ the very same configuration in their race car designs for state of the art performance and safety competition the gac is positioning the mec as an exclusive superexotic automobile that appeals to the affluent sophisticated buyer whose market can best be described as wealthy and knowledgeable about highperformance automobiles the company believes that its strategy of pricing the mec superexotic sports coupe at  will give it an advantage in the market and places its vehicle in a category with few direct competitors yet potentially many ready consumers by exhibiting the better performance and styling features of higher priced exoticsuperluxury automobiles the mec would be a superior value when placed alongside any other ultraluxuryprestige sports coupe in the lower priced market additional models will be offered over the spectrum of the market segment starting at  current financial resources we have engaged in no significant operations other than organizational activities acquisition of capital and preparation for registration of our securities under the securities exchange act of  as amended no revenues were received by us since our formation for the current fiscal year we anticipate incurring a loss as a result of organizational expenses expenses associated with registration under the securities exchange act of  and other expenses dependence on the rate of growth of the company is somewhat additional financing dependent upon the successful completion of this offering to commence its proposed plan of operation and the company may need additional financing to fund its corporate activities such financing may come from a variety of sources including additional equity or debt offerings no assurance can be given that any future financing either equity or debt will be available or if available that it can be obtained on terms acceptable to the company if such financing is required but is not available the company may be forced to significantly restrict curtail or abandon its activities this would have an adverse effect on the companys business and financial condition there can also be no assurance that the company will survive as a viable commercial enterprise even if such additional financing is obtained the issuance of any additional equity after the consummation of this offering will dilute the ownership interests of the shareholders who purchase shares in this offering see proposed additional transactions and risk factors  dilution   we believe that our existing capital will be sufficient to meet our cash needs including the costs of compliance with the continuing reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended for a period of approximately one year no commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management or other stockholders accordingly there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available to us to allow it to cover our expenses irrespective of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs we might seek to compensate providers of services by issuances of stock in lieu of cash risk profile an

offered hereby such purchases shall be made for investment purposes only and in a manner consistent with a public offering of our shares such purchases may be used to reach the amount required for closing in the event such amount is not reached as a result of purchases by the general public thus the officers and directors could purchase up to  of the amount required for closing if no sales are made to new shareholders such purchases will increase the equity interests already owned by the officers and directors investors should carefully review the financial statements which are an integral part of this prospectus dealers participating in this offering are required to deliver a copy of the final prospectus to any person who is expected to receive a confirmation of the sale at least  hours prior to the mailing of the confirmation risk factors the securities offered hereby are highly speculative and involve substantial risks you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this prospectus before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock any of the following risks could cause the value of our common stock to decline our financial status creates a doubt whether we will continue as a going concern for more than  months from the date of this prospectus and if we do not continue as a going concern investors may lose their entire investment we have nominal assets and limited operations with which to create operating capital we seek to raise additional capital to promote and advertise our services in an offering of our common stock on form s if all the shares offered are sold we will receive up to  proceeds net of expenses to purchase material and equipment to build the prototype there can be no assurance that such offering will be successful   we are a development stage company that has a very limited operating history we never earned any revenues and we may never achieve or sustain profitability at october   we had shareholders equity of  and a working capital deficit of  we were incorporated on may   and since then our only operations have consisted of research and development and the building of prototypes of our midengine superexotic sports coupe the mec we have not yet commenced the commercial sale of our product and have no revenues to date we have absolutely no track record upon which you can evaluate an investment in our shares we have a limited operating history and very limited indications of product acceptability upon which an evaluation of our proposed business can be based our ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon a number of factors including our ability to become a successful market entrant our ability to effectively manufacture market and distribute our mec in commercial quantities our ability to expand our product base in the future and our ability to successfully market and sell our products furthermore our revenues expenses and cash flow cannot be predicted with any certainty our expenses will be variable based on market conditions and the number of vehicles sold we only have  in cash as of october   and if we are unable to raise more money we will be required to delay scale back or eliminate key elements of our business plan as of october   we had  in cash available to fund our operations our cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant we anticipate based on our present operating plan and assumptions that the maximum proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least  calendar months however the shares that are being offered by us under this prospectus are being offered on a best efforts basis so we may not be able to sell the maximum number or any particular number of shares in this offering and the net proceeds from any shares sold may not be sufficient to allow us to accomplish our business objectives further if we are unable to raise any significant funds in this offering we will likely be required to seek additional capital from other sources in the future through additional equity or debt financing or credit facilities any additional equity financing that we obtain will likely involve substantial dilution to our shareholders and any debt financing would increase the cost of our debt service requirements it will be difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future on acceptable terms or at all to date we have made attempts to identify possible sources for funding but have no commitments for any future funding the type timing and terms of such funding if it is available at all will be determined by prevailing conditions in the financial markets and our financial condition among other factors if we cannot obtain the financing we need we may have to significantly curtail or reduce our operations risks relating to our business we may experience significant returns or warranty claims which would damage our brand increase our costs and impair our ability to achieve profitability currently the mec is not available for purchase by the general public as a result we have no meaningful data regarding the performance or maintenance requirements of our product or any basis on which we can estimate warranty costs if we are subject to significant warranty service requirements or product recalls potential customers may determine that our vehicles are unreliable and may choose not to purchase them further significant warranty service requirements will result in increased costs to us as a result of the costs of repair or replacement of our products and the costs associated with researching and developing solutions to issues raised by warranty claims any significant warranty service requirements or product recalls would increase our costs materially and reduce the value of our brand significantly   the marketing and sale of our products will be subject to significant competition and most if not all of our competitors are better capitalized and much more experienced than us our superexotic automobiles compete in a segment of the automotive market which is highly competitive in style and price the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our product include product quality appearance design price and distribution capabilities we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors based on these and other factors most of our current and potential business competitors in ultra and superluxury market segments have achieved a higher level of brand recognition than us have longer operating histories than us and significantly greater financial technical production distribution marketing and other resources than us and could decide at any time to increase their resource commitments in our planned markets our competitors include well known companies such as jaguar porsche ferrari mercedes and bmw it is possible that existing or future business competitors will develop programs that would significantly impact our ability to compete in our intended market niche we do not currently have a distribution channel for the sales of our vehicle and we may not be able to obtain a good distribution channel in the future we intend to market our product line through direct sales and the establishment of independent sales representatives on a national and international basis we do not have any contractual arrangements with any sales andor authorized service representatives our inability to contract with such sales and service representatives will have a material adverse impact on the sales of our mec and future products moreover even if we are able to reach an agreement with an independent sales representative we cant be sure that it will be on economic terms that are satisfactory to us or that the sales representatives will be able to successfully develop sales of our product and future products our operations may become subject to significant governmental regulations in the future we are in the business of manufacturing motor vehicles automobile manufacturers that build vehicles for sale in the united states are regulated by the us environmental protection agency and the us department of transportation which among their regulations include environmental and licensing law requirements although we are a low volume manufacturer that is not governed by the same regulations as mass manufacturers and we utilize components from oems and aftermarket suppliers that have been approved by both agencies for use there can be no assurance that these regulations will not change in the future additionally we may in the future and for undetermined reasons need to use other components that have not yet been approved for use other than racing or that are not intended for use on normal highways and roads existing governmental regulations andor the adoption of new laws regulations or policies relating to the environment safety emissions andor fuel economy may have a significant impact on how we do business as well as possible higher costs cash expenditures andor sales restrictions we and the automotive industry as a whole are governed by and affected significantly by a substantial number of governmental regulations which vary by state region and country in our primary market the united states governmental regulation has arisen primarily out of concern for the environment vehicle safety and the desire to increase fuel economy in the future these government regulatory requirements may also complicate our plans for global product development and expansion and may result in substantial expenses that could be unacceptable to our consumers costs may exceed  for crash tests and the necessary approvals from the department of transportation dot in addition to the cost of any vehicles to be tested meeting or exceeding the government mandated safety standards is particularly costly since crashworthiness tends to conflict with weight reduction goals in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards other compliance issues with the environmental protection agency epa are not believed to be costly since our business plans include using epa tested and approved power plants that are already in production part of our plans in bringing our vehicles into production was to use as many off the shelf or approved components thereby reducing or eliminating costs for governmental testing and new approvals in addition any new government requirements that must be complied with during a product cycle can be substantially more expensive than accommodating these requirements prior to the design of a new product   daryl k gisser our chief executive officer has the power to make all major decisions regarding the company without the need to get consent from any stockholder or other person he is also the only person knowledgeable about our business affairs and history and the loss of his services would likely result in the indefinite cessation of our operations and the complete failure of our current business plan daryl gisser owns  of the outstanding common and preferred stock and he is our chief executive officer and the chairman of our board of directors he therefore has the power to appoint and remove directors to make all major decisions regarding our affairs including decisions regarding whether or not to issue stock and for what consideration whether or not to sell all or substantially all of our assets and for what consideration and whether or not to authorize more stock for issuance or otherwise amend our charter or bylaws he is in a position to elect all of our directors and to dictate all of our policies furthermore since mr gisser is our founder no other person affiliated with or employed by us has the same extensive knowledge of our day to day operations or any institutional knowledge regarding our history and past affairs we currently have an employment agreement with mr gisser as well as other certain key employees the loss or inability of mr gisser to perform his duties would likely result in the indefinite cessation of our operations and the complete failure of our current business plan we do currently maintain key man life insurance coverage on daryl k gissers life in the amount of  we do not maintain insurance on the life of our other executives the proceeds from any payout on the insurance on mr gissers life may not be sufficient to allow us to continue operations in the event of his death we anticipate the hiring of new employees in connection with the planned expansion of our business our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to hire and retain key technical sales and senior management personnel competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel market risks no market exists for the trading of our securities and no market may ever develop accordingly you may not have any means of trading the shares you acquire in this offering a market does not presently exist for our securities and no assurance can be given that a market will ever develop consequently you may not be able to liquidate your investment in our securities for an emergency or at any time and the securities will not be readily acceptable as collateral for loans although we may endeavor to establish a trading market for our securities in the future no assurance can be given as to the timing of this event or whether the market if established will be sufficiently liquid to enable an investor to liquidate his investment in us   the application of the penny stock rules could adversely affect the market for our stock the securities and exchange act of  requires additional disclosure relating to the market for penny stocks a penny stock is generally defined to be any equity security not listed on nasdaq or a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions among these exceptions are shares issued by companies that have net tangible assets of at least  million if the issuer has been in continuous operation for three years net tangible assets of at least  million if the issuer has been in continuous operation for less than three years or average annual revenue of at least  million for each of the last three years for our shares and of any sales commissions or other compensation payable to any broker or dealer or any other related person involved in the transaction send monthly statements to buyers disclosing updated price information for any penny stocks held in their accounts and these monthly statements must include specified information on the limited market for penny stocks we do not currently meet the requirements of these exceptions and therefore our shares would be deemed penny stocks for purposes of the exchange act if and at any time while our common stock trades below  per share in such case trading in our shares would be regulated pursuant to rules g through g and g of the exchange act under these rules brokers or dealers recommending our shares to prospective buyers would be required unless an exemption is available to deliver a lengthy disclosure statement in a form designated by the sec relating to the penny stock market to any potential buyers and obtain a written acknowledgement from each buyer that such disclosure statement has been received by the buyer prior to any transaction involving our shares provide detailed written disclosure to buyers of current price quotations in addition if we are subject to the penny stock rules all brokers or dealers involved in a transaction in which our shares are sold to any buyer other than an established customer or accredited investor must make a special written determination that our shares would be a suitable investment for the buyer and the brokers or dealers must receive the buyers written agreement to purchase our shares as well as the buyers written acknowledgement that the suitability determination made by the broker or dealer accurately reflects the buyers financial situation investment experience and investment objectives prior to completing any transaction in our shares these exchange act rules may limit the ability or willingness of brokers and other market participants to make a market in our shares and may limit the ability of our shareholders to sell in the secondary market through brokers dealers or otherwise we also understand that many brokerage firms will discourage their customers from trading in shares falling within the penny stock definition due to the added regulatory and disclosure burdens imposed by these exchange act rules the sec from time to time may propose and implement even more stringent regulatory or disclosure requirements on shares not listed on nasdaq or on a national securities exchange the adoption of the proposed changes that may be made in the future could have an adverse effect on the trading market for our shares   use of proceeds in the table below we have detailed the minimum amount of capital required for us to operate our business as currently planned the table
