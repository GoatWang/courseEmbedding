restructuring and creating a cogeneration and services division which will harness excess of vapor and heat form its industrial operations by lawrence iliff wall street journal may nd  national oil company petróleos mexicanos created a cogeneration unit for electricity production during a meeting of its board of directors friday and shuffled executives at its restructured exploration and production unit the company said the new pemex cogeneration and services division will oversee the harnessing of excess vapor and heat from the oil firm’s industrial operations—especially at refineries—to produce electricity for sale an energy overhaul last year ended pemex’s monopoly on oil production while also opening up the electricity sector which has been dominated by the state utility comision federal de electricidad in wake of the reform pemex plans to go from being the nation’s biggest electricity consumer to becoming a net producer the company has said the pemex board named eleazar gomez zapata as director of the cogeneration unit he previously served as the maintenance coordinator at the corporate operations unit the oil company’s board also voted to restructure its exploration and production unit as the company prepares to compete with private players rather than having one director named by the nation’s president as was standard practice for decades pemex will now have a threeperson committee to divide up those duties with the executives named by the board former exploration and production chief gustavo hernandez was named operations director of the

enters the wholesale electricity market through cogeneration and services  home back to mbp visit mef mexico’s agenda on energy and climate change law of the energy transition is finally here mef pemex enters the wholesale electricity market through cogeneration and services by wallace porter on december   · leave a comment don’t miss out the opportunity  to get the energy leaders insights on the main trends developments and investment opportunities  regarding the mexican energy and sustainability markets conventional power generation systems experience efficiency rates of  while cogeneration systems achieve levels of  pemex’s productive processes require large amounts of electricity and vapor so the oil company benefits greatly from cogeneration systems as they are a key practice for improving efficiency cogeneration systems allow both the reduction in power generation costs by approximately  due to the recovery factor in thermal energy vapor for productive processes as well as the economic benefits brought about by clean energy in the aftermath of the energy reform pemex is undergoing a structural transformation in order to become a productive enterprise of the state pemex has followed a selfsupply electricity strategy over the past few years and it is now undergoing a transition by shifting from fuelbased to natural gas generation in its refineries gas processing facilities and petrochemical complexes by implementing cogeneration plants and obtaining an estimated potential of mw of clean and efficient electricity according to emilio lozoya director general of pemex the parastatal can seize  of the country’s cogeneration potential which would make pemex the second largest generator in the country since  pemex has advanced in the design and execution of a cogeneration strategy to increase efficiency and reliability in its productive processes reduce operational costs guarantee energy selfsufficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions the nuevo pemex cogeneration plant which began operations in  has an installed capacity of mw the electricity it generates is dispatched across the country to cover the power needs of pemex facilities a cogeneration station is being built at the cactus gas processing complex to take advantage of the gas produced in this facility to generate electricity and vapor while subsequent endeavors will work on the tula cadereyta and salina cruz refineries totaling an estimated capacity of mw the energy reform provides pemex the opportunity to participate in the wholesale electricity market by selling electricity surplus resulting from cogeneration activities while also benefiting from operational environmental and economic benefits as part of its corporate transformation pemex decided to create a cogeneration subsidiary pemex cogeneration and services which was formally constituted in june  “pemex’s productive processes are energy intensive and use large amounts of vapor therefore cogeneration is a highly efficient way to cover these needs after the energy reform and once it achieves selfsufficiency in terms of power generation pemex will continue developing new cogeneration projects to sell its excess power in the wholesale market” shares eleazar gómez zapata director of pemex cogeneration and services pemex will definitely not be a latecomer in the wholesale electricity market the company has already moved forward in the design of a cogeneration project portfolio for instance the salina cruz cogeneration plant has an estimated generation capacity of mw of which mw will be used to power the refinery while the remaining power will be dispatched to the wholesale electricity market similarly the tonh of vapor resulting from the process will be used in the ing antonio dovalí jaime refinery the parastatal’s cogeneration subsidiary is working on establishing alliances with third parties to develop projects participating as an industrial partner “our cogeneration projects are currently being developed with international consortia with extensive experience in project development operation and maintenance as well as commercialization” explains gómez zapata at the moment alliances with four consortia for the development of cogeneration plants total an estimated generation capacity of mw and tonh of vapor which should begin operations in the  period mef will focus on a wide range of topics including the development of the wholesale electricity market the future of the energy matrix project development and financing the regulations regarding clean energy certificates opportunities and trends in the natural gas transportation and power generation segments and the development of talent for the electricity industry if you wish to be part of mexico energy forum
