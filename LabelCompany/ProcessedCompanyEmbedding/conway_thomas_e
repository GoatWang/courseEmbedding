email banner blackboard apply visit get involved give inside ecsu directory toggle navigation conway elected chancellor of elizabeth city state university chapel hill nc – thomas e h conway jr who has served as interim chancellor of elizabeth city state university since january   has been elected to the position on a permanent basis by the board of governors of the campus university of north carolina the appointment is effective immediately with the endorsement of the ecsu board of trustees unc interim president junius gonzales placed conway’s name in nomination today january  during a special meeting of the board of governors held in chapel hill  conway who had previously served as vice chancellor and chief of staff at fayetteville state university succeeds stacey franklin jones who stepped down from the post on december  in recommending conway to the board of governors gonzales said  “thomas conway is a proud product of the university of north carolina system and he has devoted his life’s work to it  over the past four decades he has distinguished himself as senior administrator on two other unc campuses and he brings to ecsu a deep understanding of the mission purpose and promise of unc’s historically minority institutions  i am convinced that he is the right individual to lead ecsu for the long haul and that belief has been enthusiastically affirmed by the ecsu board of trustees  dr conway’s knowledge of the region extensive administrative experience and sound judgment will be critical assets as we work together to ensure ecsu’s longterm success  we are most fortunate to retain a proven leader of such talent integrity and commitment” ecsu which serves one of north carolina’s most economically disadvantaged regions has faced a series of enrollment and financial challenges  over the past five years headcount enrollment has declined by more than  and state appropriations and tuition revenues have been reduced by nearly  million or   those losses would have been greater without  million of shortterm stabilization funding provided by the  general assembly contributing factors have included the implementation of tougher unc minimum admissions standards state budget cuts throughout the recession declining tuition revenues and reputational challenges stemming from key operational deficiencies conway  has served as vice chancellor and chief of staff at fayetteville state since   in that role he has had primary responsibility for advancing university priorities and coordinating and implementing the strategic planning process prior to joining fayetteville state’s senior leadership team conway served as dean of undergraduate academic programs at nc state university   in that capacity he worked with faculty and administrators across
