consent order no cos i preliminary statement whereas the banking commissioner �commissioner� is charged with the administration of chapter a of the general statutes of connecticut the connecticut uniform securities act �act� and sections b to b inclusive of the regulations of connecticut state agencies promulgated under the act �regulations�   whereas proequities inc �proequities� of  highway  south birmingham alabama  has been registered as a brokerdealer under the act since august     whereas state regulators from multiple jurisdictions including the securities and business investments division of the state of connecticut department of banking the �division� conducted coordinated investigations of bankers life and casualty company �bankers life� and blc financial services inc crd number  �blcfs� collectively �bankers� to determine whether bankers should have been registered as a brokerdealer and investment adviser between january   and december     whereas the investigations revealed that bankers had acted as a brokerdealer and investment adviser in various jurisdictions without being registered exempt from registration or a federally covered investment adviser and had employed or otherwise engaged agents and investment adviser representatives who were not so registered on behalf of bankers   whereas bankers has engaged in similar conduct in connecticut in violation of section b of the act   whereas proequities entered into an agreement with bankers effective april   to provide brokerage and investment advisory services out of bankers life branch office locations   whereas section ba of the act authorizes the commissioner to order any person who has violated is violating or is about to violate any provision of the act or any regulation rule or order adopted or issued under the act and any person who has materially aided in such violation to cease and desist from such violation and section bd of the act authorizes the commissioner to impose a fine against any person who has violated any provision of the act or any regulation rule or order adopted or issued under the act and against any person who has materially aided in such violation   whereas aiding a violation of the act would also support the initiation of administrative proceedings under section b of the act   whereas an administrative proceeding under sections b and b of the act would constitute a �contested case� within the meaning of section  of the general statutes of connecticut   whereas section c of the general statutes of connecticut and section aa of the regulations of connecticut state agencies provide that a contested case may be resolved by consent order unless precluded by law   whereas section ba of the act provides in relevant part that �the commissioner may from time to time make    such    orders as are necessary to carry out the provisions of sections b to b inclusive�   whereas section bb of the act provides in relevant part that �no    order may be made    unless the commissioner finds that the action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of sections b to b inclusive�   whereas the conduct addressed herein has resulted in no known direct consumer harm and the parties understand that registered agents or representatives of proequities participated in all securities transactions and at locations that were registered with the appropriate securities authorities as brokerdealer locations of proequities   whereas proequities has cooperated with state regulators conducting the investigations by responding to inquiries providing documentary evidence and halting further payment to blcfs of brokerdealer and investment adviser related compensation while the investigations were pending   whereas proequities as part of this settlement agrees to comply with all state and federal licensing registration and other securities laws   whereas proequities in order to avoid protracted and expensive proceedings in numerous states has agreed to resolve the investigations through a multistate settlement which includes this consent order   whereas proequities without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below and solely for the purposes of this consent order admits the jurisdiction of the commissioner voluntarily consents to the entry of this consent order and voluntarily waives the following rights   to be afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing within the meaning of sections bf ba and bd of the act and section a of the general statutes of connecticut  to present evidence and argument and to otherwise avail itself of sections bf ba and bd of the act and section ca of the general statutes of connecticut  to present its position in a hearing in which it is represented by counsel  to have a written record of the hearing made and a written decision issued by a hearing officer and  to seek judicial review of or otherwise challenge or contest the matters described herein including the validity of this consent order   whereas the commissioner finds that the entry of this consent order is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act   now therefore the commissioner hereby enters this consent order ii findings of fact  bankers life is a life insurance company located in illinois that has never been registered as a brokerdealer or investment adviser  blcfs is a whollyowned subsidiary of bankers life that also is located in illinois  blcfs has been a member of nasd or finra since  and is registered as a brokerdealer only in illinois  during its existence blcfs has had no business activity other than as described herein  blcfs has never been registered as a brokerdealer or investment adviser in connecticut and it has not registered any agents or investment adviser agents in connecticut  at all relevant times proequities was a brokerdealer registered under the act and a federally registered investment adviser that made a notice filing with the commissioner pursuant to section be of the act  bankers life and blcfs entered into an agreement with proequities effective april   the �proequities agreement�  the proequities agreement specified that proequities would �exercise exclusive control� over the brokerdealer and investment advisory activities of proequities agents who were also insurance agents for bankers life the �dual agents�  in addition the proequities agreement assigned the following securitiesrelated roles to blcfs or to blcfs and bankers life which roles blcfs and bankers life did perform until december   a    consulting with proequities on the persons to be appointed as representatives of proequities  b    identifying securities product training and marketing opportunities for review by proequities    c     conferring with proequities concerning the securities products made available for distribution by the dual agents      d     terminating the clearing broker selected by proequities blcfs only in the event that the clearing agent did not use commercially reasonable efforts to process and service customer accounts at a level consistent with blcfs� standards    e     paying for advertising and promotional material blcfs only in the event that blcfs ordered more than a reasonable quantity of such materials or required customization of them    f   recruiting representatives for proequities and assisting with the licensing and registration process  g   providing marketing training and support and   h   paying for  i preexamination training for required finra examinations ii sales training materials iii recruitment and travel costs and iv proequities stationery and business cards   under the proequities agreement proequities was required to pay blcfs between  and  of revenue received by proequities for the securities business conducted by the dual agents  proequities also was required to provide reports to blcfs of the amount of compensation to be paid to each dual agent for securities work and blcfs was to retain the difference  blcfs in its current form bd filing lists the following as other business         blc financial services inc blcf provides sales support  a marketing program to bankers life  casualty agents who are securities licensed with proequities  blcfs will receive compensation from proequities based on these securities sales  blcfs will not have any representatives that sell to the public  evidence obtained during the investigation indicated that bankers screened prospective securities agents trained new securities agents conducted some periodic training sessions for securities agents monitored and attempted to increase securities production of securities agents and played a significant role in determining the compensation of securities agents  in addition evidence showed that the involvement of bankers in securitiesrelated roles led to confusion in the reporting and responsibility hierarchies between bankers and proequities  at no time were the dual agents registered as agents or investment adviser agents of bankers life or blcfs  the agents were registered agents and investment adviser agents of proequities  from april   through november   bankers received on a nationwide basis a total of approximately  million from proequities under the proequities agreement for variable annuity and securities transactions and investment advice iii conclusions of law  under section ba of the act a person may not transact business as a brokerdealer in connecticut unless registered  similarly under section bc of the act a person may not transact business as an investment adviser in connecticut unless registered or exempt from registration  section bb of the act prohibits a brokerdealer from employing an agent unless that agent is registered under the act or an associated person who represents a brokerdealer in effecting transactions described in subdivisions
