contact clients who chooses provident investment management most of our clients are regular people and regular families that’s different from many other investment advisors who prefer dealing with big institutional accounts it’s always been that way here ever since ralph and maury opened up shop with a single client in  today provident investment management has nearly  client relationships for whom we manage over  accounts our clients come from all over the country many also managed their own investments for years before hiring provident so they could focus on leisure or other activities in retirement what types of investors choose provident investment management investors who want capital growth investors who need to strike the right balance between maximizing returns and being smart about taxes investors who want individual stocks and bonds not just a heap of funds investors who expect to be able to talk to their money manager whenever they need to not just by appointment investors who think money managers should work in an office not on a golf course why do they choose provident investment management for our professional expertise all our portfolio managers are chartered financial analysts for our proven record most firms try to hide their performance results we like to lead with ours you should insist on seeing five or ten years of performance data from a firm before you choose view our investment performance for peace of mind our firm has been here since  and we have a demonstrated record of investment success we’ve survived the bubbles the market fads the economic dips and the crises for our style most firms specialize in growth or value investing but provident looks for the synthesis of both many larger firms exclusively invest their clients’ money in largecapitalization stocks while we’ll buy big companies when we think we see an opportunity the best opportunities are usually found in smaller undertheradar firmsso that’s where we prefer to tread back to top becoming a client one of our senior portfolio managers speaks with every prospective client to establish goals and expectations and to determine the suitability of investing with us once you become a provident client we build you an individual portfolio of highquality growth stocks purchased with a value discipline we can also manage the fixedincome portion of your portfolio using individual municipal bonds we manage any combination of taxable and nontaxable accounts including trusts as well as traditional and roth iras beginning with a new client usually involves managing them out of some holdings they bring to us we pay attention to tax considerations however while not financial planners we work with you to establish your objectives and combine accounts together to meet one or more purposes including retirement or estate planning needs by treating all of your accounts as a combined portfolio it becomes easier for you to see how the portfolio is meeting your objectives each “combined portfolio” can typically be expected to hold roughly  to  stocks these stocks are chosen from different industries and market capitalizations to gain the benefits of reduced volatility through diversification we do not purchase mutual funds unless you are looking to invest cash shortterm to gain market exposure in which case we may buy an etf that mimics a market index like the sp  over time we sell the etf and purchase stocks that fit our criteria we are longterm investors who do not try to “time” the market through rapid buys and sells so typically our turnover is only  to  in any one year by holding many stocks for a number of years we allow our companies to realize their growth potential which should be rewarded with higher share

outperformed the sp  index since  and has been named one of the world’s best money managers by nelson investment management network our personal money management approach sets the gold standard for investment results through research we look forward to discussing how our investment management expertise can increase your wealth please contact us today equities research there are thousands of publiclytraded stocks but relatively few truly superior businesses our growthoriented and valuedisciplined approach to stock selection begins by screening for companies that have a successful track record of growing their sales and earnings and whose stock values leave room for future earnings growth to lead to further stock appreciation we expect the companies we buy and hold for our clients to demonstrate good cash flow characteristics management should demonstrate its commitment to a singular vision and that vision should be combined with the company’s commitment to the interests of its shareholders when a company that meets our growth and value characteristics comes along we follow it closely looking for any evidence for or against our thesis that the company has attractive prospects for investors a company that demonstrates consistently impressive performance will likely eventually be promoted to “portfolio company” meaning that we begin purchasing shares for client accounts our entire investment team monitors portfolio companies on a daytoday weektoweek and quartertoquarter basis for signs of weakness or for superior opportunities sell discipline when portfolio companies show signs of trouble we react quickly to any new information that becomes available and then act according to our reading of the situation by following companies closely over time we develop a familiarity with the business and management that hones our ability to interpret new developments sometimes a situation weakens gradually over time and we are faced with a decision whether to be patient and allow the company and its industry to return to form or move along to the best stock we have to “challenge” the incumbent holding tax considerations as well as general market conditions can affect the timing of our buy and sell decisions longterm track record the true sign of an expert money manager is not the ability to outperform the market in any one given year instead the real proof is in outperforming the market consistently over a long period of time our firm has consistently outperformed the sp  index since  back to top fixed income your total returns and your investments’ comprehensive risk profile are the two most important considerations in our approach to personal money management we believe other investment managers typically over allocate clients to bonds in doing so they introduce substantial inflation risk as well as the possibility of capital losses if interest rates begin to rise despite these risks however fixed income can still have a place in an investor’s portfolio the municipal bond market can offer some excellent opportunities for taxsensitive investors we perform our own research and we work to find uncommon opportunities trading at

consultants we keep all our investment research and portfolio management inhouse provident clients never pay for “softdollar” compensation arrangements we earn our fee by practicing personal money

what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund industry – assets under management usd billions

provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha managed funds which do are a good way
