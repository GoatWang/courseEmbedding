wealth advisors all rights reserved hbks wealth advisors   our perspectives awards andrecognition press releases our perspectives tax loss harvesting turning losses into gains     matthew costigan cfp® cpapfs sometimes even stocks that lose value can make you money or at least save you money in the form of very real tax savings as a cpa as well as a financial advisor i look at investing from several different perspectives with the overall goal of enhancing bottomline returns for my clients one of the most significant opportunities comes as the yearend approaches and i immerse myself in the art and science of tax planning most people with an investment portfolio find at yearend a substantial tax burden due to realized gains be they short or longterm gains realized gains dont add to the value of your portfolio or put cash in your pocket but they are nonetheless real and more importantly taxable at up to  percent they come in several varieties but the two most frequently encountered are gains from stocks that rose in value during the year and were sold at a profit over the investment cost and distributions from mutual funds which almost all mutual funds make at the end of each year realized gains are an annual ritual even in years when the overall value of your portfolio declines but even in years when your portfolio has soared there are always going to be some stocks or mutual funds that decline in value you might consider these losers but they also provide opportunities to offset or at least diminish the tax impact of your gains here are a few sell off your losses this is the most simplistic solution we look for stocks or mutual funds we can sell at losses to offset the winners dollar for dollar we can buy the same investments back at a later date but you might also use the opportunity to reposition your portfolio to some extent buybacks must accommodate the irss washsale rule typically you have to wait  days  in some instances to take the loss sometimes you can get around the washsale rule by using an etf to make a tax swap such as an etf for a stock or mutual fund or for another etf if the two are linked to different indexes sell off more of your losses you can deduct up to  of capital losses from other noninvestment income your ordinary income and if you can zero out your taxable income and have losses left over you can carry them forward to offset capital gains or ordinary income the following year have your gains and pay no taxes if you are in a  percent or lower tax bracket including your capital gains irs statutes forgive all taxes on longterm capital gains thats right zero federal tax on your longterm capital gains employing this strategy requires care because the gains you take might impact other deductions like healthcare expenditures its another aspect of our hbks tax planning process socalled tax loss harvesting is not always the best way to deal with capital gains you might not want to disturb the balance of your portfolio even for  days or you might miss a rally in the issues that you are harvesting losses from regardless from choosing investments to selling investments decisions should always be made with an eye to your individual bottomline value and that always involves considering the tax implications   investment advisory services are offered through hbk sorce advisory llc doing

christopher n sorce cfp® history has shown that it is nearly impossible to determine what the numbers will be tomorrow much less next month or next year we are often asked where we believe a certain market or economic indicator is headed stocks bonds interest rates or gross domestic product — no one can consistently and accurately predict what the future will bring including the “renowned experts” who want us to believe otherwise the fact is history has shown that it is nearly impossible to determine what the numbers will be tomorrow much less next month or next year while we understand the desire for forecasts that purport to say where for example stocks will be by the end of this year such predictions at best provide only a false sense of certainty at worst they can do severe damage to an investors longterm financial objectives to illustrate the point look how some infamous recent predictions fared legendary vanguard founder jack bogle should have known better he has often stated that no one knows where the market is headed still in an interview with forbes magazine he said he expected average returns in the domestic stock market to be “about  percent annually” from  to  the sp  index was actually down about  percent annually over that decade according to the board of governors of the federal reserve system during testimony on march   federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said “the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained” then bernanke told the house financial services committee in july  that “the gses governmentsponsored enterprises are adequately capitalized they are in no danger of failing” of course neither of these statements turned out to be accurate and the nation suffered the worst financial meltdown since the great depression on october th of  jim cramer while live on the “today” television show said “i thought about this all weekend i do not want to say these things on tv whatever money you may need for the next five years please take it out of the stock market right now this week i do not believe that you should risk those assets in the stock market right now” if an investor sold out of an sp  index fund the next day he or she would have missed out on a rebound of  percent over the next five years on march   while on cnbcs “squawk box” entrepreneur t boone pickens predicted the price of a barrel of oil would rebound to  by the end of the year the barrel price of crude oil ended  at  these are just a few examples of recognized experts making predictions that turn out to be drastically wrong there are many many more even the people who make their living forecasting markets are usually wrong in january of each year cnnmoney conducts a survey of  to  investment strategists and money managers to gauge what they believe the performance of the sp  index will be that year here are the results for the past five years along with the actual performance of the sp  index for each year the investment strategists and money managers missed the mark by an average of about  percent per year the largest miss came in  in january of that year many investors were very nervous about the prospects for stocks there were concerns about the high valuation of the stock market the potential for inflation to heat up the level of debt the u s government had accumulated due to loose monetary policies after the financial crisis the european sovereign debt crisis and slower growth in emerging markets yet the sp  index rocketed over  percent higher this is not to say those of us in the investment community lack intelligence the world in which we live is just highly unpredictable the hbks investment team recognizes that in a highly unpredictable environment it is foolish to predict instead we focus on what we can reasonably expect we can reasonably expect a certain level of dividends and interest income we can reasonably expect the stock market to trend upward over the long term by focusing on what we can reasonably expect hbks wealth advisors does not rely on nearterm market forecasting in managing client portfolios our solution is to develop with each one of our clients a prudent globally diversified asset allocation designed for the long term with the targeted asset allocation determined we can view bouts of volatility as opportunities to rebalance the asset allocation back to our targets during periods of market stress our advice is to stay the course and focus on the long term instead of obsessing over the daily news we believe substantial movement up or down in an asset class can be an opportunity to rebalance your portfolio to take advantage of the eventual move in the opposite direction income diversification asset allocation and rebalancing might lack the excitement of the predictions of the socalled experts but focusing on reasonable expectations and longterm performance seems to us a better approach than trying to guess which turn the markets will take next   the information included in this document is for general informational purposes only it does not contain any investment
