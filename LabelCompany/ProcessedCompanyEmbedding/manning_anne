manning on saturday  march  in on writing font size larger smaller hits 9  comments subscribe to this entry print bookmark looking for a novel writing software that is affordable and easytouse anne has a recommendationfor years ive looked for the system that piece of software plotting program or philosophy that would help me to write faster and better after all the one single thing that boosts your sales is a big back list most of the writing software ive found have been tailored for scriptwriting and they were expensive like hundreds of dollars for the top of the line version i recently became aware of another one thats actually been around for a while writeway wwwwritewayprocom i was a little skeptical after all it wasnt expensive only  for the full pro version so how powerful could it be but there was a demo version with all the functionality of the pro version except for printing and exporting files more on that later so i figured i would try it download and installation of the demo was easy and fast and i had it open in minutes this is where i give you my con on this software it isnt totally intuitive that is i wasnt able to open it and start working immediately im usually fast on the uptake especially since all pccompatible software looks pretty much like your normal microsoft product writeway comes with sample data and a tutorial to guide the new user through all the functions from setting up a new book file to how to export to a regular document if you go through the tutorial you probably wont have any trouble afte familiarizing myself with all the tabs and buttonsand there are lotsi imported my latest workinprogress it was quick and painless i had to do some rearranging on the very handy structure tree that shows up on the left of the display this tree shows you your whole book in scenes chapters and acts moving a scene or chapter from one place to another is not difficult there are lots of great features in writewaypro the best is that your entire wip is in one place from initial ideas to research for a particular book to character descriptions to the actual draft of the book the pro version has a storyboard which takes the information you enter and shows you graphically the best single feature is the word count tracking writeway will tell you how many words youve written during the day and you can project your book tell writeway when you start when you want to be finished and itll tell you how many words you need to do and show you on a daytoday basis how youre doing needless to say i purchased the pro version for the ridiculously reasonable price of  the standard version isnt quite as powerful so you cant import a wip theres no storyboard or research section but at  its a pretty good buy for just writing check out the features before you buy and i highly recommend downloading the demo and trying it out before you decide to buy writewaypro is the very best plotting and writing software ive ever investigated and the only one ive ever actually bought i use it and recommend it highly rate this blog entry  after the droughtbugs whew website finally updated  or perseverance trackbacks trackback url for this blog entry anne

history main navigation home company history opal what is opal where does it come from services products natural opal products gilson created opal synthetics specialty items natural colored gems closeouts contact us company historymore than  years have passed since george t manning left europe for australia his job as an international grain merchant was to develop a more robust trade between his european firm and the vast potential of australias agricultural community as things go mannings assignment was scrapped largely due to the looming threat of war brewing in europe one day while still in sydney planning his next professional move manning was introduced to a friend of a friend in the local grain trade this friend of a friend was a rough opal broker at that moment in a pub in sydney the story of mannings rise to dominance in the opal trade began he was to become worldrenowned as “the opal king” but this unofficial title a sign of the respect with which the mining and dealing communities in australia regarded him didn’t come easily in those early days opal was still a relatively unknown gemstone commodity many false starts had come and gone to introduce opal to european markets almost no trade had been established with the usa distances were so great costs so high and transport times far too long to permit a practical trade in opal also there was the lingering superstition in many european countries that opal might bring bad luck to the wearer this superstition took root from sir walter scott’s depiction of opal’s mysterious radiance in his  novel  anne of geierstein or the maiden of the mist due to the novel’s vast european popularity scott’s description of opal as a mystical object led to the gem’s disfavor from the mid 9th century into the early th century so dispelling the superstition became a hurdle opal had to overcome yet opal continued to grow in popularity with those who disregarded the unfounded belief that scott’s novel had generated in fact it was queen victoria and sarah bernhardt the first renowned trendsetting western famous personalities who chose to ignore the superstition and purchase fine queensland opal for their collections mannings plan was to immigrate to the us but without a means of support he knew this wasn’t possible when he saw that first rough opal parcel he asked many key questions how much was it where was it mined was there a steady supply who marketed it and where how could one judge the rough in relation to the cut output manning purchased this parcel and sold it in sydney for a fair profit a few days later he bought more and sold it quickly to the local sydney cutters his interest aroused he met some old hands in the mining game who’d prospected in white cliffs and andamooka together they planned a trek to the fields an introductory adventure that manning treasured until the day he died his many years of fieldbuying in andamooka coober pedy and lightning ridge never quite equaled that first flush of excitement during those early journeys over land from sydney to the opal fields the outback the rugged miners life the thrill of a new find cleaning and classing the rough cutting and selling it to the market – fueled his decision to devote the rest of his life to promoting australian opal as one of the world’s premier gemstones in 9 manning immigrated to the usa to start the business in new york citys then jewelry district in the maiden lanecanal street area he went door to door showing his stones building interest selling as he could because his stones were “freesized” there was a volume limit to growth of the business unless he could find a way to sell volume he knew he’d be limiting the opportunity to increase sales a paradigmshifting idea blossomed manning recognized that opal had great potential as a manufacturer’s volume item no one had yet seriously considered calibrating opal in high volume supply had always been limited quality had never been assured thus he saw his opportunity manning’s broker relationships with australia’s pogany family and later the collins and keady organizations allowed for a constant stream of rough to be sent wherever manning required he’d already completed the arduous task of categorizing opal establishing color and quality grades calculating yields and selecting the sizes and shapes that would become the opal standard for the industry now the need to feed volume to the market became urgent mannings new york cutting operation couldn’t keep up with the demand for freesize and single stones and definitely not for calibrated sizes so manning began his search for a suitably skilled source to properly slice and cut his opal his first efforts to develop a reliable volumecutting operation took him to idaroberstein idar cutters had already become skilled in cutting and polishing opal but not in calibrating it for volume markets but very soon germany became too costly a cutting environment for high volume output the postwar boom had led to a significant rise in labor costs manning had to find another source of skilled labor if his plan was to succeed once again he traveled around the world in search of highly skilled and affordable labor markets to produce the volume cutting required by the american manufacturing industry’s insatiable demand for product hawaii samoa indonesia fiji the philippines thailand – each had potential but none were suited to meet the requirement for precise high volume calibration cutting of opal after disappointing starts and stops he arrived in hong kong it was that visit that spawned what has become the modern opal cutting industry today manning found a willing audience in mr ngai and mr chan of wan kow gems these two men owned a tiger eye and jade cutting factory they were fascinated by the unique beauty of the opal rough manning brought them he sat at the slicer demonstrating the skill necessary to clean the matrix from the gem material to reveal its optimum color he showed them what variations were common how to avoid cracks and imperfections the dopping and finishing process were much the same as with tiger eye thus the skills of one could be adapted to the other for ten years manning and wan kow dominated hong kongs opal industry transactions were routine and reliable direct rough opal shipments from the field priced fairly with consistent quality made this enterprise possible the businesses prospered the only real competition for fine rough opal came from manning’s japanese counterpart mr yamamoto yamamoto also purchased large quantities of rough opal to satisfy postwar japan’s appreciation for this fine gemstone these two men loomed large on the rough opal horizon for many many years with george t mannings passing in april of 9 so passed the original link to a business adventure that still continues today manning international is the successor company to manning opal corporation and wan kow gems has evolved many times over into the current population of fine cutting houses in hong kong and the prc australias opal mining industry existed long before george mannings first bout of “opal fever” great names in the business far older than the manning name along with newer entries still appear on company logos marks lane bartram costello van brugge keady christianos giles sherman cudlipp king – and many many others remain at the core of the australian opal industry greek italian german and slavic immigrants along with more recent chinese newcomers populate the mining communities of the outback in search of the magical amorphous silica gemstone that is australian opal until george t mannings entry into the opal world no one had succeeded with such vast market penetration and product development as he achieved in his  years at the helm of his opal business so it is with great pride in his memory that manninginternationalcom and its parent manning opal company inc recognizes george t manning’s achievements as our model of excellence in reputation in reliable international relations and in marketing honesty and integrity  see httpenwikipediaorgwikianneofgeierstein  anne of
