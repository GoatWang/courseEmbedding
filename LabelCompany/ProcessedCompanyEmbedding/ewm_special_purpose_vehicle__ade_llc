june   one day prior to gms annual shareholder meeting rick wagoner gms ceo at that time said the brand was being reviewed and had the possibility of either being sold having the production line

ja tengzhong fund spc a private equity investment fund owned by an offshore entity that was recruiting private investors to buy into its acquisition plan the financial markets posed problems for established borrowers and even more for tengzhong a littleknown company from western china at the same time as the potential value of the hummer brand continued to decline given high fuel prices and weak consumer demand the company announced it was willing to consider offers for all or part of the assets american company raser technologies along with several others expressed interest in buying

the criticism of suvs in general but to a higher degree specific criticisms of hummers include size hummers specifically the h and h are significantly bigger than other suvs this can cause problems parking driving and fitting in a garage their large size may also pose a serious threat to smaller vehicles poor fuel economy even compared to other heavy passenger vehicles hummers without the diesel engine options have very poor fuel economy because the h is built to the overlb gvw class its fuel economy is neither published by the us epa nor counted toward corporate average fuel economy for example h in one engine configuration averages an estimated  mpg‑us  l km  mpg‑imp on the highway and  mpg‑us  l km  mpg‑imp in the city it has a curb weight of around  lb  kg safety crash data for hummers is less complete than for other suvs as a class  truck the hummer is exempt from many dot safety regulations the h lacks standard safety features including child safety locks child seat tethers side air bags and stability control large blind spots make parking difficult and possibly dangerous drivers a oneyear study conducted by a firm that provides statistical information to

tweet pinit by catherine thompson published may    am views politicians across the country jockeyed to get a piece of the “jade helm ” action after gov greg abbott r asked the state guard to monitor the planned us military training exercise texans waded into the fever swamp of conspiracy theories surrounding the training exercise in recent weeks and took some of their elected representatives along for the ridebut what’s lost in all that noise is the training exercise itself how service members plan to execute it and what the military aims to accomplish an army release about the training exercise in march described “jade helm ” as a routine multistate operation taking place from july  to sept  the release noted that the training exercise is in a class apart from other operations due to its “size and scope”“the public can expect nothing much different from their daytoday activities since much of exercise will be conducted in remote areas” the release read “the most noticeable effect the exercise may have on the local communities is an increase in vehicle and military air traffic and its associated noise”the release also stated that communities hosting the exercise could expect economic benefits from the army’s fuel and food purchases and hotel lodgingbut in terms of staging plans for the training exercise have apparently changed significantly since that statement was issued in march california colorado and nevada were all initially reported to be hosting parts of the exercise — and were depicted on a map “leaked” by conspiracy theory website all news pipeline that labelled texas as “hostile” territory — but are no longer involved the states currently expected to host the operation are texas arizona new mexico utah mississippi louisiana and florida according to an updated army press release dated april the most detailed information available on the training exercise itself comes not from either of those releases but from a slideshow prepared by us army special operations command local radio station wtaw made available both the audio and visual presentation that army representatives gave to the commissioners court of brazos county texas in february while seeking their approval for the training exercisethe slideshow explained that the exercise would involve army special forces in addition to navy seals air force special operations command marines special operations command and the nd airborne division it also listed  participating areas within texas although officials in victoria and gilead counties have since said the military canceled plans to hold part of the training exercise therethe slideshow also spelled out why the army specifically approached communities in texas about hosting “jade helm ” citing the state’s rural landscape as well as its historic support for america’s troopstom meade an army spokesman and retired green beret explained in the accompanying audio presentation why “jade helm ” is considered an “unconventional warfare” exercise meade said that while us special forces have been conducting unconventional warfare — assisting and supporting insurgency — for over  years troops had adopted a counterinsurgency role over the last  years in the wars in iraq and afghanistan“we’re bringing these guys back and we’re dusting off the skills that they already have — because every green beret learns unconventional warfare when he leaves the qualification course” meade said “a lot of these guys haven’t practiced it in the last few years so we’re bringing those skills back to the forefront for them”the “leaked” version of the slideshow posted by all news pipeline the conspiracy theory website differed somewhat from the one meade presented to the commissioners court of brazos county that version contained a slide that said the training exercise offered “the opportunity to work with civilians to gain their trust and an understanding of the issues” another slide said local residents could expect some individuals to “conduct suspicious activities designed to prepare them for complex environments overseas” or “be wearing civilian attire and driving civilian vehicles”those slides which are not included in the presentation posted by wtaw were widely cited in conspiracy theory blog posts on “jade helm ” while the conspiracy theories themselves lack real evidence there’s something to the concerns about soldiers blending in with the general population for the purposes of the training exercisea realistic military training exercise took a deadly turn in  when a moore county north carolina sheriff’s deputy pulled over what he thought was a suspiciouslooking truck and shot two soldiers killing one and wounding another the soldiers were participating in an exercise similar to “jade helm ” known as “robin sage” and had believed that the sheriff’s deputy was playing a role in the operation toothe army runs “robin sage” which is akin to a final exam for green beret candidates multiple times a year in a staging area off fort bragg that encompasses several counties that  incident led the army to immediately alter the way it conducted that exercise including ordering participants to wear their uniforms and ending the practice of allowing local law enforcement officials to roleplay alongside the soldiersseparately reason magazine’s jesse walker writing in a los angeles times oped pointed to a  exercise in oakland california that posited the “jade helm ” conspiracy theories were an extreme manifestation of the current backlash against police militarization in the usthe exercise known as “operation urban warrior” attracted vocal opposition twentytwo demonstrators were arrested for storming thenmayor jerry brown’s office and demanding a meeting to protest his embrace of the marines’ urban combat simulation one detained protest organizer told the san francisco chronicle that the group was “angry at the impact the marines are having on the community — the noise the intimidation the message it sends”that sounds a lot like the complaints raised at an april  meeting at the bastrop county texas courthouse where over a hundred residents gathered to pepper army lt colonel mark lastoria with questions about “jade helm ” residents’ responses ran the gamut from “would the court be offended if i told the colonel i didn’t believe a single word that he just said” to “i appreciate the explanations you’ve been given because it’s alleviating a lot of our concerns”“you may have issues with the federal government you may have issues with the administration” lastoria told the denizens of bastrop county “so be it but this institution right here has been with you for over  years period”tpm illustration images via ap and shutterstockludvig
