favorable tax treatment compared to a sole owner regardless of legal structure all businesses need a business license and an ein but also need to select a legal stucture choosing from sole propritor partnership llc or corproration more about selecting a structure ✔  thus file a dba if you dont file an llc you are required to file a dba if you are a partneship or a sole owner and you dont form an llc if you form an llc you need an llc certificate if you select the llc structure etc a dba llc or corporation certificate is issued by the state a dba doing business as is the registration of your

you set up an llc or corp you dont need to file a dba more about selecting a structure ✔  so all businesses need to select a legal structure in this case an llc and obtain a business license and a federal llcein while all businesses must obtain a business license the ein is for employers independent contractors llcs partnerships and corporations that are required to obtain a federal ein if you are a sole owner independent contractor or an employer you will need an ein or you can nevertheless obtain it and use it instead of your social sec  ✔  finally your llc may need a early childhood

faqs q should i consider forming an llc a perhaps filing an llc may be a good idea though some start with an s corp on the other hand if you want to issue shares you may want a c corporation if your business name is deas xyztch  incco requires a fictitious business name registration which also requires a fee to be registered registering a fictitious business name does not protect that name nor does it protect the business owner from personal liability related to business actions as setting up a limited liability company llc does our recommendation that since you need to pay a fee to register the business name simply form a limited liability company llc for a similar fee and get both corporate status and protection for the name as well as personal liabilities so for instance if someone slips and falls in your business premises they can sue you personally if you are not a limited liability company llc also consider the prestige that a limited liability company llc affords is a name like johns transmissiona shop better than aemcoo trans llc q where should i incorporate or set up an llc ie what state a we always recommend that you file an llc in the state you conduct

member owner in that llc q do i need to obtain a federal or state llc number before forming a limited liability company llc or getting other licenses a q how do i build credit under my llc business a
