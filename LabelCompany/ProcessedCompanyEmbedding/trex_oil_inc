marketing of oil  gas and obtaining goods services and labor many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available funds available information about prospective properties and our standards established for minimum projected return on investment competition is also presented by alternative fuel sources including ethanol and other fossil fuels because of our use of eor techniques and management’s experience and expertise in the oil  gas industry we believe that we are effective in competing in the market the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to operate co eor techniques drill wells and conduct field operations geologists geophysicists engineers and other professionals in the oil industry can fluctuate significantly often in correlation with oil prices causing periodic shortages there have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled these factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment services and personnel higher oil prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs crews and associated supplies equipment and services we cannot be certain when we will experience these issues and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin cash flow and operating results or restrict our ability to drill those wells and
