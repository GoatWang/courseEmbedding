the new advisory agreement in determining whether to approve the new advisory agreements the board considered the best interests of each fund separately in voting to approve the new advisory agreements the board considered the overall fairness of the new advisory agreements and factors it deemed relevant with respect to each fund including but not limited to i the nature extent and quality of the services to be provided by the adviser ii that the investment personnel who currently manage the funds would continue to manage the funds as employees of the adviser iii that the fees and expenses of the funds after the transaction are    table of contents expected to remain the same iv the projected profitability of the funds to the adviser and its affiliates v whether the

relationship with the funds the board also considered that the transaction might not be consummated if the new advisory agreements were not approved by the board and the shareholders of each fund although not meant to be allinclusive set forth below is a description of the information and certain factors that were considered by the board including the independent trustees in deciding to approve the new advisory agreements in respect of each fund the nature extent and quality of services to be provided by the adviser personnel and operations of the adviser     in considering the nature extent and quality of the services to be provided by the adviser under the new advisory agreements the board considered that the terms of the new advisory agreements are substantially similar to the terms of the current advisory agreements the board considered that the level of service and manner in which each funds assets are managed were expected to remain the same the board considered that for a period of time after closing the adviser expects that the operations of the adviser as they relate to the funds would be the same as those of the adviser currently the board considered that the advisers key personnel who provide services to the funds are expected to provide those same services after the transaction the board also noted that the transaction is not expected to result in any change in the structure or operations of the funds and that the adviser does not currently anticipate any immediate changes to the funds key service providers in evaluating the adviser the board considered the history background reputation and qualification of the adviser and henderson as well as their personnel and hendersons financial condition the board considered that henderson is a global asset management firm that was established in  and that it has a long history of asset management around the world the board also considered the advisers capabilities experience corporate structure and capital resources as well as the advisers longterm business goals with respect to the transaction and the funds based on its consideration and review of the foregoing information the board determined that each fund was likely to benefit from the nature quality and extent of these services as well as the advisers ability to render such services based on their experience personnel operations and resources cost of the services to be provided and profits to be realized by the adviser from the relationship with the funds fallout benefits     the board noted that the unitary fee currently in place for each fund will remain in place and unchanged under the new advisory agreements the board also discussed the anticipated costs and projected profitability of the adviser in

materially as a result of the transaction the board also noted that henderson does not currently provide any investment management services to other exchange traded funds in light of the nature extent and quality of services proposed to be provided by the adviser and the costs expected to be incurred by the adviser in rendering those services the board concluded that the level of fees proposed to be paid to the adviser with respect to the funds were fair and reasonable the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the funds grow and whether fee levels would reflect such economies of scale     the board next discussed potential economies of scale the board discussed the promised continued commitment to expand the distribution of fund shares and the potential for increased distribution capabilities as a result of the transaction which have the potential to result in longterm economies of scale the board also noted that since the trust is newly formed the eventual aggregate amount of assets was uncertain and therefore specific information concerning the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as each fund grows and whether fee levels would reflect such economies of scale if any was difficult to determine the board recognized the uncertainty in launching new investment products and estimating future asset levels other benefits to the adviser     the board considered other potential benefits that may accrue to the adviser as a result of its relationship with the funds which include reputational benefits that may enhance the advisers ability to gain business opportunities from other clients conclusion     no single factor was determinative to the decision of the board based on but not limited to the foregoing and such other
