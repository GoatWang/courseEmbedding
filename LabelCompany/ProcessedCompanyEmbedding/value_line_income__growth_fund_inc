responsible for the fund’s outstanding performance in the first quarter the fund’s strong performance was a reflection of our asset allocation decisions and stock selection as of march   the fund had an  weighting in equities comprised primarily of faster growing largecap companies and  in fixed income and cash the fund outperformed the morningstar  equity allocation funds category by nearly  basis points in the first quarter during the period the fund benefited from investors’ rotation back into more secular growthoriented companies especially in the faster growing sectors such as information technology and health care the fund’s overweight allocation and stock selection in the it and health care sectors were the primary drivers of the fund’s performance among the fund’s equity holdings in the technology sector that significantly added to performance during the quarter were activision blizzard mobileye facebook and broadcom as these companies increased    and  respectively

provider of software and design solutions used in camerabased advanced driver assistance systems agreed to be acquired by intel for  billion resulting in mobileye’s stock price rising  in the first quarter of  how might the fund’s equity and fixed income allocations change over the next year we believe the fund’s flexible allocation provides a strategic advantage for investors particularly in a rising interest rate environment while the fund continues to favor stocks over fixed income exemplified by a current equity allocation of  we remain nimble and responsive to market conditions for example we could adjust the allocation mix during market volatility or following a sharp rise in equity prices however in an environment of rising rates we believe many balanced fund investors will
