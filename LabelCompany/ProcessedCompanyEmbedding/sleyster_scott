scott sleyster  prudential international  zoominfocom   testimony of scott sleyster committee on education and the workforce hearings testimony of scott sleyster president prudential retirement services and guaranteed products february   good afternoon chairman johnson ranking member andrews and members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to appear this afternoon to testify about the need for investment advice for participants in defined contribution retirement plans and the safety and soundness associated with the provisions contained in the pension security act  an issue that could impact millions of retirement plan participants i am scott sleyster president of prudential retirement services and guaranteed products a business of prudential financial prudential has over  years of experience serving the retirement needs of public private and nonprofit organizations we manage or administer more than  billion of retirement assets and provide services to  million defined contribution participants and  defined benefit annuitants participants urgently need investment advice let me begin mr chairman by stating that as you and chairman boehner recognized in your sponsorship and reintroduction of the pension security act federal pension law needs to be amended and modernized to encourage employers to provide workers with access to professional investment advice when erisa was passed in  defined benefit plans were the primary platform upon which retirement plans were being delivered and thus the focus of legislation was based heavily on the defined benefit system today defined contribution plans dominate the retirement landscape with over  million workers relying on defined contribution plans for all or part of their nonsocial security retirement income as you know defined contribution plans shift all the investment risk to workers in defined benefit plans the employer retains the investment risk and typically hires actuarial firms to establish funding requirements and test plan adequacy and hires investment professionals to design appropriate asset allocation strategies and to make investment decisions in defined contribution plans participants are typically making these decisions on their own and clearly these workers want and need access to advice this is evidenced in a survey of participants that prudential recently conducted the survey found that the majority of workers are still a long way from a secure retirement and that because of poor goalsetting and a lack of savings more than ever before they need guidance and advice among the surveys notable findings are  of american workers feel they are not saving as much as they should for their retirement among workers who are not enrolled in any employersponsored retirement plans this figure rises to  few workers have established an informed retirement savings goal only  of all respondents have set any type of a goal and barely  of those between  and  have a formal plan in a very disappointing finding upon followup questioning we learned that  of those who indicated that they had established a goal indicated they did so by guessing this is consistent with findings in the  retirement confidence survey indicating that only  of workers surveyed have calculated how much money they will need to have saved by the time they retire many workers are eligible for employersponsored retirement plans but do not participate based on their demographic profile these individuals might need the most help out of these nonparticipants  do not have a college degree  have less than  in annual income of these  are married with children defined contribution participants indicate that they would like to get financial advice through their plan to help them better manage their investment decisions a strong majority  of participants responded that if they had access to a professional investment advisor they would increase their savings level and  said they would reallocate their portfolio based on this advice personalized advice can also help nonparticipants gain the confidence they need to join employersponsored plans in fact  of nonparticipants indicated that personalized planning would influence their decision to participate in the plan fund providers are best positioned to offer advice to the plan participants in plans they administer mr chairman we at prudential are committed to finding effective and efficient ways to provide investment advice to defined contribution plan participants while some have expressed concern that advice from fund providers has the potential to be biased there are several reasons why fund providers are actually best positioned to offer advice to the plans they administer furthermore the legislation includes crucial protections that ensure that participants are protected from conflicts of interest the reasons we are best suited to provide advice and participants would be protected are here are the reasons efficient and effective delivery plan recordkeepers who currently offer investment funds already have access to and knowledge of plan investment options and rules as well as payroll and contribution records for each participant delivery of investment advice could be done at a fairly low cost since it is only an extension of the services already provided to the plan erisa fiduciary status advisors would be required to acknowledge their status as fiduciaries and be subject to erisas fiduciary responsibility rules and prudence standard erisa requires fiduciaries to act in the best interest of participants and to be liable for any breach of their fiduciary duty simply put under these rules it would be illegal for advisors to make specific investment recommendations for the sole purpose of increasing their or their firms compensation marketplace standards the defined contribution market is intensely competitive and will would create significant pressure for advisors to provide the best possible advice inevitably this will lead to benchmarking of performance which will further safeguard participants interests plan fiduciaries also employerswill have an extensive universe of investment advisors to choose from and ample opportunities and choices to replace any advisors not performing at the highest level monitoring by plan fiduciary plan sponsors would continue to select the range of investment choices available to participants in their defined contribution plans erisas fiduciary rules will would continue to apply to the employer who selects the advisor thus the employer would be required to act prudently and solely in the interest of participants in selecting and periodically monitoring the advisor to assure that advice was being provided in the best interest of participants however the bill does encourage employers to offer advice by making it clear that if they fulfill these duties they will not be liable for the specific advice given by the advisor fee and limitation disclosure investment advisors would be required to disclose in plain writing to the employer and to participants fees the nature of the advisors affiliation if any with the available investment options and any limitations on the scope of the advice they provide participant control participants would remain in control of their investment decisions the bill requires that all investment decisions be made by the participant not the advisor the advisor may not make discretionary would not have discretion to make investment decisions on behalf of participants credentialed advisors advisors would be required to be appropriately credentialed and would be subject to regulations under other federal or state securities banking or insurance laws conclusion mr chairman if the goal of the legislative efforts goal is to help as many qualified plan participants as possible gain access to high quality professional investment advice the overall solution must include the ability for fund providers to offer advice fund providers serving as recordkeepers are in the best position to provide investment advice in a low cost and effective manner if we do not find a more effective way to allow defined contribution plan participants to access professional investment advice we will not have done enough to help americans make
