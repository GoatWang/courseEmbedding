our management is characterized by a handson approach what does this mean it means your portfolio will be managed to gain the most from the current investment environment this work is constant and continuous so that your money will grow we invest in pillar companies  these companies have the best growth prospects in the stock market and are marked as being exciting and innovative  these companies are widely recognized and relevant  investing in these companies can make a big difference in your portfolio our timetested comprehensive spectrum of research and management means you will invest in many stocks in order to find the pillars for your investment portfolio all  investments chosen are designed so that you will make a profit but many of these stocks need to be sold because the companies don’t continue to meet stringent tests for holding them in a portfolio throughout the process of filtering  your portfolio you should expect monthly cumulative trading profits from the stocks that are sold the onetwo combination of long term gains and monthly short term profits will “make your assets thrive” and give you an investment edge trading profits and long term gains are the building blocks  to financial independence and “…making assets thrive”   past performance is no guarantee of future results investment management involves the possibility of losses significant general

portfolio a high performing portfolio has a dual mandate to generate growth and minimize setbacks at the same time a high performing portfolio strikes a balance that reflects the natural condition of the overall economy and has suitable diversification so that at least some investments within the portfolio will flourish given whatever circumstances occur to create a high performing portfolio the construction process means a “pinch of this and a pinch of that” culminating in an account that provides superior investment performance sometimes this process can take a while and test our patience ultimately these carefully chosen components will reflect the good things happening in the investment ecosystem and the portfolio will deliver long term growth a high performing portfolio needs to own the most relevant companies in industry that shape the business landscape these companies are recognizable names and their products and services are well known amazon facebook federal express honeywell john deere and union pacific are examples of holdings that we might use for client portfolios these companies are impossible for investors to ignore a high performing portfolio needs stocks that hold the best relative strength these are companies that have the best recent relative price performance compared to all other stocks they may not be immediately recognized as household names we currently own acuity brands in this category up  since the february  low for the market ulta salon and equinix are also great examples of relative strength in the current market a high performing portfolio has investments that are complementary to the macroeconomy these investments benefit from prevailing economic themes for example the current economy is marked by low interest rates muted economic growth and central banks that are printing money under these economic conditions dividend paying stocks utilities and gold are more desirable to investors and will work well a high performing portfolio needs diversification this means investing in areas which are out of favor or neglected by the investment mainstream we invest in companies that are substantially down from historic levels as potential turnaround candidates these investments give clients diversification because stocks that are oversold are more resilient withstanding market downturns more readily we also inject diversification by investing in foreign markets because these markets can perform differently than the us markets finally a high performing portfolio must generate profits our client investments need to be fruitful so this means selling stocks for gains stocks typically top out and decline at some point so investment gains need to be harvested the construction of a high performing portfolio will lead to good long term growth for our client assets lower interest rates hikes stocks the markets have been getting good traction since june  and the sp  has broken out to new all time highs in recent days despite this the earnings reports from the sp  companies are estimated to decline  in the quarter ending june  generally sales and earnings are actually falling year over year furthermore our economy is barely growing nevertheless stocks are doggedly moving higher due to lower interest rates and highly accommodating central banks around the world since stock valuation models are determined by interest rates when interest rates decline stock valuations rise so even if earnings decline which is happening now prices can rise due to lower long term interest rates we are relieved at the recent market rally but we realize these levels are only fractionally above the late  levels in addition many broader market measures like the russell  and the new york stock exchange index rest below their  highs these lagging indices also might point to a catch up phase where the market rally broadens to include smaller companies if recent gains hold and the market doesn’t slip back to its old range we could really enjoy some momentum to the upside brexit amidst the acrimony over this politically charged event brexit has not carried an enduring consequence to the us stock market peregrine portfolios client portfolios are on a path for a good year our equity composite gained  for  through june  our balanced composite is up  the sp  was up  for the first half of  further gains have happened in july this strength can feed on itself as the market breaks out of its range many companies present exciting opportunities along with acuity brands mentioned above bright prospects exist in facebook select steel companies gold mining stocks energy pipelines foreign bonds mortgages real estate companies and housing companies it is important that high performing portfolios earn compensation from interest and dividends many stocks offer dividends far above the yield on treasury bonds and cds so it is natural for us to invest in these companies for clients in addition many etfs offer dividend yields which can give clients good returns with low risk dan botti portfolio manager  click to download the market overview pdf past performance is no guarantee of future results
