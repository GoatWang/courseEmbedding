reviews chungbridges katherine mdciarao ratedi found this dr on the avmed physician directory i went in for my first visit yesterday and it was a very nice surpriselocation the office is located in a large intersection the regions bank building on th and biscayne so its impossible to miss it parking is free and offices are tidy staff the reason why i chose this dr to begin with was the service i got over the phone i went through a list of places and most places had really unprofessional and rude receptionists at which case i hung up and tried a different number until bingo i hit this office the receptionist is very polite and soft spoken she is very professional and just a pleasure to speak to very nice and friendly first plusi did wait a little longer than usual but the front desk young lady told me that my insurance was having technical difficulties and she couldnt get in touch with them they had a nice big flat screen tv in the reception which made my wait barely noticeabledr she is extremely nice and polite so genuinely concerned and listened to all my crazy rants and medical history ups and downs she was very receptive to all my comments and offered great advice and even helped me with recommendations on other specialists i should see she even had the front desk girl make copies with specialist information and wrote referrals so i wouldnt have any problems with my insurance covering my services she also took down the names of all my prescription meds and found cheaper alternatives and then sent them directly to my pharmacy so i wouldnt even have to bother dropping them off wow this place is really amazing and understands people and how to take care of them and their needs i would most definitely recommend this place christopher hodgkins mdalex d ratedmy experience with dr hodgkins  his staff are excellent i was supposed to do a  at the end of the month of sept in augusta georgia and  week prior my race broke my ankle while training on my cycling bike on  had surgery on  i was devastated and i couldnt believe it that this was happening to me so i left it in god hand since i did already sign up for a full ironman  in nov and the race is for nov  i was scare to death that was going to able to compete on this race i did ask the dr if i was able to run again and he told me i would be back to normal within the six month is only been  month and one week and i been swimming cycling and running on the treadmill  to  miles twice a week and today he gave me the news that i wanted to hear that i could run in the pavement i thank god everyday how lucky i am to have this dr come thru my path and perform surgery and his staff for taking care of mefrom the bottom of my heart thank you dr hodgkins and your staff alex dpazmino byron mdanto g ratedi was very nervous about a facelift because of so many horror stories ive heard  seen but my daughter n law had a tummy tuck with dr pazmino so when i saw how great he was with her i knew i had found my surgeon  his hands are blessed  im a few days out  the staff has really gone above  beyond for me  i feel so comfortable  when i first got there i met cathy who really made the financial part of this surgery possible  then  i met jesenia who i had spoken to on the phone before  really made me feel confident about what i was about to do going over some details about the procedure finally i had my visit before my surgery i met malena who went over what to expect  how i can best get ready for the surgery  i have truly had a smooth experience  im  days out and im barely bruised  feel great but if i feel  look great now  then i can only imagine in a few weeks  so excited to get some of my youth back christopher hodgkins mdoscar a rateddr hodgkins is a true professional and an amazing surgeon i fractured my ankle and when i visited dr hodgkins he explained everything in great detail and was there to answer every question i had i never felt rushed his bedside manners were great i knew that he would be the doctor to operate me the follow up post surgery was awesome they followed up to see if i felt good and if i had any questions for the doctor  weeks post surgery i feel great the office appointments are very punctual if your appointment is at pm you are in at pm they never make you wait more than  min the operation was a total success people see me walking now and cant believe i had surgery just a few weeks ago i would definitely recommend dr hodgkins to anyone who needs ankle surgerycarlos e wiegering mdursula a ratedme hace feliz

for a recommendation he is an amazing doctor who we have the upmost respect for also his office staff especially jen are awesome she is efficient and on top of things we have never had a bad experience with this officeojea juan carlosgregg m ratedwas treated like crap i dont know if it was because he had a bad day at his job at the hospital or what but ive never been treated so rudely by a doctor sit in his office for five hours waiting for him to show up i was forced to bend and move which was very painful especially after sitting in that hard chair for five hours just to be talked to and treated like crap he didnt even look at my records only went by what his nurses put in the file the urine test was completely wrong i honestly think he was just having a bad day surely he doesnt treat people he doesnt know like that christopher hodgkins mde k ratedi am  years old and dr hodgkins is probably the best dr i have ever been to he is an excellent surgeon and excels at his profession  i broke my ankle and had to have  screws  large plate  buttons and a trapeze to hold it all together i have basically had no pain since  days postop his bedside manner is incredible and he really wants his patients to be happy and he and his staff work very hard to achieve that i have never written a review for a medical professional but he is so fabulous that he and his staff deserve my highest complimentschristopher hodgkins mdoliver r ratedamazing experience from drhodgkins for my first experience in the er at  i had contracted a case of mrsa in my right knee drhodgekins

while the doctor and his team took care of me even though it was a painful the experience was pleasant and got taken care of because of them i am super grateful and happy i ended up in their caredid

in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a
