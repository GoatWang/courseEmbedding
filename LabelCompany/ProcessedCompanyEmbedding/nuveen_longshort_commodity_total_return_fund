strategic indexbased approach to commodity investing exposure to  commodities that can individually be long or flat if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash the ability to make position changes intramonth based on trends monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels a “smart” contract roll approach  smart contract roll approach – a futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract why invest in the fund the longflat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable longonly commodity indices has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intramonth risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially more adaptive to whipsawing market conditions fund details component sectors and current positioning metals position longflat copper flat gold long silver long agriculture position

vary based on risk levels target index the auspice broad commodity er index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends the index uses a

  the commodity markets contended with rising geopolitical risks as violence increased with attacks by the militant groups isis islamic state of iraq and syria in iraq and boko haram in nigeria moderating global weather conditions and wellreceived efforts by the chinese government to stimulate its economy through fiscal policy and market reforms the broad commodity market traded flat in the quarter ended june   returning  as measured by the dow jones ubs commodity index djubsci effective july   the name of the index changed to the bloomberg commodity index the index the morningstarr longshort commodity indexsm and the funds benchmark was up  for the quarter led by livestock and energy metals and agriculture were the weakestperforming groups in the index posting losses for the quarter livestock advanced  in the index and is the smallest group comprising  of the index at the end of the quarter supply concerns for live cattle led to strong price appreciation in the broad market during the quarter the bad winter weather hampered breeding weight gain and slaughter rates lean hogs prices in contrast were volatile a highly contagious pig virus continued to spread in the us canada and asia fueling supply worries the indexs energy group rose  during the quarter energy commodities represented  of the index at the end of the quarter and were its most significant commodity group by weight in the broader market all energy commodities gained during the quarter led by gains in unleaded gas increasing violence in the middle east and africa raised the risk of future supply disruptions boosting crude oil prices table of contents the metals group posted the weakest performance falling  in the index during the quarter the index includes three metals gold silver and copper which made up a combined  of the overall index at the end of the quarter in the broader market gold and silver prices ended the quarter higher following a rally late in june prompted by inflation worries while copper rebounded from its weakness in the first quarter on chinas efforts to strengthen its economy the indexs agriculture group lost  during the quarter all of the agriculture commodities in the group ended the quarter down in the broad market reports of accelerated plantings abundant supply and favorable weather weighed on prices for corn wheat and soybeans as did concerns about weakening chinese demand for a corn ethanol byproduct and soybeans agricultural commodities made up  of the index at the end of the quarter the quarter ended june    fund commodity portfolio commentary the funds commodity portfolio returned  for the threemonth period before considering the expenses of the fund or the performance of the collateral portfolio the fund outperformed the djubsci which returned  but underperformed the index which returned  the funds total return on net asset value for the quarter which includes the effect of the funds expenses and the performance of the collateral portfolio and assumes the reinvestment of the funds distribution was  the fund may write  that is sell  put and call options on up to  of the value of each of the funds commodity futures contracts during the quarter gresham generally wrote options on approximately  of each commodity futures contract seeking to limit return volatility and to provide cash flow to support the funds distributions the fund receives cash premiums in return for writing options if the fund holds a long position in a specific commodity it will sell covered calls on those contracts if a short position is held it will sell covered puts on contracts in that commodity typically the options sold are at or in the money and the fund receives cash for the related premiums though the majority of the funds option positions expire in the money which can limit the funds full participation in gains related to that commodity position they are an important tool for reducing the funds return volatility for the quarter the fund had lower volatility than the index as measured by standard deviation of nav return the fund has the flexibility to sell both puts and calls on a single commodity should such commodity flip positions ie go from a long position to a short position during the life of a particular option in this case the fund can collect additional premiums during the quarter the fund was able to sell calls on silver and both puts and calls on sugar corn wheat cotton and gold which contributed positively to fund performance a key driver of the indexs long and short positions is the upward or downward momentum in the prices of its constituents relative to the moving averages of commodity prices the funds commodity portfolio long and shortflat positions share the same drivers as the index but are established more actively and with greater frequency intramonth versus the indexs once per month methodology this dependence on momentum puts the index and the funds commodity portfolio at risk to price patterns that seem to demonstrate upward momentum causing a shift from shortflat to long but then shift to an equally compelling semblance of downward momentum causing a shift from long to shortflat this phenomenon is customarily described as a whipsaw and the funds greater potential for trading activity exposes it to greater whipsaw risk than the more passive index in certain periods in terms of commodity groups during the quarter the fund experienced absolute gains in agriculture and absolute losses in energy metals and livestock relative to the index the portfolio outperformed in agriculture but underperformed in energy metals and livestock the funds agriculture position fell  during the quarter compared to a  drop in the indexs corn contributed positively as the fund gained from favorable longshort positioning versus the index during the mayjune price decline in addition the fund benefited from collecting additional premiums from selling both put and call options on corn wheat and sugar however sugar prices were volatile during the quarter which led to flipping activity that detracted from relative performance table of contents the funds energy position up  for the quarter underperformed the indexs up  primarily because of the choppy markets in heatinggas oil which created excess flipping activity throughout the quarter the funds wtibrent exposure also contributed towards underperformance due to options overlay in the metals group the funds  decline for the quarter underperformed the indexs  loss the funds gold position suffered due to disadvantageous positioning throughout the quarter relative to the index silver and copper positions however added slightly to relative performance the funds lean hogs position drove the funds underperformance in livestock during the quarter where the fund lagged the index on an absolute basis by  and underperformed by  on a weighted basis the fund has been long lean hogs since the second quarter of  a choppy trading environment which resulted in mixed prices during the quarter detracted from the funds relative returns the quarter ended june    net assets of the fund and commodity market and portfolio commentary the funds net assets decreased from  million at march   to  million at june   a decrease of  million the decrease in the funds net assets was due to  million in net realized losses and  million in net unrealized appreciation on the funds portfolio during the quarter a net investment loss of  million  million of distributions to shareholders and  million of share repurchases commodity markets continued to struggle in the second quarter of  and were heavily influenced by supply and demand fundamentals of individual markets the broad commodity market fell consecutively in april may and june as most commodities posted declines as measured by the djubsci which fell  for the second quarter of  the manager believes the djubsci is representative of the overall commodities market this was a more favorable environment for strategies with the ability to short commodities the index the morningstarr longshort commodity indexsm and the funds benchmark experienced a slightly positive result of  for the quarter with three of its four commodities groups agriculture energy and livestock experiencing losses for the quarter while metals posted a strong gain just offsetting those losses energy commodities represented  of the index at the end of the period and are its most significant commodity group by weight energy commodities within the longonly djubsci fell  in the quarter as weakening global demand put downward pressure on prices the index suffered a smaller loss of approximately  as the ability to hold flat positions helped limit losses agricultural commodities made up  of the index at the end of the period most agricultural commodities declined in the quarter as the djubsci group lost  due to expectations of generous supplies for many markets including coffee corn and wheat notably soybeans and soybean meal gained over the quarter the indexs agriculture positions fell approximately  in the quarter outperforming the djubsci metals of which there are three in the index gold silver and copper made up a combined  of the index at the end of the quarter the quarter saw all three commodities fall significantly as measured by the djubsci with silver gold and copper falling   and  respectively in the quarter slowing gdp growth in china pointing to lower demand in global manufacturing and domestic construction contributed to some of the largest quarterly declines in the metals arena in many years the index benefitted from these declines as it held short positions and gained approximately  in this group offsetting the losses experienced in the other three groups livestock the smallest group in the index at the end of the period at  gained in longonly terms per the djubsci by approximately  seasonal strength in us demand for summer grilling as well as april and may reports of a virus affecting piglets that could impair breeding of the us herd later in  provided strength in lean hogs the index experienced a small loss of approximately  in this environment table of contents in this mostly negative market environment for commodity prices the funds longshort commodity and options portfolio benefited from the flexibility to hold both long and short positions along with the retention of option premium the funds commodity portfolio outperformed its benchmark index and posted a positive  gain during the second quarter of  before considering the expenses of the fund or the performance of the collateral portfolio with moderately less volatility well outpacing the broad market as measured by the djubsci which lost  for the quarter the funds total return on net asset value for the quarter which includes the effect of the funds expenses and the performance of the collateral portfolio and assumes the reinvestment of the funds distribution was a loss of  relative to the index the primary driver of the funds commodity portfolio outperformance came from agriculture positions followed by relative outperformance in livestock underperformance in metals and energy did not outweigh the benefits in agriculture as many commodities began to display price momentum either positive or negative the negative effects of whipsaw abated which contributed to the positive relative performance see more on whipsaw later in this discussion in agriculture commodities the index held short positions in most of its contracts for much of the period the funds commodity portfolio positions in agriculture rose approximately  versus the indexs loss of approximately  the funds portfolio when compared to the index benefited from switches from short to long or viceversa ahead of the index in corn soybeans and soybean meal which allowed the fund to generate positive returns in this group and drove overall results position switching during the quarter also generated additional option premium in those commodities for the fund as it collected both call and put premiums in line with its options strategy the fund gained approximately  in livestock outperforming the index by approximately  in part due to a switch to a long position in lean hogs in late may in advance of the index which remained short the switch of position in lean hogs also generated additional option premium for the fund gains in livestock while positive to performance had a modest overall impact given the relatively small weight of the group in both the funds portfolio  and in the index  as measured at the end of the period as noted above the indexs metals group returned approximately  for the quarter driven by short positions in all three silver gold and copper metals markets as each fell during the entire quarter the funds commodities portfolio also held short positions for the quarter and returned approximately  on its metals positions underperformance versus the index was a result of switching between long and short positions during the quarter and of options written being exercised which meant some of the upside of holding short metals positions was offset by the funds put options being exercised energy holdings despite their relatively large weight in both the funds portfolio  and within the index  both measured at the end of the period had little impact on relative performance the funds energy positions lost approximately  vs the indexs nearly  loss the funds slight underweight positions and retention of options premium helped mitigate the impact of the absolute underperformance resulting in only a small impact on relative results the fund employs a strategy of writing covered options on commodity futures positions in the portfolio with the goals of limiting the volatility of the funds returns and providing cash flow for the funds distributions gresham utilizes a strategy in which exchangetraded commodity put andor call options are sold on up to  of the value of each of its commodity futures contracts that are deemed to have sufficient trading volume and liquidity during the quarter the fund sold options on approximately  of the value of each commodity position if the fund holds a long position in a specific commodity it will sell covered calls on those contracts if a short position is held it will sell covered puts on contracts in that commodity typically the options sold are at or in the money which results in the collecting of premiums though the majority of the funds option positions expire in the money which can limit the returns of the portfolio they are an important tool for reducing the funds volatility for the quarter the fund had lower volatility than

long position to a short position during the life of a particular option in such a case the fund can collect additional premiums during the quarter the fund was able to sell both puts and calls on several commodities including corn soybean meal soybeans and lean hogs which benefitted the fund it is important to remember that a key driver of the indexs long and short positions is the upward or

report released after the close of the quarter significantly exceeded expectations and alleviated concerns that may was the start of a deceleration trend the brexit vote introduced a host of economic and political uncertainties central bank assurances helped soothe global markets with many assets recovering most if not all of their postbrexit trading losses by the end of the quarter looking at longerterm rates treasury yields fell to new lows in the brexit aftershock as risk aversion sent investors rushing into safehaven assets such as government bonds and precious metals furthermore with japan adopting negative interest rates in early  and low to negative rates across europe commodities and other nonyielding assets have benefited from investors seeking preservation of value although the el ni�o weather pattern officially ended in may several grain and soft commodities saw price increases during the quarter driven by expectations for smaller harvests due to lower rainfalls in southeast asia and india dry weather in brazil and flooding in argentina commodity producers and investors also continued to monitor conditions for a potential la ni�a phenomenon which could begin in the coming months and potentially disrupt growing seasons and transport the energy and industrial metals complexes also saw tightening supply conditions evidence that production cuts have started to balance some of the moreoversupplied markets triggered rallies across crude oil natural gas and zinc the energy sector was further boosted by a number of supply disruptions around the world including forest fires in canada pipeline attacks in nigeria and worker strikes in france and kuwait however the supply tightening trend could slow if the recent price rally encourages producers to reintroduce capacity table of contents the longonly bcom rose  in the second quarter while the funds benchmark index the morningstarr longshort commodity indexsm the index was down  for the quarter within the index the metals and livestock groups delivered gains while the agriculture group declined modestly and the energy group was flat the quarter ended june    overall commodity market commentary the bcom gained  for the quarter while the index fell  within the index the metals and livestock groups posted modest gains while agriculture declined and energy was flat the largest group by weight energy commodities represented  of the index at the end of the quarter in the broad market all energy commodities had positive returns for the quarter unleaded gas delivered the strongest price performance in the group rallying on refinery outages seasonal demand for driving and news that the environmental protection agency was proposing to ease ethanol blend regulations crude oil also performed well in the broad market as both brent and west texas intermediate wti prices rallied off their march lows on declining us rig counts and lower us production estimates from the energy information administration the index maintained flat positions across all energy commodities for the period agricultural commodities made up  of the index at the end of the quarter in the broad market the prices of all agriculture commodities except coffee appreciated during the quarter heavy rainfall across key growing regions in the us propelled grain prices as fields flooded resulting in potentially reduced plantings additionally a june th us department of agriculture usda crop report revealed potentially tighterthanexpected supplies of corn and soybeans dry conditions across a number of wheatexporting countries including canada russia ukraine france and australia further supported price appreciation for wheat as did russias implementation of an export tax to stem high bread prices and inflation cocoa prices were buoyed by a number of supplyrelated concerns including concerns that ghana may not have enough crops to fulfill its  contracts and the potential for an el ni�o weather pattern to disrupt cocoa crops in ecuador indonesia and west africa cotton prices rallied late in the quarter as heavy rains delayed plantings in several us states including texas a top producer of highquality fiber the indexs agriculture group declined  for the quarter the metals group at  of the index at the end of the quarter includes gold silver and copper us dollar movements reduced demand and anticipation of rising us interest rates weighed on gold and silver prices in the broad market copper also suffered losses in the broad market as worries about chinas slowing economy continued to dampen prices the group gained  in the index for the quarter the livestock group at  of the index at the end of the quarter is the smallest group both live cattle and lean hogs contracts declined in the broad market over the quarter cattle prices were choppy during the quarter amid cattle herd rebuilding after last year and rain and flooding across the us midwest creating logistical problems for cattle producers higher supply levels and a slowdown in export demand drove lean hogs prices slightly down for the quarter concerns about the avian flu epidemic also pressured cattle and lean hogs prices us poultry export restrictions enacted because of the avian flu led to an increase in domestic chicken and turkey supplies creating price competition for beef and pork heading into the summer months when demand is usually higher the indexs livestock group was up  for the quarter the quarter ended june    fund commodity portfolio commentary the funds commodity portfolio declined  for the quarter before considering the expenses of the fund or the performance of its collateral portfolio the fund underperformed both the bcom which rose  and the index which fell  the funds total return on net asset value for the quarter which includes the effect of the funds expenses and the performance of the collateral portfolio and assumes the reinvestment of the funds distribution was  the fund may write  that is sell  put and call options on up to  of the value of each of the funds commodity futures contracts during the period gresham generally wrote options on approximately  of each table of contents commodity futures contract seeking to limit return volatility and to provide cash flow to support the funds distributions the fund receives cash premiums in return for writing options if the fund holds a long position in a specific commodity it will sell covered calls on those contracts if a short position is held it will sell covered puts on contracts in that commodity typically the options sold are at or in the money and the fund receives cash for the related premiums though the majority of the funds option positions expire in the money which can limit the funds full participation in gains related to that commodity position they are an important tool for reducing the funds return volatility for the period the fund had higher volatility than the index as measured by standard deviation of nav return the volatility in the commodity markets in particular for energy commodities caused excess trading in the fund and exposed it to whipsaw as explained below this resulted in higher volatility for the funds commodity portfolio relative to the index which remained flat for most energy commodities during the period the fund has the flexibility to sell both puts and calls on a single commodity should such commodity flip positions ie go from a long position to a short position during the life of a particular option in this case the fund can collect additional premiums during the period the fund did so for soybeans soybean meal silver and lean hogs which contributed positively to performance it is important to remember that a key driver of the indexs long and short positions is the upward or downward momentum in the prices of its constituents relative to the moving averages of commodity prices the funds commodity portfolio long and shortflat positions share the same drivers as the index but are established more actively and with greater frequency intramonth versus the indexs once per month methodology this dependence on momentum puts the index and the funds commodity portfolio at risk to price patterns that seem to demonstrate upward momentum causing a shift from shortflat to long but then shift to an equally compelling semblance of downward momentum causing a shift from long to shortflat this phenomenon is customarily described as a whipsaw and the funds greater potential for trading activity exposes it to greater whipsaw risk than the more passive index in certain periods on an absolute performance basis the fund outperformed the index in the agriculture group but lagged in the energy metals and livestock groups during the quarter the bulk of the funds relative underperformance was in the energy group the fund entered the second quarter with flat positions across all energy commodities and began trading in the petroleum products intraquarter but maintained a flat position in natural gas for the entire quarter in may for the first time since the summer of  the fund traded brent crude contracts although energy commodities rallied during the quarter pricing was volatile as fundamental tailwinds clashed with macroeconomic headwinds the volatility caused the fund to experience losses on its energy positions by contrast the index flipped from a flat to a long position in brent crude in late june significantly reducing its exposure to the crude markets price volatility when compared to the fund in the metals group the funds silver position was the main relative laggard silver prices rallied strongly during the quarter on expectations of decreasing mine output and increasing industrial and jewelry demand as well as its appeal as a risk hedge and store of value the fund began the quarter with a short position which was detrimental as prices rose but flipped to long in april whereas the index held a long position for the entire quarter however the fund sold additional call options on silver during the position change and collected extra premiums that were beneficial to overall performance and helped offset some of the underperformance against the index the funds livestock position trailed the indexs position during the quarter the fund continued to hold a short position in live cattle which gained as prices were pressured lower due to rising supply levels and sluggish demand conversely lean hogs futures rallied on expectations for increased demand in china but pricing was volatile intraquarter this choppy trading environment caused the fund to suffer whipsaw effect in its lean hogs position which dampened performance whereas the index experienced lessfrequent position changes the fund sold additional options during the position flips and collected premiums which offset some of the underperformance against the index table of contents the fund strongly outperformed the index in the agriculture group during the quarter soybean meal posted the most outsized relative gains as the fund benefited from more favorable timing in its position flip to long capturing more of the upside in soybean meals price rally the fund also collected additional premiums when it sold call options on soybean meal when it switched to a long position corn was another standout performer for the fund relative to the index although both the fund and index posted losses in corn for the quarter overall the funds more advantageous timing on two different intraquarter trades helped the fund lose less value corn prices rallied for most of the quarter as dry weather in brazil weighed on crop yield expectations and the fund established a long position a month earlier than the index however a bearish crop report in june signaling more abundant supplies than expected caused prices to tumble the fund exited the position mitigating its downside exposure while the index remained long at quarterend the quarter ended june    fund commodity portfolio commentary the funds commodity portfolio was down  for the threemonth period before considering the expenses of the fund or the

where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels a “smart” contract roll approach  smart contract roll approach – a futures contract

to make individual commodity position changes intramonth risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high low or noncorrelation to stocks and bonds disciplined quantitative rulesbased approach to commodity investing why commodities not just commodities – longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities this limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s longterm performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise the direxion indexed commodity strategy fund seeks to match the performance of the auspice broad commodity er index abceri which provides exposure to  commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat in cash based upon price trends this longflat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise and mitigate risk by going flat to cash when prices fall why consider longflat commodities most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise however these longonly commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic individual commodity subsectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments significant drawdowns can be damaging to the longterm performance of a portfolio within the inherently volatile commodity markets a longflat approach is potentially more adaptive to whipsawing market conditions fund details component
