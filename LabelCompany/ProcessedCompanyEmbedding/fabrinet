under the radar and undervalued  fabrinet nysefn  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»fabrinet under the radar and undervaluedmay   about fabrinet fn kumquat research momentum eventdriven longshort equity valuesummaryfabrinet has quietly provided a  return over the past  monthsrevenue and earnings continue to grow at a robust pace as evidenced by the companys most recent earnings reportthe stock is far from fairly valued expect substantial upside introduction fabrinet fabrinet nysefn is one of those companies that has quietly begun a meteoric rise with little attention from investors the stock closed at  on tuesday after an impressive q report on volume of  million shares the stocks average daily volume is just  shares yet this fairly unknown company has returned  over the past  months and does not look poised to cool off anytime soon at current levels this stock is a screaming buy and ill prove it in this article fn data by ycharts i normally dislike buying any stock after it reaches alltime highs but after doing a bit of digging i have come to the conclusion that fns run has more open space ahead of it company overview from fabrinets most recent earnings report fabrinet is a leading provider of advanced optical packaging and precision optical electromechanical and electronic manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers of complex products such as optical communication components modules and subsystems industrial lasers and sensors fabrinet offers a broad range of advanced optical and electromechanical capabilities across the entire manufacturing process including process design and engineering supply chain management manufacturing advanced packaging integration final assembly and test fabrinet focuses on production of high complexity products in any mix and any volume fabrinet maintains engineering and manufacturing resources and facilities in thailand the peoples republic of china and the united states of america as you can tell fabrinet makes a ton of stuff the language it uses to describe its products is somewhat vague so i found a slide in the companys q  investor presentation that outlines fabrinets offerings with more specificity the three main markets the company services are sensors optical components and lasers and the slide above gives an idea of some of the products manufactured for each market fabrinet was founded in  by david t mitchell who was also a cofounder of seagate technology nasdaqstx mitchell serves as chairman and ceo of the bangkok thailandbased company and with his experience as an executive and his leadership fabrinet has been able to penetrate and thrive in expanding markets now that we have some context for the company lets get to analyzing the actual business the product mix and growth in its most recent conference call fabrinet cfo ts ng broke down the companys revenues by segment as follows   of total revenue attributed to optical communications  telecommunications revenue  data communications revenue   of total revenue attributed to nonoptical communications  laser market revenue  automotive revenue  other revenue each product segment listed here saw yearoveryear yoy growth in q  which indicates that fabrinet is indeed positioned for success by far the most important segment in terms of revenue contribution was optical communications which saw yoy growth of  to  million that growth was driven by strength in both the telecommunications business which grew by  yoy and the data communications business which grew by a whopping  yoy the rapid growth in the datacom and telecom segments has mostly been driven by a shift from gig and gig gigabits per second solutions to gig solutions on the conference call ng said that the weakness from the former products were heavily outweighed by the strength in gig product offerings in fact he said that gig shipments represented twothirds of total optical communication shipments this reflects a growing trend in all communications businesses for increasingly higher bandwidth which fabrinet sees as an indicator of strong future growth in the telecom and more importantly datacom segments of its business while optical communications revenue is currently fabrinets bread and butter the company is still focused on diversifying its revenue streams nonoptical communications revenue represents that diversification and it too saw robust growth in q nonoptical communications revenue increased by  yoy to  million which includes growth in the lasers sensors and other segments laser revenue increased  yoy nonautomotive sensor revenue increased by  yoy and automotive sensor revenue increased as well  yoy with fabrinet firing on all cylinders its no surprise the market reacted by bidding fn up nearly  on tuesday in terms of guidance the company expects q revenue of between  million and  million which represents  and  yoy growth respectively and q eps of between  and  respectively additionally for fullyear  fabrinet expects revenue between  million and  million which represents  and  yoy growth respectively i am very impressed by the companys growth and while the market has already rewarded fn for the outstanding quarterly earnings report i still think the stock has immense potential upside from here lets now dig into fabrinets financials and expected future growth prospects growth markets lets start with the obvious one optical communications for those investors that could have foreseen the gigabit surge coming you could have made a pretty penny on fn and other optical communication product suppliers i unfortunately did not but after doing some research i found the signs in hindsight this article which was written on may th  contained a quote from a man by the name of andrew schmitt who stated the following the market for g data center optics is accelerating but it has yet to be turbocharged by widespread data center deployment in the way g qsfp optics have this will change dramatically in  as cheap g silicon reaches production and qsfp shipments surge as a result next year is going to be huge for gbe schmitt was exactly right in  just tens of thousands of gig solutions were being shipped but that figure is climbing fast the following is a graphic from the mentioned article source opticsorg gig is expected to make up about  of the market by  and those who are well positioned in the market are reaping the benefits schmitt after predicting the rise of gig in  went on to mention a company by the name of oclaro nasdaqoclr as the main beneficiary of this trend over the past twelve months oclr is up  oclr data by ycharts fabrinet has also been reaping these benefits and the shift towards gig appears to have major staying power over the next few years the  jump in datacom revenue yoy was driven by this shift which will continue to spur massive growth the optical telecommunications market is also expected to see continued growth according to research from market research firm markets and markets in  telecom applications comprised  of the optical communication market and this is expected to grow at a rate of  by  in fabrinets investor presentation the company provided the following graph which shows the expected growth of the optical communication market in general telecom is also seeing a shift towards gig connections which should drive fabrinets revenue in the telecom segment and the optical communications segment in general for years as the optical communications portion of the company currently generates  of the revenue it is a fair assessment that the rise of gig solutions for both telecom and datacom applications will continue to drive strong revenue growth i expect top line growth in optical communications to increase about  over the next three years on the shoulders of the push for higherbandwidth connections in the nonoptical communications segment there is also evident growth opportunity for fabrinet laser product revenue was up  yoy and laserfocusworld a laser market research site forecasts total laser market growth of  in  to  billion automotive sensors grew  yoy in q in line with a fairly recent trend of automobiles becoming more complex and requiring more sensors the following bar graph shows expected revenues of the automotive sensor market through  source industry arc fabrinets revenue growth prospects appear very promising mainly within its optical communications business but its less important contributors which the company expects to make up a larger portion of its product mix in the future also have potential now that we have looked at the market opportunities for fabrinet and where revenue growth will come from in the future lets take a look at the companys financials financials fabrinet is a profitable company that earned net income of  million in q and has earned a total of  million through the first three quarters of  if we take the midpoint of managements revenue guidance this yield  million and combined with an expected gross margin around  and operating margin of around  we get q profit estimate of  million finally we get a fullyear  profit estimate of  million that is an impressive  increase from  earnings the boost in income was mostly due to increased revenue from gig shipments which also helped expand the companys gross margin from  in  to an average of around  in  margins stand to continue gradual expansion as the ramp up of gig demand continues for telecom and datacom applications fabrinets balance sheet is also squeaky clean with  million in cash equivalents and shortterm investments and just  million in debt of which just  million is longterm the company has a healthy current ratio of  and the longterm assetstoliabilities ratio of  is even better while the income statement and balance sheet are pristine free cash flow is a work in progress for the nine months ending march   the most recent quarter fabrinet recorded cash inflow from operating activities of  million and capital expenditure of  million free cash flow of  million in  months isnt exactly enamoring but its getting there the company is still likely a long way from paying a dividend and so that budding free cash flow is a sign of things to come as revenue and earnings continue to grow as i believe they will the cash flow will follow closely behind in terms of valuation even after fns nearly  gain over the past  months i think the stock still has more potential upside in the coming months and years if we estimate q net income using fabrinets guidance we get eps for the quarter of  and earnings for  of around  per share at the current share price of  that translates to a pe ratio of  which is fairly low already but when we factor in the companys expected growth the multiple falls significantly we have received no official estimates from fabrinet for beyond q and fullyear  but i will construct conservative estimates using my expectations of earnings growth if we take into consideration that the companys revenue growth was driven by gig shipments which are expected to continue fueling growth we can estimate a sequential average growth rate of  for the four quarters of the coming  fiscal year the companys actual average quarteroverquarter growth rate over the past four quarters has been slightly above  and so this estimate is slightly conservative to keep the estimate conservative we will estimate a profit margin of  which is slightly lower than the companys profit margin on its most recent earnings reports my estimate will begin with the approximately  million fabrinet has guided for q  quarter estimated revenue estimated eps q   million  q   million  q   million  q   million  total  billion  using my conservative metrics i expect  fullyear eps of  which would yield a forward pe of  for fabrinet and when taking into consideration the companys growth beyond  the stock appears extremely undervalued additionally i fully expect fabrinet to beat my  eps estimate i think fn has been flying under the radar for a while now but because of the stocks outstanding returns over the past year it likely wont be unknown for very much longer fabrinet has all the makings of a growth company that is in the right market at the right time i am setting a month price target of  a share on the stock indicating upside potential of  from its current price if you want to stay uptodate on my articles you can follow me by going to my author page or by clicking follow at the top of this page
