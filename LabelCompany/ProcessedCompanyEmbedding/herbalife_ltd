disease inquiriesedit in  israels health minister began an investigation into herbalifes products after four persons using herbalifes products were found to have liver problems herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua kompri and kraska the products were sent to biomedical research design ltd brd to a private us laboratory and to israels forensic research laboratory a study of the cases funded by the israeli ministry of health concluded that a causative relationship is suggested by the evidence which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in

enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and

companies in los angeles county a  settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of  former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of essentially running a pyramid scheme a total of  million was to be paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife sponsors a number of athletes sports teams and sporting events internationally including  world football

which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in  case unlikely and excluded in the other cases thus causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed in a separate review published less than a year earlier the same author described the relationship between herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as highly probable business modeledit a car decorated with herbalife branding parked in london herbalife is a pyramid sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing company in addition to profits from product sales herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited called their downline distributors supporters of mlm contend this is a fair compensation system while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports by january of each year sales leaders are required to requalify in february of each year individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding  months are removed from that rank for the latest month requalification period ending january  approximately  percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified an improvement from  percent in  the company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in los angeles county a  settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of  former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of essentially running a pyramid scheme a total of  million was to be paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife

found to have liver problems herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua kompri and kraska the products were sent to biomedical research design ltd brd to a private us laboratory and to israels forensic research laboratory a study of the cases funded by the israeli ministry of health concluded that a causative relationship is suggested by the evidence which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in  case unlikely and excluded in the other cases thus causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed in a separate review published less than a year earlier the same author described the relationship between herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as highly probable business modeledit a car decorated with herbalife branding parked in london herbalife is a pyramid sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing company in addition to profits from product sales herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited called their downline distributors supporters of mlm contend this is a fair compensation system while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports by january of each year sales leaders are required to requalify in february of each year individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding  months are removed from that rank for the latest month requalification period ending january  approximately  percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified an improvement from  percent in  the company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in los angeles county a  settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of  former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of essentially running a pyramid scheme a total of  million was to be paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife

found to have liver problems herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua kompri and kraska the products were sent to biomedical research design ltd brd to a private us laboratory and to israels forensic research laboratory a study of the cases funded by the israeli ministry of health concluded that a causative relationship is suggested by the evidence which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in  case unlikely and excluded in the other cases thus causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed in a separate review published less than a year earlier the

herbalife is a pyramid sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing company in addition to profits from product sales herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited called their downline distributors supporters of mlm contend this is a fair compensation system while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports by

cited as one of the most profitable companies in los angeles county a  settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of  former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of essentially running a pyramid scheme a total of  million was to be paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife

found to have liver problems herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua kompri and kraska the products were sent to biomedical research design ltd brd to a private us laboratory and to israels forensic research laboratory a study of the cases funded by the israeli ministry of health concluded that a causative relationship is suggested by the evidence which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in  case unlikely and excluded in the other cases thus causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed in a separate review published less than a year earlier the same author described the relationship between herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as highly probable business modeledit a car decorated with herbalife branding parked in london herbalife is a pyramid sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing company in addition to profits from product sales herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited called their downline distributors supporters of mlm contend this is a fair compensation system while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports by january of each year sales leaders are required to requalify in february of each year individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding  months are removed from that rank for the latest month requalification period ending january  approximately  percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified an improvement from  percent in  the company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in los angeles county a  settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of  former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of essentially running a pyramid scheme a total of  million was to be paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife

found to have liver problems herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua kompri and kraska the products were sent to biomedical research design ltd brd to a private us laboratory and to israels forensic research laboratory a study of the cases funded by the israeli ministry of health concluded that a causative relationship is suggested by the evidence which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in  case unlikely and excluded in the other cases thus causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed in a separate review published less than a year earlier the same author described the relationship between herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as highly probable business modeledit a car decorated with herbalife branding parked in london herbalife is a pyramid sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing company in addition to profits from product sales herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited called their downline distributors supporters of mlm contend this is a fair compensation system while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports by january of each year sales leaders are required to requalify in february of each year individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding  months are removed from that rank for the latest month requalification period ending january  approximately  percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified an improvement from  percent in  the company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in los angeles county a  settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of  former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of essentially running a pyramid scheme a total of  million was to be paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife

sanders value longshort equity mediumterm horizon contrariansummaryherbalifes products are expensive relative to other health supplements available inventory turnover is collapsingoperating margins are continuously declining due to inflating sga costsdebt costs are also increasing yearoveryearstock trades at record valuation multiples eg x ttm fcfif you go to amazoncom nasdaqamzn us domestic many of herbalifes hlf products are available two big factors that drive sales for supplemental food products are pricing and brand value for one thing herbalifes brand has been under scrutiny for sometime which has had some impact on the companys sales particular since regulatory authorities around the world have looked into the companys mlm strategy however one core issue that strikes me is the companys pricing strategy if you look at herbalifes protein shakes the main ingredient is soy protein isolate which is a very common ingredient if you do some quick web scraping you will find that comparable products are priced substantially lower for example herbalifes vanilla protein shake prices at oz this compares to oz for gold standard whey protein a  seller and oz for orgain organic plant protein another top seller many other offbrand names also average around oz in other words herbalife is marking up their products and with supplements prices certainly matter it seems like this behavior is impacting their long term strategy interestingly enough management has increased prices across multiple geographies as disclosed in its latest q which includes mexico central and south america emea european countries asia pacific and china price increases are common to keep up with inflation but the problem for herbalife is that net sales for all geographies have been in low single digit decline except for emea north america was the only region spared from a price increase but its net sales have suffered the worst at mid single digit declines it appears that ttm revenue has stabilized somewhat and managements  sales guidance of lsd growth actually suggests a reversal of its multiyear decline however its unclear if the company can actually achieve this goal one good indicator for herbalife is the pace at which it turns inventory hlf inventory turnover ttm data by ycharts this downward trend is likely due to weaker consumer demand it also appears that both north america and centralsouth america will remain as net negatives to worldwide sales in q north america and centralsouth america reported  and  declines in volumes this was mostly offset by gains in china the issue however is that these two geographies are the companys most mature markets which paints an ugly picture for the companys future sales in china and europe are relatively healthy but those trends are likely only temporary cost structure herbalife has built manufacturing facilities over the last few years with the hopes of generating better economies of scale management has referenced some benefits at the gross margin level but how much success can be attributed to this strategy hlf asset utilization ttm data by ycharts what is even more curious is that the sellside is modeling for material sga cost reductions even in the light of that fact that regulators have required higher sales commissions and other structural costs for its operational reorganization management also refinanced its long term credit facility last quarter albeit at a higher rate and still holds its convertible debt bringing total debt to approximately  billion along with this quarterly net interest expenses came out to approximately  million a modest year over year increase from  million the primary driver of its higher costs is due to us prime lending rates if we runrate this figure net interest expenses should approximate  million up from  million last year it seems that the only analysts covering the stock are more bullish than herbalife management for us theres a possibility that  and  eps estimates may need to be revised lower valuation herbalifes valuation multiples have hit all time highs and effectively price in a reasonable amount of earnings growth going forward hlf ev to ebit ttm data by ycharts we are skeptical that all of these adverse events are legitimately oneoff issues with such a compressed yield we think it is worth shorting the equity bottom line herbalife will not blow up overnight given it is a structured enterprise with a very motivated salesforce further management has fully complied with regulators over the last few years which effectively ends the idea that operations will be shut down by force nonetheless a broken business model is not necessarily required for a lucrative short opportunity if management fails to execute well over the next twelve months even a modest guidance shortfall should reverse bullish sentiment short interest is at a  month low and borrowing costs are  at the time of writing thank you for reading and please

health minister began an investigation into herbalifes products after four persons using herbalifes products were found to have liver problems herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua kompri and kraska the products were sent to biomedical research design ltd brd to a private us laboratory and to israels forensic research laboratory a study of the cases funded by the israeli ministry of health concluded that a causative relationship is suggested by the evidence which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in  case unlikely and excluded in the other cases thus causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed in a separate review published less than a year earlier the same author described the relationship between herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as highly probable business modeledit a car decorated with herbalife branding parked in london herbalife is a pyramid sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing company in addition to profits from product sales herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited called their downline distributors supporters of mlm contend this is a fair compensation system while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition

settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of  former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of essentially running a pyramid scheme a total of  million was to be paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife sponsors a number of athletes sports teams and sporting events internationally including  world football

found to have liver problems herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua kompri and kraska the products were sent to biomedical research design ltd brd to a private us laboratory and to israels forensic research laboratory a study of the cases funded by the israeli ministry of health concluded that a causative relationship is suggested by the evidence which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in  case unlikely and excluded in the other cases thus causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed in a separate review published less than a year earlier the same author described the relationship between herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as highly probable business modeledit a car decorated with herbalife branding parked in london herbalife is a pyramid sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing company in addition to profits from product sales herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited called their downline distributors supporters of mlm contend this is a fair compensation system while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition company management considers the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracks it closely in financial reports by january of each year sales leaders are required to requalify in february of each year individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding  months are removed from that rank for the latest month requalification period ending january  approximately  percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified an improvement from  percent in  the company was cited as one of the most profitable companies in los angeles county a  settlement resolved a class action suit on behalf of  former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of essentially running a pyramid scheme a total of  million was to be paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife

health minister began an investigation into herbalifes products after four persons using herbalifes products were found to have liver problems herbalife was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua kompri and kraska the products were sent to biomedical research design ltd brd to a private us laboratory and to israels forensic research laboratory a study of the cases funded by the israeli ministry of health concluded that a causative relationship is suggested by the evidence which included the temporal association between exposure to herbalife products and the development of liver injury the negative evaluation of other potential causes of liver injury the normalization of liver function when herbalife products were discontinued and the return of liver injury symptoms in three patients who resumed using herbalife products after recovery herbalife withdrew one product which was only marketed in israel but not all of the israeli patients had consumed this specific herbalife product herbalifes sec q filings state that the israeli ministry of health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments the israeli ministry of health advises individuals with compromised liver function to avoid dietary supplements in  an israeli woman sued herbalife international and herbalife israel claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of herbalife products scientific studies in  by doctors at the university hospital of bern in switzerland and the liver unit of the hadassahhebrew university medical center in israel found an association between consumption of herbalife products and hepatitis in response the spanish ministry of health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming herbalife products herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with spanish authorities and after investigation the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert hospitals in israel spain switzerland iceland argentina and the united states had reported liver damage in a number of patients some of whom had used herbalife products some patients recovered after they had stopped taking the products while in others the disease continued and two patients died several authors considered it “certain” that herbalife products were the cause of the observed liver disease because of a positive rechallenge while most of the remaining cases were scored as “probable” herbalife employees claim there is no definitive proof that herbalife products cause hepatotoxicity or other liver problems in january  the scientific committee of the spanish agency for food safety and nutrition aesan reached the same conclusion after reviewing cases implicating herbalife products in spain switzerland israel finland france italy iceland and portugal the member scientific panel issued a report concluding the analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship between liver anomalies and herbalifes dietary supplements the panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting however neither a  american association for the study of the liver position paper on the management of acute liver failure nor a  review in the new england journal of medicine lists overzealous dieting among the recognized causes of acute liver failure a july  peerreviewed study published in the world journal of hepatology reexamined known cases of hepatoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of herbalife products and concluded that using the liver specific council for international organizations of medical sciences scale causality was probable in  case unlikely and excluded in the other cases thus causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed in a separate review published less than a year earlier the same author described the relationship between herbalife products and reported hepatoxicity cases as highly probable business modeledit a car decorated with herbalife branding parked in london herbalife is a pyramid sometimes called pyramid scheme or network marketing company in addition to profits from product sales herbalife distributors can earn additional commissions from sales by other distributors they recruited called their downline distributors supporters of mlm contend this is a fair compensation system while critics contend that it is a pyramid scheme critics also argue that the company does not make enough effort to curb abuses by individual distributors though herbalife has consistently denied such allegations herbalife is a member of the direct selling association in most countries in which it operates in its filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec company management note problems with inappropriate business practices in the past their subsequent longlasting effects and the need to avoid any repetition

paid out with defendants not admitting guilt in a california class action suit minton v herbalife international et al filed on february   the plaintiff challenged the marketing practices of certain herbalife international independent distributors and herbalife international under various state laws prohibiting endless chain schemes insufficient disclosure in assisted marketing plans unfair and deceptive business practices and fraud and deceit in a west virginia class action suit mey v herbalife international inc et al filed on july   the plaintiffs allege that some telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of these distributors more specifically the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife internationals distributors used prerecorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpas prohibition of such practices herbalife management insisted they have meritorious defenses in both cases and that in the west virginia case any such distributor actions also went against herbalifes own policies management also contends that any adverse legal outcomes herbalife might suffer would not significantly affect their financial condition particularly since they have already set aside an amount that they believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes the case was resolved with herbalife and its distributors paying  million into a fund for class members part of the suit herbalife international did not acknowledge wrongdoing or admit culpability for the actions of its distributors as of april  a series of commercials featuring a large red animated fox advertising homebased business opportunities has been running on american television the advertisements typically feature testimonials from actors playing individuals who have made sums of money between us and us per month as a result of participating in an undescribed business program the advertisements direct viewers to a website that allows them to purchase a success kit the kit also provides no information about how the business opportunity works these advertisements have been found to be run by independent herbalife distributors as a method of recruiting new downline distributors while it is not illegal critics of this type of advertising prefer advertisers to be upfront about their company associations herbalife nutrition clubsedit while there are many ways to do the herbalife business earlier methods have fallen out of favor over time ie direct mail and internet “lead generation one of the most popular current ways of doing the business is through what is called a nutrition club these clubs are usually storefront shops in densely populated areas often predominantly latino some herbalife distributors complain they have no way of knowing if other clubs are already open in the area one of the reasons for this is that herbalife nutrition clubs can be hard to find since the company doesn’t allow the shop ownermanager to advertise to have awnings to have any visible interior to have an open  closed sign to have a public facing website or indicate in any other way that they are a business they also cannot use the word “herbalife” or shop on the clubs exterior furthermore distributors are disallowed from selling the products directly at the club instead they are to sell a daily membership that entitles the customer to a shake a cup of aloe water and a tea in a styrofoam cup a daily member typically pays  to  in cash for the membership herbalife rules also dictate that no one can leave the club with these products they must be consumed in the club pyramid scheme allegationsedit on december   a belgian appeals court overturned a november  ruling by the commercial court in brussels belgium that herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife responded to the original belgium decision by stating herbalife believes the judgment contains factual errors and is based on misinterpretations of the law and its directselling sales model herbalife remains committed to its pyramid directselling sales model and is confident that with clarifications in certain aspects of its business there will be no doubt as to its compliance with all applicable belgian laws the company filed an appeal on march   in response to the ruling being overturned herbalife said in a statement that it welcomed the judgment by a belgian appeal court that states the company’s sales model is in full compliance with belgian law this judgment overturns a previous ruling by the lower court in response to claims brought by belgian consumer organization testaankoop that herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme herbalife always believed that the first judgment contained factual errors and was based on misinterpretations of its directselling sales method and was confident that the original judgment would be overturned on appeal short salesedit on may   a wellknown short seller david einhorn asked pointed questions about the company’s business and sales models during the q earnings call setting off suspicions that einhorn had a short position these suspicions were proved correct in january  when at an investor meeting einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of  allegations of running a pyramid schemeedit on december   bill ackman of pershing square capital presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that herbalife operates a sophisticated pyramid scheme ackman has alleged after a yearlong investigation that the majority of distributors lose money that the chance of making the testimonialimplied headline income is approximately one in five thousand and that the company materially overstates its distributors retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards to the point that he concludes it is a pyramid scheme according to reuters the sales method under which some people get more money for recruiting new distributors than selling products has attracted criticism ackman claimed that herbalife distributors primarily obtain their monetary benefits from recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services to consumers his firm estimates that since  the scheme has led to more than  billion of total net losses suffered by those at the bottom of the herbalife chain he said on cnbc that millions of low income people around the world hoping to become millionaires are being duped with this scheme and if they knew that the probability is less than  of making a hundred thousand dollars what herbalife calls the millionaires team no one would sign up for it herbalife responded to ackmans  presentation saying it was a malicious attack on herbalifes business model based largely on outdated distorted and inaccurate information herbalife operates with the highest ethical and quality standards and our management and our board are constantly reviewing our business practices and products herbalife also hires independent outside experts to ensure our operations are in full compliance with laws and regulations herbalife is not an illegal pyramid scheme herbalife also countered that ackman based his accusations on a misunderstanding of the companys distributor base at an investor conference in january  the company released results of a nielsen research international survey showing  percent of herbalife distributors never intended to make money by reselling the product instead they wanted to buy products at a discount for personal use to make the distinction clearer the company announced on its june  earnings call that it would begin referring to these discount buyers as members rather than distributors  according to a number of financial commentators ackman bet roughly  billion against the company soon after remarks to the press the price of the stock decreased such that ackman would have made  million if he had closed his short position then ackman stated that he will donate all of his profits from the trade to charity taking the financial incentive out of the equation a few months after ackmans initial comments billionaire investor carl icahn refuted ackmans comment in a very public spat on national tv shortly thereafter icahn bought shares of herbalife intl as icahn continued to buy up hlf shares the stock price continued to show strength by may  icahn owned  of the company that number had declined to  by november  investor george soros and post foods ceo william stiritz also bought large shares of herbalife ackman acknowledged losing – million on his short position in november  by november  soros had sold  million shares  of his stake while perry capital had purchased  million shares by december   stock prices had fallen nearly  to  from their january  high of  on  december  pershing square capital released a  video of a herbalife training conference in which stephan gratziani a member of herbalifes chairmans club sales team was recorded telling an audience of highlevel distributors we sell people on a dream business that they can make it yet deep down inside we know that most of them arent going to along with other statements that pershing described as implying that the business model was not sustainable according to an unnamed source speaking to the new york post the video had previously been subpoenaed by federal investigators in an interview with bloomberg ackman predicted that the company would experience an implosion in  or early  citing federal scrutiny and debt ftc investigationedit based on information from a freedom of information act foia request the new york post reported on february   that herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc released  pages containing  complaints received over a year period in regards to the new york posts foia request after reviewing the nowpublic complaints which the ftc put on its website ackman told the new york post “i have a lot more confidence in our government’s regulators than those who own the stock”  the ftc stated that the wording it used in its response to the foia request was incorrect the ftc could not confirm or deny an investigation into herbalife in march  the ftc opened an investigation into herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of congress herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace and will cooperate fully with the ftc we are confident that herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations” the investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes  to  months in cases like the herbalife investigation the ftc often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as injunctive relief—in order to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers in may  a spokesperson from the ftc told bloomberg that “injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations” in response to speculation that herbalife was close to a resolution with the ftc in july  herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay  million in a settlement with the ftc partial refund checks were mailed to roughly  herbalife distributors in january  the lawsuit alleged that herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company’s products in addition the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of herbalife’s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company’s marketing program rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the ftc act as part of the settlement herbalife agreed to pay distributors based only on actual retail sales of products rather than for recruiting other distributors the ftc had noted that the overwhelming majority of herbalifes distributors earn very little or nothing sports sponsorshipsedit herbalife sponsors a number of athletes sports teams and sporting events internationally including  world football

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples
