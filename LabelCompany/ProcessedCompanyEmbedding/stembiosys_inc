stembiosys inc ceo bob hutchens says the san antonio company has added some crucial… more vwr nasdaqvwr which has its headquarters in radnor pennsylvania is a global player in the life sciences industry hutchens said the company will play a crucial role in stembiosys international expansion “this is a huge deal for us” hutchens told me “early last year we identified the need to significantly increase our sales efforts in the us and canada we also recognized that our limited scope and resources meant that we could not do this alone we needed to find a partner to help us grow” stembiosys initially entered into discussions with vwr in march  hutchens said those talks led to an agreement that will give the san antonio company hundreds more sales personnel and other important marketing resources “the coverage with researchers in the us and canada well get is something we simply could not build on our own” hutchens said he added that the deal also provides stembiosys and its products with a “seal of approval” of sorts because of vwr’s international track record that endorsement is expected to provide an additional boost to stembiosys’ international commercialization efforts currently stembiosys has similar deals with three other companies — funakoshi nextcell and seoulin bioscience those agreements have allowed the san antonio company to penetrate major markets in japan europe and south korea respectively there is no additional distribution deal pending at this point however hutchens said some of stembiosys’ existing agreements could be expanded to cover more
