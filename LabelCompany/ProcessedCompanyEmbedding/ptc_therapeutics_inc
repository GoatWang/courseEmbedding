rare disease drug was just given a ayear price tag but it’s unclear whether that’s an improvement may   at  pm et by emma court corrected corrected ptc therapeutics dmd drug emflaza to cost  a year and launch within the coming weeks ptc therapeutics inc said early monday that it plans to launch the duchenne muscular dystrophy drug emflaza at a price of  a year and within the coming weeks the price tag comes in below the controversial ayear price set by emflazas previous owner privatelyheld marathon pharmaceuticals which faced so much backlash on the drugs price tag that it delayed emflazas launch the price tag was especially controversial because the drug is part of a class of corticosteroids used for dmd in other parts of the world and available as cheaply as  a year ptc therapeutics said it believes the new price is sustainable and balances providing access to all eligible patient in the united states in an ultraorphan population while maintaining sufficient infrastructure and programs including continued investment in duchenne said chief executive officer stuart peltz according to the factset earnings call transcript the factors in our decision include a consideration of the resources required to provide access to emflaza for a small patient population to improve the standard of care and further the duchenne communitys educational need while enabling continual investment in therapies for rare diseases and providing financial return for our shareholders ptc therapeutics announced its plan to buy emflaza in midmarch for about  million in cash and  million in ptc common stock but its possible the new lower price tag may still prove controversial the question is how low is low enough especially when patients and now politicians given all the noise know that the drug is available overseas for year rbc capital markets analyst simos simeonidis said in march ptc therapeutics shares were not yet active in premarket trade on monday shares have

court corrected corrected ptc therapeutics dmd drug emflaza to cost  a year and launch within the coming weeks ptc therapeutics inc said early monday that it plans to launch the duchenne muscular dystrophy drug emflaza at a price of  a year and within the coming weeks the price tag comes in below the controversial ayear price set by emflazas previous owner privatelyheld marathon pharmaceuticals which faced so much backlash on the drugs price tag that it delayed emflazas launch the price tag was especially controversial because the drug is part of a class of corticosteroids used for dmd in other parts of the world and available as cheaply as  a year ptc therapeutics said it believes the new price is sustainable and balances providing access to all eligible patient in the united states in an ultraorphan population while maintaining sufficient infrastructure and programs including continued investment in duchenne said chief executive officer stuart peltz according to the factset earnings call transcript the factors in our decision include a consideration of the resources required to provide access to emflaza for a small patient population to improve the standard of care and further the duchenne communitys educational need while enabling continual investment in therapies for rare diseases and providing financial return for our shareholders ptc therapeutics announced its plan to buy emflaza in midmarch for about  million in cash and  million in ptc common stock but its possible the new lower price tag may still prove controversial the question is how low is low enough especially when patients and now politicians given all the noise know that the drug is available overseas for year rbc capital markets analyst simos simeonidis said in march ptc
