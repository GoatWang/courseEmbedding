yield bonds high yield noninvestment grade bonds are from issuers that are considered to be at greater risk of not paying interest andor returning principal at maturity as a result the issuer will offer a higher yield than a similar bond of a higher credit rating and typically a higher coupon rate to entice investors to take on the added risk open an account reasons to consider high yield bonds higher yields capital appreciation potential find high yield bonds find bonds features benefits credit ratings risks features what makes high yield corporate bonds different from investment grade corporate bonds lower credit ratings high yield bonds have lower ratings due to the potentially greater risk involved this means that interest payments may not be made and even the principal may not be repaid shorter maturities these bonds are typically issued with shorter maturities they are also less likely to have call protection which means that if a company’s financial condition or credit rating improves the issuer can call its outstanding bonds and take advantage of lower funding rates emerging companies while many high yield bonds are issued by former investment grade companies in decline the high yield market also provides financing opportunities for emerging companies seeking working capital for expansion or to fund acquisitions benefits high yield bonds hold the potential for higher returns for two reasons higher coupon rates in general the issuers of high yield bonds are considered less likely to make interest payments than issuers of investment grade corporate debt because investors are being asked to assume this risk high yield bonds tend to come with higher coupon rates which can generate additional investment income capital appreciation potential companies issuing high yield bonds have the potential to turn around their financial standing creating the opportunity for investors to realize capital gains as bond values increase due to improving business conditions or improved credit ratings credit ratings high yield bonds are rated below baa by moody’s or below bbb by sp and fitch the lower credit ratings are assigned based upon the issuer’s ability

of risks associated with investments in foreign sovereign debt risks while it may seem appealing to look at bonds that offer higher yields investors should consider those higher yields to be a sign of potentially greater risk below are some of the potential risks involved with high yield investing default risk historically the risk of default on principal interest or both is greater for high yield bonds than for investment grade bonds moody’s data shows that bonds rated ba had a  probability of defaulting within a year whereas more speculative bonds rated caa–c had a oneyear default probability of more than  investment grade bonds had less than  probability of a default within a year annual speculative grade default rates  –  source moody’s investors service february  credit risk high yield bonds are subject to credit risk which increases as the creditworthiness of the issuer falls it’s important to pay attention to changes in credit quality as less creditworthy bonds are more likely to default on interest payments or principal repayment business cycle risk high yield issuers typically have riskier business strategies and more leveraged balance sheets exposing them to greater risk of default at times of a downturn in business conditions call risk high yield bonds are more likely to have call provisions which means they can be redeemed or paid off at the issuer’s discretion prior to maturity typically an issuer will call a bond when interest rates fall potentially leaving investors with capital losses or losses in income and less favorable reinvestment options prior to purchasing a corporate bond determine whether call provisions exist makewhole calls some bonds give the issuer the right to call a bond but stipulate that redemption occurs at par plus a premium this feature is referred to as a makewhole call the amount of the premium is determined by the yield of a comparable mature treasury security plus additional basis points because the cost to the issuer can often be significant makewhole calls are rarely invoked event risk a bond’s payments are dependent on the issuer’s ability to generate cash flow unforeseen events could impact their ability to meet those commitments concentration risk excessive exposure to a specific market sector within any asset class could put investors at greater risk it’s important to seek diversification across a wide range of issues and industries in order to reduce the negative impact of a default equity correlation risk the perception that high yield issuers may have trouble generating sufficient cash flow to make interest payments could make them behave like equities in some cases high yield bonds may fall along with equities during an economic or stock market downturn this is a concern for investors using fixed income as a hedge against equity volatility liquidity risk high yield bonds that may have been easy to buy or sell when market conditions were calm can suddenly become very difficult to sell when volatility increases typically the market for high yield bonds is less liquid than the market for investment grade or government bonds interest rate risk although high yield bonds have relatively low levels of interest rate risk for a given duration or maturity compared to other bond types this risk can nevertheless be a factor as with all bonds a rise in interest rates causes prices of bonds and bond funds to decline because credit and default risk are the dominant drivers of valuations of high yield bonds changes in market interest rates are relatively less important at the same time a tightening in monetary conditions that usually accompanies a rise in the general level of interest rates may cause a lagging reaction by weaker credits because of their inability to find sufficient funding which in turn weakens the balance sheet of the high yield entity higher transaction costs due to a typically large spread between bid and offer prices and higher transaction costs associated with less liquid securities trading high yield bonds can be costly research and monitoring demands current and accurate information can be more difficult to obtain for high yield bonds investors should conduct due diligence as they consider investment strategies and closely monitor the changing financial condition of the issuing company foreign risk in addition to the risks mentioned above there are additional considerations for bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations these bonds can experience greater volatility due to increased political regulatory market or economic risks these risks are usually more pronounced in emerging markets which may be subject to greater social economic regulatory and political uncertainties investing in high yield bonds at
