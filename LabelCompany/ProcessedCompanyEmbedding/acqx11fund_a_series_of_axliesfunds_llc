classifications these classifications are the exclusive property and service mark of credit suisse ag fund documents prospectus and fund reports fact sheet profile sheet materials  resources investor guide  about risk bank loan risk there are a number of risks associated with an investment in bank loans including credit risk interest rate risk liquidity risk and prepayment risk lack of an active trading market restrictions on resale irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods may impair the funds ability to sell bank loans within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to accurately value existing and prospective investments extended trade settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the fund as a result the fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its obligations the risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks these risks could cause the fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment which in turn could affect the funds returns the value of bank loans can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and to economic downturns in the united states and abroad bank loans generally are floating rate loans which are subject to interest rate risk as the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on changes in widely accepted reference rates borrowing risk borrowing money to buy securities exposes the fund to leverage and will cause the funds share price to be more volatile because leverage will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the funds portfolio securities borrowing money may also require the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so in addition the fund will incur interest expenses and other fees on borrowed money there can be no assurance that the funds borrowing strategy will enhance and not reduce the funds returns changing fixed income market conditions risk the current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero there is a risk that interest rates will rise when the frb and central banks raise these rates this risk is heightened due to the completion of the frbs quantitative easing program and the tapering of other similar foreign central bank actions this eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs collateralized loan obligations risk clos are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress clos may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches market anticipation of defaults and investor aversion to clo securities as a class the risks of clos will be greater if the fund invests in clos that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the fund holds subordinate tranches of the clo that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches in addition clos are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk credit linked notes risk risks of credit linked notes include those risks associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited to market risk interest rate risk credit risk default risk and in some cases foreign currency risk an investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the structured security credit linked notes may be less liquid than other investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and price in addition credit linked notes may be leveraged and as a result small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may produce disproportionate losses to the fund debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event defaulted securities risk defaulted securities pose a greater risk that principal will not be repaid than nondefaulted securities defaulted securities and any securities received in an exchange for such securities may be subject to restrictions on resale derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions financial services sector risk the fund may be susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial services sector financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable interest rates each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such companies financial services companies may also have concentrated portfolios which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic conditions foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful high yield debt securities junk bond risk investments in high yield debt securities junk bonds and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the funds securities become illiquid the fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value risk of subordinated debt perpetual subordinated debt is a type of hybrid instrument that has no maturity date for the return of principal and does not need to be redeemed by the issuer these investments typically have lower credit ratings and lower priority than other obligations of an issuer during bankruptcy presenting a greater risk for nonpayment this risk increases as the priority of the obligation becomes lower payments on these securities may be subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of subsidiaries and associated companies of an issuer additionally some perpetual subordinated debt does not restrict the ability of an issuer’s subsidiaries to incur further unsecured indebtedness as of  afrax nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is usually updated between  and  pm cst as of  yieldnbsp distribution yield with sales

security transactions holdings are subject to change  inception date is  you should consider the funds investment objectives risks and charges and expenses carefully before investing you can download a prospectus or summary prospectus or contact first trust portfolios lp at  to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund the prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing the fund is subject to the following risks you could lose money by investing in the fund there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objectives a mutual funds share price and investment return will vary with market conditions and the principal value of an investment when you sell your shares may be more or less than the original cost consumer discretionary companies risk consumer discretionary companies are companies that provide nonessential goods and services such as retailers media companies and consumer services these companies manufacture products and provide discretionary services directly to the consumer and the success of these companies is tied closely to the performance of the overall domestic and international economy interest rates competition and consumer confidence success depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and success of consumer discretionary products in the marketplace cyber security risk as the use of internet technology has become more prevalent in the course of business the fund has become more susceptible to potential operational risks through breaches in cyber security a breach in cyber security refers to both intentional and unintentional events that may cause the fund to lose proprietary information suffer data corruption or lose operational capacity such events could cause the fund to incur regulatory penalties reputational damage additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures andor financial loss cyber security breaches may involve unauthorized access to the funds digital information systems through hacking or malicious software coding but may also result from outside attacks such as denialofservice attacks through efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users in addition cyber security breaches of the funds third party service providers such as its administrator transfer agent custodian or subadvisor as applicable or issuers in which the fund invests can also subject the fund to many of the same risks associated with direct cyber security breaches the fund has established risk management systems designed to reduce the risks associated with cyber security however there is no guarantee that such efforts will succeed especially because the fund does not directly control the cyber security systems of issuers or third party service providers equity securities risk because the fund invests in equity securities the value of the funds shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of these equity securities equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as market volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur in addition common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase information technology companies risk information technology companies are generally subject to the following risks rapidly changing technologies short product life cycles fierce competition aggressive pricing and reduced profit margins the loss of patent copyright and trademark protections cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions information technology companies may be smaller and less experienced companies with limited product lines markets or financial resources and fewer experienced management or marketing personnel information technology company stocks particularly those that are internet related have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to their operating performance liquidity risk the fund invests in equity securities that may have limited liquidity despite being listed on a securities exchange equity securities that are less liquid or that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy or to sell compared to other more liquid or active investments this liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular security as well as the size and liquidity of the market for such security the prices at which the equity securities are held in the fund will be adversely affected if trading markets for the equity securities are limited or absent market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund or shares of the fund in general may fall in value securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic political regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices shares of the fund could decline in value or underperform other investments model risk the fund relies heavily on a proprietary quantitative model that uses information and data supplied by third parties when the model and data prove to be incorrect or incomplete any decisions made in reliance thereon expose the fund to potential risks small fund risk the fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds and like other relatively smaller funds large inflows and outflows may impact the funds market exposure for limited periods of time this impact may be positive or negative depending on the direction of market movement during the period affected smaller companies risk the fund invests in small andor midcapitalization companies such companies may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and their securities may be less liquid and may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies as a result of several factors including limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information accordingly such companies are generally subject to greater market risk than larger more established companies value investing risk the fund focuses its investments on securities that the portfolio managers believe are undervalued or inexpensive relative to other investments these types of securities may present risks in addition to the general risks associated with investing in them these securities generally are selected on the basis of an issuers business and economic fundamentals or the securities current and projected credit profiles relative to current market price such securities are subject to the risk of misestimating certain fundamental factors disciplined adherence to a value investment mandate during periods in which that style is out of favor can result in significant underperformance relative to overall market indices and other managed investment vehicles that pursue growth style investments andor flexible style mandates aqa® is a registered trademark of jjb
