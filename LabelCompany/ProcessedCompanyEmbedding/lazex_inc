below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment     risks related to our business   because our auditors have raised a going concern there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment   we may continue to lose money and if we do not achieve profitability we may not be able to continue our business   we are company with limited operations have incurred expenses and have losses in addition we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not occur we expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion even if we do achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we expect to have quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues expenses losses and cash flow some of which could be significant results of operations will depend upon numerous factors some beyond our control including regulatory actions market acceptance of our products and services new products and service introductions and competition   page       we are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available   our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations we need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the “plan of operation” section of this prospectus as of july   we had cash in the amount of  and liabilities of  as of this date we have no income and just recently started our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us   we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from iuliia gitelman our sole officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however ms gitelman has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company after one year we may need additional financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding to pay for ongoing sec filing requirements we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing   if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations   we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future   we were incorporated on july   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail   we have limited sales and marketing experience which increases the risk that our business will fail   we have no experience in the touristic consultation business marketing and have only nominal sales and marketing experience our future success will depend among other factors upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that service will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services   page     we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of niche of the touristic consultation business is very competitive barriers to entry are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected   some of our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to dominate the market which may affect our ability to generate revenues some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized they could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development as well as marketing and production we might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance we have no customers and we cannot guarantee future customers even if we obtain customers there is no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit if that occurs we will have to cease operations   we have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract futurecustomers even if we obtain customers for our service there is no guarantee that we will make a profit if we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations   because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations   due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations   because our sole officer and director will own more than  of our outstanding common stock she will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders   ms gitelman our sole officer and director will own more than  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly she will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of ms gitelman may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders   we depend to a significant extent on certain key person the loss of whom may materially and adversely affect our company   currently we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director we depend entirely on iuliia gitelman for all of our operations the loss of ms gitelman would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail ms gitelman has not been compensated for her services since our incorporation and it is highly unlikely that she will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues there is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms the loss of ms gitelman’s services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business in the event of the loss of services of such personnel no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel   page     we do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with her or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future   because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations this activity could prevent us from attracting enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause us to cease operations   iuliia gitelman our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operationsshe will be devoting approximately  hours a week to our operations because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations   our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting   we have never operated as a public company iuliia gitelman our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected     as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements    we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to    have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s report on the effectiveness ofourinternal controls overfinancial reporting  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as “sayonpay” and “sayonfrequency” and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive’s compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards     page     we will remain an

can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period
