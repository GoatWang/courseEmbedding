its first appearance on the nora stone where the word šrdn testifies to the names existence when the phoenician merchants first arrived according to timaeus one of platos dialogues sardinia and its people as well might have been named after sardò σαρδώ a legendary woman born in sardis σάρδεις capital of the ancient kingdom of lydia there has also been speculation that identifies the ancient nuragic sards with the sherden one of the sea peoples it is suggested that the name had a religious connotation from its use also as the adjective for the ancient sardinian mythological herogod sardus pater sardinian father in modern times misunderstood as being father sardus as well as being the stem of the adjective sardonic in classical antiquity sardinia was called ichnusa the latinised form of ancient greek υκνούσσα σανδάλιον sandal sardinia and sardó σαρδώ geographyedit topographic map of sardinia the southern coast of corsica as seen from santa teresa gallura cala goloritzé baunei view of

straight stretches of coastline many outstanding headlands a few wide deep bays rias many inlets and with various smaller islands off the coast the island has an ancient geoformation and unlike sicily and mainland italy is not earthquakeprone its rocks date in fact from the palaeozoic era up to  million years old due to long erosion processes the islands highlands formed of granite schist trachyte

rainfalls the climate of the island is variable from area to area due to several factors including the extension in latitude and the elevation it can be classified in two different macrobioclimates mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and temperate oceanic one macrobioclimatic variant called submediterranean and four classes of continentality from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental eight thermotypic horizons from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate and seven ombrotypic horizons from lower dry to lower hyperhumid resulting in a combination of  different isobioclimates during the year there is a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn some heavy showers in the spring and snowfalls in the highlands the average temperature is between  to  °c  to  °f with mild winters and hot summers on the coasts   to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july and cold winters and cool summers on the mountains  − to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july rainfall has a mediterranean distribution all over the island with almost totally rainless summers and wet autumns winters and springs however in summer the rare rainfalls can be characterized by short but severe thunderstorms which can cause flash floods the climate is also heavily influenced by the vicinity of the gulf of genoa barometric low and the relative proximity of the atlantic ocean low pressures in autumn can generate the formation of the socalled medicanes extratropical cyclones which affect the mediterranean basin in  the island was hit by several cyclones included the cyclone cleopatra which dumped almost  inches  mm of rainfall within an hour and a half sardinia being relatively large and hilly weather is not uniform in particular the east is drier but paradoxically it suffers the worst rainstorms  in autumn  it rained more than  mm  in in a single day in siniscola and  november  locations in sardinia were reported to have received more than  mm  inches within two hours the western coast has a higher distribution of rainfalls even for modest elevations for instance iglesias elevation  m  ft average annual precipitation  mm  in the driest part of the island is the coast of cagliari gulf with less than  mm  in per year the minimum is at capo carbonara at the extreme southeast of the island  mm  in and the wettest is the top of the gennargentu mountain with almost  mm  in per year the average for the entire island is about  mm  in per year which is more than enough for the needs of the population and vegetation the mistral from the northwest is the dominant wind on and off throughout the year though it is most prevalent in winter and spring it can blow quite strongly but it is usually dry and cool climate data for cagliari

is one of the most geologically ancient bodies of land in europe the island was populated in various waves of immigration from prehistory until recent times the first people to settle in sardinia during the upper paleolithic and the mesolithic came probably from the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula the paleolithic colonization of the island is demonstrated by the evidences in olienas corbeddu cave in the mesolithic some populations particularly from presentday tuscany managed to move to northern sardinia via corsica the neolithic revolution was introduced in the th millennium bc by the cardial culture coming from the italian peninsula in the midneolithic period the ozieri culture probably of aegean origin flourished on the island spreading the hypogeum tombs known as domus de janas while the arzachena culture of gallura built the first megaliths circular tombs in the early rd millennium bc began to develop the metallurgy of copper and silver  during the late chalcolithic the socalled beaker culture coming from continental europe appeared in sardinia these new people predominantly settled on the west coast where the majority of the sites attributed to them had been found the beaker culture was followed in the early bronze age by the bonnanaro culture which showed both reminiscences of the beaker and influences by the polada culture as time passed the different sardinian populations appear to have become united in customs yet remained politically divided into various small tribal groupings at times banding together and at others waging war against each other habitations consisted of round thatched stone huts nuraghe losa nuragic civilizationedit main article nuragic civilization from about  bc onwards villages were built around round towerfortresses called nuraghi singular form nuraghe usually pluralized in english as nuraghes these towers were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements tribal boundaries were guarded by smaller lookout nuraghes erected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories today some  nuraghes dot the sardinian landscape while initially these nuraghes had a relatively simple structure with time they became extremely complex and monumental see for example nuraghe santu antine su nuraxi or nuraghe arrubiu the scale complexity and territorial spread of these buildings attest to the level of wealth accumulated by the nuragic people their advances in technology and the complexity of their society which was able to coordinate large numbers of people with different roles for the purpose of building the monumental nuraghes giants grave in dorgali bronze age the nuraghes are not the only nuragic buildings that survive as there are several sacred wells around sardinia and other buildings that had religious purposes such as the giants grave monumental collective tombs and collections of religious buildings that probably served as destinations for pilgrimage and mass religious rites eg su romanzesu near bitti head of one of the socalled giants of monte prama sardinia was at the time at the centre of several commercial routes and it was an important provider of raw materials such as copper and lead which were pivotal for the manufacture of the time by controlling the extraction of these raw materials and by commercing them with other countries the nuragic civilisation was able to accumulate wealth and reach a level of sophistication that is not only reflected in the complexity of its surviving buildings but also in its artworks eg the votive bronze statuettes found across sardinia according to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with the sherden a tribe of the sea peoples the nuragic civilization was linked with other contemporaneous megalithic civilization of the western mediterranean such as the talaiotic culture of the balearic islands and the torrean civilization of south corsica evidence of trade with the other civilizations of the time is attested by several artefacts eg pots coming from as far as cyprus crete mainland greece spain and italy that have been found in nuragic sites bearing witness to the scope of commercial relations between the nuragic people and other peoples in europe and beyond ancient historyedit the phoenician and subsequently roman town of tharros necropolis of tuvixeddu cagliari around the th century bc the phoenicians began visiting sardinia with increasing frequency presumably initially needing safe overnight andor allweather anchorages along their trade routes from the coast of modernday lebanon as far afield as the african and european atlantic coasts and beyond the most common ports of call were caralis nora bithia sulci and tharros claudian a thcentury latin poet in his poem de bello gildonico stated that caralis was founded by people from tyre probably in the same time of the foundation of carthage in the th or th century bc in the th century bc after the conquest of western sicily the carthaginians planned to annex sardinia a first invasion attempt led by malco was foiled by the victorious nuraghic resistance however from  bc the southern and westcentral part of the island was invaded a second time and came under carthaginian rule roman thermae of forum traiani in what is now fordongianus in  bc taking advantage of carthage having to face a rebellion of her mercenaries the mercenary war after the first punic war – bc the romans annexed corsica and sardinia from the carthaginians the two islands became the province of corsica and sardinia they were not given a provincial governor until  bc the romans faced many rebellions and it took them many years to pacify both islands the existing coastal cities were enlarged and embellished and roman colonies such as turris lybissonis and feronia were founded these were populated by roman immigrants the roman military occupation brought the nuragic civilization to an end except for the mountainous interior of the island which the romans called barbaria meaning “barbarian land” roman rule in sardinia lasted  years during which time the province was an important source of grain for the capital latin came to be the dominant spoken language during this period though roman culture was slower to take hold and roman rule was often contested by the sardinian tribes from the mountainous regions vandal conquestedit a vandalperiod coin found in sardinia depicting godas latin legend  rex cvda the east germanic tribe of the vandals conquered sardinia in  their rule lasted for  years up to  when  eastern roman troops led by cyril one of the officers of the foederati retook the island it is known that the vandal government continued the forms of the existing roman imperial structure the governor of sardinia continued to be called the praeses and apparently continued to manage military judicial and civil governmental functions via imperial procedures the only vandal governor of sardinia about whom there is substantial record is the last godas a visigoth noble in ad  a coup détat in carthage removed king hilderic a convert to nicene christianity in favor of his cousin gelimer an arian christian like most of the élite in his kingdom godas was sent to take charge and ensure the loyalty of sardinia he did the exact opposite declaring the islands independence from carthage and opening negotiations with emperor justinian i who had declared war on hilderics behalf in ad  gelimer sent the bulk of his army and navy  vessels and  men to sardinia to subdue godas with the catastrophic result that the vandal kingdom was overwhelmed when justinians own army under belisarius arrived at carthage in their absence the vandal kingdom ended and sardinia was returned to roman rule byzantine era and the rise of the giudicatiedit in  sardinia returned to the rule of the byzantine empire when the vandals were defeated by the armies of justinian i under the general belisarius in the battle of tricamarum in their african kingdom belisarius sent his general cyril to sardinia to retake the island sardinia remained in byzantine hands for the next  years aside from a short period in which it was invaded by the ostrogoths in  under byzantine rule the island was divided into districts called mereíai μερείαι in byzantine greek which were governed by a judge residing in caralis and garrisoned by an army stationed in forum traiani today fordongianus under the command of a dux during this time christianity took deeper root on the island supplanting the paganism which had survived into the early middle ages in the culturally conservative hinterlands along with lay christianity the followers of monastic figures such as basil of caesarea became established in sardinia while christianity penetrated the majority of the population the region of barbagia remained largely pagan and probably partially nonlatin speaking they reestablished a shortlived independent domain with sardinianheathen lay and religious traditions one of its kings being hospito pope gregory i wrote a letter to hospito defining him dux barbaricinorum and being christian the leader and best of his people in this unique letter about hospito the pope prompts him to convert his people who “living all like irrational animals ignore the true god and worship wood

of byzantine rule in sardinia are not known direct central control was maintained at least through c  after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of gregory the patrician exarch of africa and the first invasion of the muslim conquest of the maghreb there is some evidence that senior byzantine administration in the exarchate of africa retreated to caralis following the final fall of carthage to the arabs in  the loss of imperial control in africa led to escalating raids by moors and berbers on the island the first of which is documented in  forcing increased military selfreliance in the province communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the muslim conquest of sicily between  and  a letter by pope nicholas i as early as  mentions the sardinian judges without reference to the empire and a letter by pope john viii reigned – refers to them as principes princes by the time of de administrando imperio completed in  the byzantine authorities no longer listed sardinia as an imperial province suggesting they considered it lost in all likelihood a local noble family acceded to the power still identifying themselves as vassals of the byzantines but de facto independent as communications with constantinople were very difficult we know only two names of those rulers salusios σαλούσιος and the protospatharios turcoturios tουρκοτούριος from two inscriptions who probably reigned between the th and the th century these rulers were still closely linked to the byzantines both for a pact of ancient vassalage and from the ideological point of view with the use of the greek language in a country of the romance language and the use of art of byzantine inspiration the medieval basilica of san gavino in porto torres th century frescoes in the basilica di saccargia in codrongianos in the early th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by muslims based in spain the only records of that war are from pisan and genoese chronicles the christians won but after that the previous sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four small giudicati cagliari calari arborea arbaree gallura torres or logudoro whether this final transformation from imperial civil servant to independent sovereign resulted from imperial abandonment or local assertion by the th century the giudici sardinian judikes  latin iudices literally judges a byzantine administrative title had emerged as the autonomous rulers of sardinia the title of iudice changed with the language and local understanding of the position becoming the sardinian judike essentially a king or sovereign while giudicato sardinian judicadu literally ‘judgeship’ or ‘judicature’ came to mean state a letter by mieszko i of poland to pope john xv proves that the giudicati were known even in poland and that they played an important role in medieval europe early medieval sardinian political institutions evolved from the millennium old roman imperial structures with relatively little germanic influence although the giudicati were hereditary lordships the old byzantine imperial notion that personal title or honor was separate from the state still remained so the giudicato was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later european feudalism like the imperial systems the new order also preserved semidemocratic forms with national assemblies called the crown of the realm each giudicato saw to its own defense maintained its own laws and administration and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs the history of the four giudicati would be defined by the contest for influence between the rival rising sea powers of genoa and pisa and later the ambitions of the kingdom of aragon sardinian giudicati the giudicato of cagliari or pluminos during the regency of torchitorio v of cagliari and his successor william iii was allied with the republic of genoa for this it was brought to an end in  when its capital santa igia was stormed and destroyed by an alliance of sardinian and pisan forces the territory then was divided between republic of pisa the della gherardesca family and the giudicati of arborea and gallura pisa maintained the control over the fortress of castel di cagliari founded by pisan merchants in  east of santa igia in the southwest the count ugolino della gherardesca promoted the birth of the town of villa di chiesa today iglesias to exploit the nearby rich silver deposits the giudicato of logudoro sometimes called torres was also allied to the republic of genoa and came to an end in  after the death of the judikessa queen adelasia the territory was divided up between the doria and malaspina families of genoa and the basserra family of arborea while the city of sassari became a small republic like the italian citystates comuni confederated firstly with pisa and then with genoa the giudicato of gallura ended in the year  when the last giudice nino visconti a friend of dante alighieri was driven out by the pisans who occupied the territory the giudicato of arborea having oristano as its capital had a longer life compared to the other kingdoms its later history is entwined with the attempt to unify the island into a single sardinian state republica sardisca against their relatives and former aragonese allies aragonese periodedit in  pope boniface viii established on his own initiative motu proprio a hypothetical regnum sardiniae et corsicae kingdom of sardinia and corsica in order to settle the war of the sicilian vespers diplomatically this had broken out in  between the capetian house of anjou and catalans over the possession of sicily despite the existence of the indigenous states the pope offered this newly created crown to james ii of aragon promising him support should he wish to conquer pisan sardinia in exchange for sicily the proclamation of the republic of sassari the sassarese republic lasted from  until  when it sided with the new born kingdom of sardinia in  in alliance with the kingdom of arborea and following a military campaign that lasted a year or so the aragon crown prince alfonso led a catalan army that occupied the pisan territories of cagliari and gallura along with the allied city of sassari naming them the kingdom of sardinia and corsica the kingdom was to remain a dominion of the crown of aragon under the kings of spain until the treaty of utrecht during this period the giudicato of arborea promulgated the legal code of the kingdom in the carta de logu ‘charter of the land’ the carta de logu was originally compiled by marianus iv of arborea and was amended and updated by marianos daughter female judge judikessa or juighissa eleanor of arborea the legal code was written in sardinian and established a whole range of citizens rights among the revolutionary concepts in this carta de logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property in terms of civil liberties the code made provincial th century sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of europe in  peter iv of aragon following aragonese customs granted a parliament to the kingdom of sardinia and corsica which was followed by some degree of selfgovernment under a viceroy and judicial independence this parliament however had limited powers it consisted of highranking military commanders the clergy and the nobility the kingdom of aragon also introduced the feudal system into the areas of sardinia that it ruled the sardinian giudicati never adopted feudalism and arborea maintained its parliament called the corona de logu crown of the realm in this parliament apart from the nobles and military commanders also sat the representatives of each township and village the corona de logu exercised some control over the king under the rule of the bannus consensus the king could be deposed or even executed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom statue of judichessa eleanor of arborea in oristano broken the alliance with the crown of aragon from  to  the arborean giudici marianus iv hugh iii and brancaleone doria husband of eleanor of arborea succeeded in occupying all of sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the castle of cagliari and alghero which for years remained as the only aragonese dominions in sardinia in  martin i of sicily king of sicily and heir to the crown of aragon defeated the sardinians at the battle of sanluri the battle was fought by about  sardinian genoese and french knights enrolled from their kingdom at a time when the population of sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague despite the sardinian army outnumbering the aragonese army they were defeated the giudicato of arborea disappeared in  when its rights were sold by the last king for  gold florins and after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges for example leonardo cubello with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the kings of arborea was granted the title of marquis of oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the kingdom of arborea in exchange for his subjection to the aragonese monarchs the conquest of sardinia by the kingdom of aragon meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout sardinia thus sardinia is probably the only european country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the middle ages to the early modern period at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other european countries spanish periodedit flag of the kingdom of sardinia center at the funeral of charles i of spain in  the heir to sardinia ferdinand ii of aragon married isabel of castile and

in order to defend their mediterranean territories from raids of the barbary pirates fortified the sardinian shores with a system of coastal lookout towers allowing the gradual resettlement of some coastal areas the kingdom of sardinia remained aragonesespanish for about  years from  to  assimilating a number of spanish traditions customs and linguistic expressions nowadays vividly portrayed in

entire villages were devastated savoyard periodedit in  as a consequence of the spanish war of succession the rule of the kingdom of sardinia passed from king philip v of spain into the hands of the austrians who occupied the island the treaty of utrecht granted sardinia to the austrians but in  cardinal giulio alberoni minister of philip v of spain reoccupied sardinia in  with the treaty of london sardinia was handed over to the house of savoy that would impose the italian language on the island in  the french siege of cagliari and quartu in  sardinians repelled two french invasions on  february  domenico millelire commanding the sardinian fleet defeated the fleets of the french republic near the maddalena archipelago of which thenlieutenant napoleon bonaparte was a leader millelire became the first recipient of the gold medal of military valor of the italian armed forces in the same month sardinians stopped the attempted french landing on the beach of quartu santelena near the capital of cagliari because of these successes the representatives of nobility and clergy stamenti formulated five requests addressed to the king victor amadeus iii of sardinia but they got refused because of this discontent on  april  during an uprising in cagliari two savoyard officials were killed that was the start of a revolt called the sardinian vespers in the island which culminated on  april  commemorated today as sa die de sa sardigna with the expulsion or even execution of the piedmontese officers for a few days from the capital cagliari gm angioy entry into sassari on  december  in sassari insurgents demonstrating against feudalism mainly from the region of logudoro occupied the city on  february  in order to prevent the spread of the revolt the viceroy filippo vivalda gave the sardinian magistrate giovanni maria angioy the role of alternos which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself angioy moved from cagliari to sassari and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising demanding an end to feudalism and aiming to declare the island to be an independent republic but once he was outnumbered by loyalist forces he fled to paris and sought support for a french annexation of the island in  the islet near sardinia was attacked by the tunisians and over  inhabitants were taken away as slaves the final muslim attack on the island was on santantioco on  october  over a millennium since the first in  as a consequence of the napoleonic wars in italy the savoy royal family left turin and took refuge in cagliari for some fifteen years in  the sardinian parliaments stamenti in order to get the piedmontese liberal reforms they could not afford due to their separated legal system renounced their state autonomy and agreed to form a union with piedmont savoy nice and liguria in order to have a single parliament a single magistracy and a single government in turin this move aggravated the islands peripheral condition and most of the prounion supporters including its leader giovanni siotto pintor would later regret it sardinians wearing traditional clothing s in  the savoyards imposed the enclosures act editto delle chiudende on the island aimed at turning the lands traditional collective ownership a cultural and economic cornerstone of sardinia since the nuragic times to private property this gave rise to many abuses as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor sardinian farmers and shepherds who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land many local rebellions like the nuorese su connottu the already known in sardinian riot in  all repressed by the kings army resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land however the common lands called ademprivios were never completely abolished and they are still present in large number to this day  hectares of common lands were counted in  of which  constituted by woods in  the confederation of states powered by the savoyard kings of sardinia became a unitarian and constitutional state and moved to the italian wars of independence for the unification of italy that were led for thirteen years in  being italy united by a debated war campaign the parliament of the kingdom of sardinia decided by law to change its name and the title of its king in kingdom of italy and king of italy most sardinian forests were cut down at this time in order to provide the piedmontese with raw materials like wood used to make railway sleepers on the mainland the extension of the primary natural forests praised by every traveller visiting sardinia would in fact be reduced to  of their original number being little more than  hectares at the end of the century during the first world war the sardinian soldiers of the brigata sassari distinguished themselves it was the first and only regional military unit in italy since the people enrolled were only sardinians the regiment suffered heavy losses and earned four gold metals sardinia lost more young people than any other italian region on the front with  casualties per  soldiers compared to the italian average of  casualties during the fascist period with the implementation of the policy of autarky several swamps around the island were reclaimed and agrarian communities founded the main communities were the village of mussolinia now called arborea populated by farmers from veneto and friuli in the area of oristano and fertilia populated at first by settlers from the ferrara area followed after world war ii by a notable number of istrian italians and dalmatian italians hailing from territories lost to yugoslavia in the area adjacent the city of alghero within the region of nurra  also established during that time  was the city of carbonia which became the main centre of coal mining activity that attracted thousand of workers from the rest of the island and the italian mainland the sardinian writer grazia deledda won

with the initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island these included the construction of new dams and roads reforestation agricultural zones on reclaimed marshland and large industrial complexes primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations with the creation of petrochemical industries thousands of exfarmers became industrial workers the  oil crisis caused the termination of employment for thousands of workers employed in the petrochemical industries which aggravated the emigration already present in the s and s sardinia faced the creation of military bases on the island like decimomannu air base and salto di quirra the biggest scientific military base in europe in the same decades even now around  of all italian and nato military installations in italy are on sardinia whose area is less than onetenth of all the italian territory and whose population is little more than the  furthermore they comprise over  hectares used for experimental weapons testing where  of the military explosives in italy are used sardinian nationalism and local protest movements became stronger in the s and a number of bandits anonima sarda started a long series of kidnappings which ended only in the s this also gave rise to various militant groups that blended separatist and communist ideas the most famous being barbagia rossa and the sardinian armed movement which perpetrated several bombings and terrorist actions between the s and the s in the span of just two years –  bombing attacks were reported santo stefanos former nato naval base in  a prominent activist of a separatist party the sardinian action party partidu sardu – partito sardo dazione was elected president of the regional parliament and in the s several other movements calling for

been influenced by catalan spanish and recently italian while the once spoken nuragic contributes many features to it in many ancient remnants in  the regional administration has approved the use of a standardised writing system the socalled limba sarda comuna in official acts as a literary language sardinian is gaining importance despite heated debate about the lack of a commonly acknowledged standard orthography and controversial proposed solutions to this problem the two most widely spoken forms of the language are the southern dialects known as campidanese sardu campidanesu and the northern dialects known as logudorese sardu logudoresu extending almost to the suburbs of sassari the sardinian language is quite different from the other romance languages and is homogeneous in terms of morphology syntax and lexicon but it also shows a spectrum of variation in terms of phonetics between the northern and the southern dialects sassarese sassaresu and gallurese gadduresu are

testifies to the names existence when the phoenician merchants first arrived according to timaeus one of platos dialogues sardinia and its people as well might have been named after sardò σαρδώ a legendary woman born in sardis σάρδεις capital of the ancient kingdom of lydia there has also been speculation that identifies the ancient nuragic sards with the sherden one of the sea peoples it is suggested that the name had a religious connotation from its use also as the adjective for the ancient sardinian mythological herogod sardus pater sardinian father in modern times misunderstood as being father sardus as well as being the stem of the adjective sardonic in classical antiquity sardinia was called ichnusa the latinised form of ancient greek υκνούσσα σανδάλιον sandal sardinia and sardó σαρδώ geographyedit topographic map of sardinia the southern coast of corsica as seen from santa teresa gallura cala goloritzé baunei view of gennargentu the highest massif of sardinia a proportionate graph of sardinian topography  of the island is mountainous  is flat and  is hilly sardinia is the secondlargest island in the mediterranean sea after sicily and before cyprus with an area of  square kilometres  sq mi it is situated between °  and °  latitude north respectively isola del toro and isola la presa and °  and °  east longitude respectively capo dellargentiera and capo comino to the west of sardinia is the sea of sardinia a unit of the mediterranean sea to sardinias east is the tyrrhenian sea which is also an element of the mediterranean sea lake omodeo the largest reservoir in italy the nearest land masses are clockwise from north the island of corsica the italian peninsula sicily tunisia the balearic islands and provence the tyrrhenian sea portion of the mediterranean sea is directly to the east of sardinia between the sardinian east coast and the west coast of the italian mainland peninsula the strait of bonifacio is directly north of sardinia and separates sardinia from the french island of corsica the coasts of sardinia  kilometres  miles long are generally high and rocky with long relatively straight stretches of coastline many outstanding headlands a few wide deep bays rias many inlets and with various smaller islands off the coast the island has an ancient geoformation and unlike sicily and mainland italy is not earthquakeprone its rocks date in fact from the palaeozoic era up to  million years old due to long erosion processes the islands highlands formed of granite schist trachyte basalt called jaras or gollei sandstone and dolomite limestone called tonneri or heels average at between  to  metres  to  feet the highest peak is punta la marmora perdas carpìas in sardinian language m  ft part of the gennargentu ranges in the centre of the island other mountain chains are monte limbara  m  ft in the northeast the chain of marghine and goceano  m  ft running crosswise for  kilometres  miles towards the north the monte albo  m  ft the sette fratelli range in the southeast and the sulcis mountains and the monte linas  m  ft the islands ranges and plateaux are separated by wide alluvial valleys and flatlands the main ones being the campidano in the southwest between oristano and cagliari and the nurra in the northwest sardinia has few major rivers the largest being the tirso  km  mi long which flows into the sea of sardinia the coghinas  km and the flumendosa  km there are  artificial lakes and dams that supply water and electricity the main ones are lake omodeo and lake coghinas the only natural freshwater lake is lago di baratz a number of large shallow saltwater lagoons and pools are located along the  km  mi of the coastline climateedit sardinia average rainfalls the climate of the island is variable from area to area due to several factors including the extension in latitude and the elevation it can be classified in two different macrobioclimates mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and temperate oceanic one macrobioclimatic variant called submediterranean and four classes of continentality from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental eight thermotypic horizons from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate and seven ombrotypic horizons from lower dry to lower hyperhumid resulting in a combination of  different isobioclimates during the year there is a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn some heavy showers in the spring and snowfalls in the highlands the average temperature is between  to  °c  to  °f with mild winters and hot summers on the coasts   to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july and cold winters and cool summers on the mountains  − to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july rainfall has a mediterranean distribution all over the island with almost totally rainless summers and wet autumns winters and springs however in summer the rare rainfalls can be characterized by short but severe thunderstorms which can cause flash floods the climate is also heavily influenced by the vicinity of the gulf of genoa barometric low and the relative proximity of the atlantic ocean low pressures in autumn can generate the formation of the socalled medicanes extratropical cyclones which affect the mediterranean basin in  the island was hit by several cyclones included the cyclone cleopatra which dumped almost  inches  mm of rainfall within an hour and a half sardinia being relatively large and hilly weather is not uniform in particular the east is drier but paradoxically it suffers the worst rainstorms  in autumn  it rained more than  mm  in in a single day in siniscola and  november  locations in sardinia were reported to have received more than  mm  inches within two hours the western coast has a higher distribution of rainfalls even for modest elevations for instance iglesias elevation  m  ft average annual precipitation  mm  in the driest part of the island is the coast of cagliari gulf with less than  mm  in per year the minimum is at capo carbonara at the extreme southeast of the island  mm  in and the wettest is the top of the gennargentu mountain with almost  mm  in per year the average for the entire island is about  mm  in per year which is more than enough for the needs of the population and vegetation the mistral from the northwest is the dominant wind on and off throughout the year though it is most prevalent in winter and spring it can blow quite strongly but it is usually dry and cool climate data for cagliari altitude  m month jan feb mar apr may jun

history of sardinia see also history of mining in sardinia prehistoryedit see also prenuragic sardinia domus de janas at villanova monteleone sardinia is one of the most geologically ancient bodies of land in europe the island was populated in various waves of immigration from prehistory until recent times the first people to settle in sardinia during the upper paleolithic and the mesolithic came probably from the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula the paleolithic colonization of the island is demonstrated by the evidences in olienas corbeddu cave in the mesolithic some populations particularly from presentday tuscany managed to move to northern sardinia via corsica the neolithic revolution was introduced in the th millennium bc by the cardial culture coming from the italian peninsula in the midneolithic period the ozieri culture probably of aegean origin flourished on the island spreading the hypogeum tombs known as domus de janas while the arzachena culture of gallura built the first megaliths circular tombs in the early rd millennium bc began to develop the metallurgy of copper and silver  during the late chalcolithic the socalled beaker culture coming from continental europe appeared in sardinia these new people predominantly settled on the west coast where the majority of the sites attributed to them had been found the beaker culture was followed in the early bronze age by the bonnanaro culture which showed both reminiscences of the beaker and influences by the polada culture as time passed the different sardinian populations appear to have become united in customs yet remained politically divided into various small tribal groupings at times banding together and at others waging war against each other habitations consisted of round thatched stone huts nuraghe losa nuragic civilizationedit main article nuragic civilization from about  bc onwards villages were built around round towerfortresses called nuraghi singular form nuraghe usually pluralized in english as nuraghes these towers were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements tribal boundaries were guarded by smaller lookout nuraghes erected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories today some  nuraghes dot the sardinian landscape while initially these nuraghes had a relatively simple structure with time they became extremely complex and monumental see for example nuraghe santu antine su nuraxi or nuraghe arrubiu the scale complexity and territorial spread of these buildings attest to the level of wealth accumulated by the nuragic people their advances in technology and the complexity of their society which was able to coordinate large numbers of people with different roles for the purpose of building the monumental nuraghes giants grave in dorgali bronze age the nuraghes are not the only nuragic buildings that survive as there are several sacred wells around sardinia and other buildings that had religious purposes such as the giants grave monumental collective tombs and collections of religious buildings that probably served as destinations for pilgrimage and mass religious rites eg su romanzesu near bitti head of one of the socalled giants of monte prama sardinia was at the time at the centre of several commercial routes and it was an important provider of raw materials such as copper and lead which were pivotal for the manufacture of the time by controlling the extraction of these raw materials and by commercing them with other countries the nuragic civilisation was able to accumulate wealth and reach a level of sophistication that is not only reflected in the complexity of its surviving buildings but also in its artworks eg the votive bronze statuettes found across sardinia according to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with the sherden a tribe of the sea peoples the nuragic civilization was linked with other contemporaneous megalithic civilization of the western mediterranean such as the talaiotic culture of the balearic islands and the torrean civilization of south corsica evidence of trade with the other civilizations of the time is attested by several artefacts eg pots coming from as far as cyprus crete mainland greece spain and italy that have been found in nuragic sites bearing witness to the scope of commercial relations between the nuragic people and other peoples in europe and beyond ancient historyedit the phoenician and subsequently roman town of tharros necropolis of tuvixeddu cagliari around the th century bc the phoenicians began visiting sardinia with increasing frequency presumably initially needing safe overnight andor allweather anchorages along their trade routes from the coast of modernday lebanon as far afield as the african and european atlantic coasts and beyond the most common ports of call were caralis nora bithia sulci and tharros claudian a thcentury latin poet in his poem de bello gildonico stated that caralis was founded by people from tyre probably in the same time of the foundation of carthage in the th or th century bc in the th century bc after the conquest of western sicily the carthaginians planned to annex sardinia a first invasion attempt led by malco was foiled by the victorious nuraghic resistance however from  bc the southern and westcentral part of the island was invaded a second time and came under carthaginian rule roman thermae of forum traiani in what is now fordongianus in  bc taking advantage of carthage having to face a rebellion of her mercenaries the mercenary war after the first punic war – bc the romans annexed corsica and sardinia from the carthaginians the two islands became the province of corsica and sardinia they were not given a provincial governor until  bc the romans faced many rebellions and it took them many years to pacify both islands the existing coastal cities were enlarged and embellished and roman colonies such as turris lybissonis and feronia were founded these were populated by roman immigrants the roman military occupation brought the nuragic civilization to an end except for the mountainous interior of the island which the romans called barbaria meaning “barbarian land” roman rule in sardinia lasted  years during which time the province was an important source of grain for the capital latin came to be the dominant spoken language during this period though roman culture was slower to take hold and roman rule was often contested by the sardinian tribes from the mountainous regions vandal conquestedit a vandalperiod coin found in sardinia depicting godas latin legend  rex cvda the east germanic tribe of the vandals conquered sardinia in  their rule lasted for  years up to  when  eastern roman troops led by cyril one of the officers of the foederati retook the island it is known that the vandal government continued the forms of the existing roman imperial structure the governor of sardinia continued to be called the praeses and apparently continued to manage military judicial and civil governmental functions via imperial procedures the only vandal governor of sardinia about whom there is substantial record is the last godas a visigoth noble in ad  a coup détat in carthage removed king hilderic a convert to nicene christianity in favor of his cousin gelimer an arian christian like most of the élite in his kingdom godas was sent to take charge and ensure the loyalty of sardinia he did the exact opposite declaring the islands independence from carthage and opening negotiations with emperor justinian i who had declared war on hilderics behalf in ad  gelimer sent the bulk of his army and navy  vessels and  men to sardinia to subdue godas with the catastrophic result that the vandal kingdom was overwhelmed when justinians own army under belisarius arrived at carthage in their absence the vandal kingdom ended and sardinia was returned to roman rule byzantine era and the rise of the giudicatiedit in  sardinia returned to the rule of the byzantine empire when the vandals were defeated by the armies of justinian i under the general belisarius in the battle of tricamarum in their african kingdom belisarius sent his general cyril to sardinia to retake the island sardinia remained in byzantine hands for the next  years aside from a short period in which it was invaded by the ostrogoths in  under byzantine rule the island was divided into districts called mereíai μερείαι in byzantine greek which were governed by a judge residing in caralis and garrisoned by an army stationed in forum traiani today fordongianus under the command of a dux during this time christianity took deeper root on the island supplanting the paganism which had survived into the early middle ages in the culturally conservative hinterlands along with lay christianity the followers of monastic figures such as basil of caesarea became established in sardinia while christianity penetrated the majority of the population the region of barbagia remained largely pagan and probably partially nonlatin speaking they reestablished a shortlived independent domain with sardinianheathen lay and religious traditions one of its kings being hospito pope gregory i wrote a letter to hospito defining him dux barbaricinorum and being christian the leader and best of his people in this unique letter about hospito the pope prompts him to convert his people who “living all like irrational animals ignore the true god and worship wood and stone” barbaricini omnes ut insensata animalia vivant deum verum nesciant ligna autem et lapides adorent santa sabina byzantine church and nuraghe in silanus the dates and circumstances of the end of byzantine rule in sardinia are not known direct central control was maintained at least through c  after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of gregory the patrician exarch of africa and the first invasion of the muslim conquest of the maghreb there is some evidence that senior byzantine administration in the exarchate of africa retreated to caralis following the final fall of carthage to the arabs in  the loss of imperial control in africa led to escalating raids by moors and berbers on the island the first of which is documented in  forcing increased military selfreliance in the province communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the muslim conquest of sicily between  and  a letter by pope nicholas i as early as  mentions the sardinian judges without reference to the empire and a letter by pope john viii reigned – refers to them as principes princes by the time of de administrando imperio completed in  the byzantine authorities no longer listed sardinia as an imperial province suggesting they considered it lost in all likelihood a local noble family acceded to the power still identifying themselves as vassals of the byzantines but de facto independent as communications with constantinople were very difficult we know only two names of those rulers salusios σαλούσιος and the protospatharios turcoturios tουρκοτούριος from two inscriptions who probably reigned between the th and the th century these rulers were still closely linked to the byzantines both for a pact of ancient vassalage and from the ideological point of view with the use of the greek language in a country of the romance language and the use of art of byzantine inspiration the medieval basilica of san gavino in porto torres th century frescoes in the basilica di saccargia in codrongianos in the early th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by muslims based in spain the only records of that war are from pisan and genoese chronicles the christians won but after that the previous sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four small giudicati cagliari calari arborea arbaree gallura torres or logudoro whether this final transformation from imperial civil servant to independent sovereign resulted from imperial abandonment or local assertion by the th century the giudici sardinian judikes  latin iudices literally judges a byzantine administrative title had emerged as the autonomous rulers of sardinia the title of iudice changed with the language and local understanding of the position becoming the sardinian judike essentially a king or sovereign while giudicato sardinian judicadu literally ‘judgeship’ or ‘judicature’ came to mean state a letter by mieszko i of poland to pope john xv proves that the giudicati were known even in poland and that they played an important role in medieval europe early medieval sardinian political institutions evolved from the millennium old roman imperial structures with relatively little germanic influence although the giudicati were hereditary lordships the old byzantine imperial notion that personal title or honor was separate from the state still remained so the giudicato was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later european feudalism like the imperial systems the new order also preserved semidemocratic forms with national assemblies called the crown of the realm each giudicato saw to its own defense maintained its own laws and administration and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs the history of the four giudicati would be defined by the contest for influence between the rival rising sea powers of genoa and pisa and later the ambitions of the kingdom of aragon sardinian giudicati the giudicato of cagliari or pluminos during the regency of torchitorio v of cagliari and his successor william iii was allied with the republic of genoa for this it was brought to an end in  when its capital santa igia was stormed and destroyed by an alliance of sardinian and pisan forces the territory then was divided between republic of pisa the della gherardesca family and the giudicati of arborea and gallura pisa maintained the control over the fortress of castel di cagliari founded by pisan merchants in  east of santa igia in the southwest the count ugolino della gherardesca promoted the birth of the town of villa di chiesa today iglesias to exploit the nearby rich silver deposits the giudicato of logudoro sometimes called torres was also allied to the republic of genoa and came to an end in  after the death of the judikessa queen adelasia the territory was divided up between the doria and malaspina families of genoa and the basserra family of arborea while the city of sassari became a small republic like the

of anjou and catalans over the possession of sicily despite the existence of the indigenous states the pope offered this newly created crown to james ii of aragon promising him support should he wish to conquer pisan sardinia in exchange for sicily the proclamation of the republic of sassari the sassarese republic lasted from  until  when it sided with the new born kingdom of sardinia in  in alliance with the kingdom of arborea and following a military campaign that lasted a year or so the aragon crown prince alfonso led a catalan army that occupied the pisan territories of cagliari and gallura along with the allied city of sassari naming them the kingdom of sardinia and corsica the kingdom was to remain a dominion of the crown of aragon under the kings of spain until the treaty of utrecht during this period the giudicato of arborea promulgated the legal code of the kingdom in the carta de logu ‘charter of the land’ the carta de logu was originally compiled by marianus iv of arborea and was amended and updated by marianos daughter female judge judikessa or juighissa eleanor of arborea the legal code was written in sardinian and established a whole range of citizens rights among the revolutionary concepts in this carta de logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property in terms of civil liberties the code made provincial th century sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of europe in  peter iv of aragon following aragonese customs granted a parliament to the kingdom of sardinia and corsica which was followed by some degree of selfgovernment under a viceroy and judicial independence this parliament however had limited powers it consisted of highranking military commanders the clergy and the nobility the kingdom of aragon also introduced the feudal system into the areas of sardinia that it ruled the sardinian giudicati never adopted feudalism and arborea maintained its parliament called the corona de logu crown of the realm in this parliament apart from the nobles and military commanders also sat the representatives of each township and village the corona de logu exercised some control over the king under the rule of the bannus consensus the king could be deposed or even executed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom statue of judichessa eleanor of arborea in oristano broken the alliance with the crown of aragon from  to  the arborean giudici marianus iv hugh iii and brancaleone doria husband of eleanor of arborea succeeded in occupying all of sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the

battle of sanluri the battle was fought by about  sardinian genoese and french knights enrolled from their kingdom at a time when the population of sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague despite the sardinian army outnumbering the aragonese army they were defeated the giudicato of arborea disappeared in  when its rights were sold by the last king for  gold florins and after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges for example leonardo cubello with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the kings of arborea was granted the title of marquis of oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the kingdom of arborea in exchange for his subjection to the aragonese monarchs the conquest of sardinia by the kingdom of aragon meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout sardinia thus sardinia is probably the only european country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the middle ages to the early modern period at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other european countries spanish periodedit flag of the kingdom of

consequence of the spanish war of succession the rule of the kingdom of sardinia passed from king philip v of spain into the hands of the austrians who occupied the island the treaty of utrecht granted sardinia to the austrians but in  cardinal giulio alberoni minister of philip v of spain reoccupied sardinia in  with the treaty of london sardinia was handed over to the house of savoy that

defeated the fleets of the french republic near the maddalena archipelago of which thenlieutenant napoleon bonaparte was a leader millelire became the first recipient of the gold medal of military valor of the italian armed forces in the same month sardinians stopped the attempted french landing on the beach of quartu santelena near the capital of cagliari because of these successes the representatives of nobility and clergy stamenti formulated five requests addressed to the king victor amadeus iii of sardinia but they got refused because of this discontent on  april  during an uprising in cagliari two savoyard officials were killed that was the start of a revolt called the sardinian vespers in the island which culminated on  april  commemorated today as sa die de sa

against feudalism mainly from the region of logudoro occupied the city on  february  in order to prevent the spread of the revolt the viceroy filippo vivalda gave the sardinian magistrate giovanni maria angioy the role of alternos which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself angioy moved from cagliari to sassari and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising demanding an end to feudalism and aiming to declare the island to be an independent republic but once he was outnumbered by loyalist forces he fled to paris and sought support for a french annexation of the island in  the islet near sardinia was attacked by the tunisians and over  inhabitants were taken away as slaves the final muslim attack on the island was on santantioco on  october  over a millennium since the first in  as a consequence of the napoleonic wars in italy the savoy royal family left turin and took refuge in cagliari for some fifteen years in  the sardinian parliaments stamenti in order to get the piedmontese liberal reforms they could not afford due to their separated legal system renounced their state autonomy and agreed to form a union with piedmont savoy nice and liguria in order to have a single parliament a single magistracy and a single government in turin this move aggravated the islands peripheral condition and most of the prounion supporters including its leader giovanni siotto pintor would later regret it sardinians wearing traditional clothing s in  the savoyards imposed the enclosures act editto delle chiudende on the island aimed at turning the lands traditional collective ownership a cultural and economic cornerstone of sardinia since the nuragic times to private property this gave rise to many abuses as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor sardinian farmers and shepherds who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land many local rebellions like the nuorese su connottu the already known in sardinian riot in  all repressed by the kings army resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land however the common lands called ademprivios were never completely abolished and they are still present in large number to this day  hectares of common lands were counted in  of which  constituted by woods in  the confederation of states powered by the savoyard kings of sardinia became a unitarian and constitutional state and moved to the italian wars of independence for the unification of italy that were led for thirteen years in  being italy united by a debated war campaign the parliament of the kingdom of sardinia decided by law to change its name and the title of its king in kingdom of italy and king of italy most sardinian forests were

gold metals sardinia lost more young people than any other italian region on the front with  casualties per  soldiers compared to the italian average of  casualties during the fascist period with the implementation of the policy of autarky several swamps around the island were reclaimed and agrarian communities founded the main communities were the village of mussolinia now called arborea populated by farmers from veneto and friuli in the area of oristano and fertilia populated at first by settlers from the ferrara area followed after world war ii by a notable number of istrian italians and dalmatian italians hailing from territories lost to yugoslavia in the area adjacent the city of alghero within the region of nurra  also established during that time  was the city of

standard orthography and controversial proposed solutions to this problem the two most widely spoken forms of the language are the southern dialects known as campidanese sardu campidanesu and the northern dialects known as logudorese sardu logudoresu extending almost to the suburbs of sassari the sardinian language is quite different from the other romance languages and is homogeneous in terms of morphology syntax and lexicon but it also shows a spectrum of variation in terms of phonetics between the northern and the southern dialects sassarese sassaresu and gallurese gadduresu are

testifies to the names existence when the phoenician merchants first arrived according to timaeus one of platos dialogues sardinia and its people as well might have been named after sardò σαρδώ a legendary woman born in sardis σάρδεις capital of the ancient kingdom of lydia there has also been speculation that identifies the ancient nuragic sards with the sherden one of the sea peoples it is suggested that the name had a religious connotation from its use also as the adjective for the ancient sardinian mythological herogod sardus pater sardinian father in modern times misunderstood as being father sardus as well as being the stem of the adjective sardonic in classical antiquity sardinia was called ichnusa the latinised form of ancient greek υκνούσσα σανδάλιον sandal sardinia and sardó σαρδώ geographyedit topographic map of sardinia the southern coast of corsica as seen from santa teresa gallura cala goloritzé baunei view of gennargentu the highest massif of sardinia a

area of  square kilometres  sq mi it is situated between °  and °  latitude north respectively isola del toro and isola la presa and °  and °  east longitude respectively capo dellargentiera and capo comino to the west of sardinia is the sea of sardinia a unit of the mediterranean sea to sardinias east is the tyrrhenian sea which is also an element of the mediterranean sea lake omodeo the largest reservoir in italy the nearest land masses are clockwise from north the island of corsica the italian peninsula sicily tunisia the balearic islands and provence the tyrrhenian sea portion of the mediterranean sea is directly to the east of sardinia between the sardinian east coast and the west coast of the italian mainland peninsula the strait of bonifacio is directly north of sardinia and separates sardinia from the french island of corsica the coasts of sardinia  kilometres  miles long are generally high and rocky with long relatively straight stretches of coastline many outstanding headlands a few wide deep bays rias many inlets and with various smaller islands off the coast the island has an ancient geoformation and unlike sicily and mainland italy is not earthquakeprone its rocks date in fact from the palaeozoic era up to  million years old due to long erosion processes the islands highlands formed of granite schist trachyte basalt called jaras or gollei sandstone and dolomite limestone called tonneri or heels average at between  to  metres  to  feet the highest peak is punta la marmora perdas carpìas in sardinian language m  ft part of the gennargentu ranges in

albo  m  ft the sette fratelli range in the southeast and the sulcis mountains and the monte linas  m  ft the islands ranges and plateaux are separated by wide alluvial valleys and flatlands the main ones being the campidano in the southwest between oristano and cagliari and the nurra in the northwest sardinia has few major rivers the largest being the tirso  km  mi long which flows into the sea of sardinia the coghinas  km and the flumendosa  km there are  artificial lakes and dams that supply water and electricity the main ones are lake omodeo and lake coghinas the only natural freshwater lake is lago di baratz a number of large shallow saltwater lagoons and pools are located along the  km  mi of the coastline climateedit sardinia average rainfalls the climate of the island is variable from area to area due to several factors including the extension in latitude and the elevation it can be classified in two different macrobioclimates mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and temperate oceanic one macrobioclimatic variant called submediterranean and four classes of continentality from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental eight thermotypic horizons from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate and seven ombrotypic horizons from lower dry to lower hyperhumid resulting in a combination of  different isobioclimates during the year there is a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn some heavy showers in the spring and snowfalls in the highlands the average temperature is between  to  °c  to  °f with mild winters and hot summers on the coasts   to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july and cold winters and cool summers on the mountains  − to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july rainfall has a mediterranean distribution all over the island with almost totally rainless summers and wet autumns winters and springs however in summer the rare rainfalls can be characterized by short but severe thunderstorms which can cause flash floods the climate is also heavily influenced by the vicinity of the gulf of genoa barometric low and the relative proximity of the atlantic ocean low pressures in autumn can generate the formation of the socalled medicanes extratropical cyclones which affect the mediterranean basin in  the island was hit by several cyclones included the cyclone cleopatra which dumped almost  inches  mm of rainfall within an hour and a half sardinia being relatively large and hilly weather is not uniform in particular the east is drier but paradoxically it suffers the worst rainstorms  in autumn  it rained more than  mm  in in a single day in siniscola and  november  locations in sardinia were reported to have received more than  mm  inches within two hours the western coast has a higher distribution of rainfalls even for modest elevations for instance iglesias elevation  m  ft average annual precipitation  mm  in the driest part of the island is the coast of cagliari gulf with less than  mm  in per year the minimum is at capo carbonara at the extreme southeast of the island  mm  in and the wettest is the top of the gennargentu mountain with almost  mm  in per year the average for the entire island is about  mm  in per year which is more than enough for the needs of the population and vegetation the mistral from the northwest is the dominant wind on and

history of sardinia see also history of mining in sardinia prehistoryedit see also prenuragic sardinia domus de janas at villanova monteleone sardinia is one of the most geologically ancient bodies of land in europe the island was populated in various waves of immigration from prehistory until recent times the first people to settle in sardinia during the upper paleolithic and the mesolithic came probably from the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula the paleolithic colonization of the island is demonstrated by the evidences in olienas corbeddu cave in the mesolithic some populations particularly from presentday tuscany managed to move to northern sardinia via corsica the neolithic revolution was introduced in the th millennium bc by the cardial culture coming from the italian peninsula in the midneolithic period the ozieri culture probably of aegean origin flourished on the island spreading the hypogeum tombs known as domus de janas while the arzachena culture of gallura built the first megaliths circular tombs in the early rd millennium bc began to develop the metallurgy of copper and silver  during the late chalcolithic the socalled beaker culture coming from continental europe appeared in sardinia these new people predominantly settled on the west coast where the majority of the sites attributed to them had been found the beaker culture was followed in the early bronze age by the bonnanaro culture which showed both reminiscences of the beaker and influences by the polada culture as time passed the different sardinian populations appear to have become united in customs yet remained politically divided into various small tribal groupings at times banding together and at others waging war against each other habitations consisted of round thatched stone huts nuraghe losa nuragic civilizationedit main article nuragic civilization from about  bc onwards villages were built around round towerfortresses called nuraghi singular form nuraghe usually pluralized in english as nuraghes these towers were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements tribal boundaries were guarded by smaller lookout nuraghes erected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories today some  nuraghes dot the sardinian landscape while initially these nuraghes had a relatively simple structure with time they became extremely complex and monumental see for example nuraghe santu antine su nuraxi or nuraghe arrubiu the scale complexity and territorial spread of these buildings attest to the level of wealth accumulated by the nuragic people their advances in technology and the complexity of their society which was able to coordinate large numbers of people with different roles for the purpose of building the monumental nuraghes giants grave in dorgali bronze age the nuraghes are not the only nuragic buildings that survive as there are several sacred wells around sardinia and other buildings that had religious purposes such as the giants grave monumental collective tombs and collections of religious buildings that probably served as destinations for pilgrimage and mass religious rites eg su romanzesu near bitti head of one of the socalled giants of monte prama sardinia was at the time at the centre of several commercial routes and it was an important provider of raw materials such as copper and lead which were pivotal for the manufacture of the time by controlling the extraction of these raw materials and by commercing them with other countries the nuragic civilisation was able to accumulate wealth and reach a level of sophistication that is not only reflected in the complexity of its surviving buildings but also in its artworks eg the votive bronze statuettes found across sardinia according to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with the sherden a tribe of the sea peoples the nuragic civilization was linked with other contemporaneous megalithic civilization of the western mediterranean such as the talaiotic culture of the balearic islands and the torrean civilization of south corsica evidence of trade with the other civilizations of the time is attested by several artefacts eg pots coming from as far as cyprus crete mainland greece spain and italy that have been found in nuragic sites bearing witness to the scope of commercial relations between the nuragic people and other peoples in europe and beyond ancient historyedit the phoenician and subsequently roman town of tharros necropolis of tuvixeddu cagliari around the th century bc the phoenicians began visiting sardinia with increasing frequency presumably initially needing safe overnight andor allweather anchorages along their trade routes from the coast of modernday lebanon as far afield as the african and european atlantic coasts and beyond the most common ports of call were caralis nora bithia sulci and tharros claudian a thcentury latin poet in his poem de bello gildonico stated that caralis was founded by people from tyre probably in the same time of the foundation of carthage in the th or th century bc in the th century bc after the conquest of western sicily the carthaginians planned to annex sardinia a first invasion attempt led by malco was foiled by the victorious nuraghic resistance however from  bc the southern and westcentral part of the island was invaded a second time and came under carthaginian rule roman thermae of forum traiani in what is now fordongianus in  bc taking advantage of carthage having to face a rebellion of her mercenaries the mercenary war after the first punic war – bc the romans annexed corsica and sardinia from the carthaginians the two islands became the province of corsica and sardinia they were not given a provincial governor until  bc the romans faced many rebellions and it took them many years to pacify both islands the existing coastal cities were enlarged and embellished and roman colonies such as turris lybissonis and feronia were founded these were populated by roman immigrants the roman military occupation brought the nuragic civilization to an end except for the mountainous interior of the island which the romans called barbaria meaning “barbarian land” roman rule in sardinia lasted  years during which time the province was an important source of grain for the capital latin came to be the dominant spoken language during this period though roman culture was slower to take hold and roman rule was often contested by the sardinian tribes from the mountainous regions vandal conquestedit a vandalperiod coin found in sardinia depicting godas latin legend  rex cvda the east germanic tribe of the vandals conquered sardinia in  their rule lasted for  years up to  when  eastern roman troops led by cyril one of the officers of the foederati retook the island it is known that the vandal government continued the forms of the existing roman imperial structure the governor of sardinia continued to be called the praeses and apparently continued to manage military judicial and civil governmental functions via imperial procedures the only vandal governor of sardinia about whom there is substantial record is the last godas a visigoth noble in ad  a coup détat in carthage removed king hilderic a convert to nicene christianity in favor of his cousin gelimer an arian christian like most of the élite in his kingdom godas was sent to take charge and ensure the loyalty of sardinia he did the exact opposite declaring the islands independence from carthage and opening negotiations with emperor justinian i who had declared war on hilderics behalf in ad  gelimer sent the bulk of his army and navy  vessels and  men to sardinia to subdue godas with the catastrophic result that the vandal kingdom was overwhelmed when justinians own army under belisarius arrived at carthage in their absence the vandal kingdom ended and sardinia was returned to roman rule byzantine era and the rise of the giudicatiedit in  sardinia returned to the rule of the byzantine empire when the vandals were defeated by the armies of justinian i under the general belisarius in the battle of tricamarum in their african kingdom belisarius sent his general cyril to sardinia to retake the island sardinia remained in byzantine hands for the next  years aside from a short period in which it was invaded by the ostrogoths in  under byzantine rule the island was divided into districts called mereíai μερείαι in byzantine greek which were governed by a judge residing in caralis and garrisoned by an army stationed in forum traiani today fordongianus under the command of a dux during this time christianity took deeper root on the island supplanting the paganism which had survived into the early middle ages in the culturally conservative hinterlands along with lay christianity the followers of monastic figures such as basil of caesarea became established in sardinia while christianity penetrated the majority of the population the region of barbagia remained largely pagan and probably partially nonlatin speaking they reestablished a shortlived independent domain with sardinianheathen lay and religious traditions one of its kings being hospito pope gregory i wrote a letter to hospito defining him dux barbaricinorum and being christian the leader and best of his people in this unique letter about hospito the pope prompts him to convert his people who “living all like irrational animals ignore the true god and worship wood and stone” barbaricini omnes ut insensata animalia vivant deum verum nesciant ligna autem et lapides adorent santa sabina byzantine church and nuraghe in silanus the dates and circumstances of the end of byzantine rule in sardinia are not known direct central control was maintained at least through c  after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of gregory the patrician exarch of africa and the first invasion of the muslim conquest of the maghreb there is some evidence that senior byzantine administration in the exarchate of africa retreated to caralis following the final fall of carthage to the arabs in  the loss of imperial control in africa led to escalating raids by moors and berbers on the island the first of which is documented in  forcing increased military selfreliance in the province communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the muslim conquest of sicily between  and  a letter by pope nicholas i as early as  mentions the sardinian judges without reference to the empire and a letter by pope john viii reigned – refers to them as principes princes by the time of de administrando imperio completed in  the byzantine authorities no longer listed sardinia as an imperial province suggesting they considered it lost in all likelihood a local noble family acceded to the power still identifying themselves as vassals of the byzantines but de facto independent as communications with constantinople were very difficult we know only two names of those rulers salusios σαλούσιος and the protospatharios turcoturios tουρκοτούριος from two inscriptions who probably reigned between the th and the th century these rulers were still closely linked to the byzantines both for a pact of ancient vassalage and from the ideological point of view with the use of the greek language in a country of the romance language and the use of art of byzantine inspiration the medieval basilica of san gavino in porto torres th century frescoes in the basilica di saccargia in codrongianos in the early th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by muslims based in spain the only records of that war are from pisan and genoese chronicles the christians won but after that the previous sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four small giudicati cagliari calari arborea arbaree gallura torres or logudoro whether this final transformation from imperial civil servant to independent sovereign resulted from imperial abandonment or local assertion by the th century the giudici sardinian judikes  latin iudices literally judges a byzantine administrative title had emerged as the autonomous rulers of sardinia the title of iudice changed with the language and local understanding of the position becoming the sardinian judike essentially a king or sovereign while giudicato sardinian judicadu literally ‘judgeship’ or ‘judicature’ came to mean state a letter by mieszko i of poland to pope john xv proves that the giudicati were known even in poland and that they played an important role in medieval europe early medieval sardinian political institutions evolved from the millennium old roman imperial structures with relatively little germanic influence although the giudicati were hereditary lordships the old byzantine imperial notion that personal title or honor was separate from the state still remained so the giudicato was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later european feudalism like the imperial systems the new order also preserved semidemocratic forms with national assemblies called the crown of the realm each giudicato saw to its own defense maintained its own laws and administration and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs the history of the four giudicati would be defined by the contest for influence between the rival rising sea powers of genoa and pisa and later the ambitions of the kingdom of aragon sardinian giudicati the giudicato of cagliari or pluminos during the regency of torchitorio v of cagliari and his successor william iii was allied with the republic of genoa for this it was brought to an end in  when its capital santa igia was stormed and destroyed by an alliance of sardinian and pisan forces the territory then was divided between republic of pisa the della gherardesca family and the giudicati of arborea and gallura pisa maintained the control over the fortress of castel di cagliari founded by pisan merchants in  east of santa igia in the southwest the count ugolino della gherardesca promoted the birth of the town of villa di chiesa today iglesias to exploit the nearby rich silver deposits the giudicato of logudoro sometimes called torres was also allied to the republic of genoa and came to an end in  after the death of the judikessa queen adelasia the territory was divided up between the doria and malaspina families of genoa and the basserra family of arborea while the city of sassari became a small republic like the italian citystates comuni confederated firstly with pisa and then with genoa the giudicato of gallura ended in the year  when the last giudice nino visconti a friend of dante alighieri was driven out by the pisans who occupied the territory the giudicato of arborea having oristano as its capital had a longer life compared to the other kingdoms its later history is entwined with the attempt to unify the island into a single sardinian state republica sardisca against their relatives and former aragonese allies aragonese periodedit in  pope boniface viii established on his own initiative motu proprio a hypothetical regnum sardiniae et corsicae kingdom of sardinia and corsica in order to settle the war of the sicilian vespers diplomatically this had broken out in  between the capetian house of anjou and catalans over the possession of sicily despite the existence of the indigenous states the pope offered this newly created crown to james ii of aragon promising him support should he wish to conquer pisan sardinia in exchange for sicily the proclamation of the republic of sassari the sassarese republic lasted from  until  when it sided with the new born kingdom of sardinia in  in alliance with the kingdom of arborea and following a military campaign that lasted a year or so the aragon crown prince alfonso led a catalan army that occupied the pisan territories of cagliari and gallura along with the allied city of sassari naming them the kingdom of sardinia and corsica the kingdom was to remain a dominion of the crown of aragon under the kings of spain until the treaty of utrecht during this period the giudicato of arborea promulgated the legal code of the kingdom in the carta de logu ‘charter of the land’ the carta de logu was originally compiled by marianus iv of arborea and was amended and updated by marianos daughter female judge judikessa or juighissa eleanor of arborea the legal code was written in sardinian and established a whole range of citizens rights among the revolutionary concepts in this carta de logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property in terms of civil liberties the code made provincial th century sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of europe in  peter iv of aragon following aragonese customs granted a parliament to the kingdom of sardinia and corsica which was followed by some degree of selfgovernment under a viceroy and judicial independence this parliament however had limited powers it consisted of highranking military commanders the clergy and the nobility the kingdom of aragon also introduced the feudal system into the areas of sardinia that it ruled the sardinian giudicati never adopted feudalism and arborea maintained its parliament called the corona de logu crown of the realm in this parliament apart from the nobles and military commanders also sat the representatives of each township and village the corona de logu exercised some control over the king under the rule of the bannus consensus the king could be deposed or even executed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom statue of judichessa eleanor of arborea in oristano broken the alliance with the crown of aragon from  to  the arborean giudici marianus iv hugh iii and brancaleone doria husband of eleanor of arborea succeeded in occupying all of sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the castle of cagliari and alghero which for years remained as the only aragonese dominions in sardinia in  martin i of sicily king of sicily and heir to the crown of aragon defeated the sardinians at the battle of sanluri the battle was fought by about  sardinian genoese and french knights enrolled from their kingdom at a time when the population of sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague despite the sardinian army outnumbering the aragonese army they were defeated the giudicato of arborea disappeared in  when its rights were sold by the last king for  gold florins and after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges for example leonardo cubello with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the kings of arborea was granted the title of marquis of oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the kingdom of arborea in exchange for his subjection to the aragonese monarchs the conquest of sardinia by the kingdom of aragon meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout sardinia thus sardinia is probably the only european country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the middle ages to the early modern period at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other european countries spanish periodedit flag of the kingdom of sardinia center at the funeral of charles i of spain in  the heir to sardinia ferdinand ii of aragon married isabel of castile and the kingdom of sardinia which was separated from corsica was to be

collective ownership a cultural and economic cornerstone of sardinia since the nuragic times to private property this gave rise to many abuses as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor sardinian farmers and shepherds who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land many local rebellions like the nuorese su connottu the already known in sardinian riot in  all repressed by the kings army resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land however the common lands called ademprivios were never

been influenced by catalan spanish and recently italian while the once spoken nuragic contributes many features to it in many ancient remnants in  the regional administration has approved the use of a standardised writing system the socalled limba sarda comuna in official acts as a literary language sardinian is gaining importance despite heated debate about the lack of a commonly acknowledged standard orthography and controversial proposed solutions to this problem the two most widely spoken forms of the language are the southern dialects known as campidanese sardu campidanesu and the northern dialects known as logudorese sardu logudoresu extending almost to the suburbs of sassari the sardinian language is quite different from the other romance languages and is homogeneous in terms of morphology syntax and lexicon but it also shows a spectrum of variation in terms of phonetics between the northern and the southern dialects sassarese sassaresu and gallurese gadduresu are

testifies to the names existence when the phoenician merchants first arrived according to timaeus one of platos dialogues sardinia and its people as well might have been named after sardò σαρδώ a legendary woman born in sardis σάρδεις capital of the ancient kingdom of lydia there has also been speculation that identifies the ancient nuragic sards with the sherden one of the sea peoples it is suggested that the name had a religious connotation from its use also as the adjective for the ancient sardinian mythological herogod sardus pater sardinian father in modern times misunderstood as being father sardus as well as being the stem of the adjective sardonic in classical antiquity sardinia was called ichnusa the latinised form of ancient greek υκνούσσα σανδάλιον sandal sardinia and

mediterranean sea is directly to the east of sardinia between the sardinian east coast and the west coast of the italian mainland peninsula the strait of bonifacio is directly north of sardinia and separates sardinia from the french island of corsica the coasts of sardinia  kilometres  miles long are generally high and rocky with long relatively straight stretches of coastline many outstanding headlands a few wide deep bays rias many inlets and with various smaller islands off the coast the island has an ancient geoformation and unlike sicily and mainland italy is not earthquakeprone its rocks date in fact from the palaeozoic era up to  million years old due to long erosion processes the islands highlands formed of granite schist trachyte basalt called jaras or gollei sandstone and

lake is lago di baratz a number of large shallow saltwater lagoons and pools are located along the  km  mi of the coastline climateedit sardinia average rainfalls the climate of the island is variable from area to area due to several factors including the extension in latitude and the elevation it can be classified in two different macrobioclimates mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and temperate oceanic one macrobioclimatic variant called submediterranean and four classes of continentality from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental eight thermotypic horizons from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate and seven ombrotypic horizons from lower dry to lower hyperhumid resulting in a combination of  different isobioclimates during the year there is a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn some heavy showers in the spring and snowfalls in the highlands the average temperature is between  to  °c  to  °f with mild winters and hot summers on the coasts   to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july and cold winters and cool summers on the mountains  − to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july rainfall has a mediterranean distribution all over the island with almost totally rainless summers and wet autumns winters and springs however in summer the rare rainfalls can be characterized by short but severe thunderstorms which can cause flash floods the climate is also heavily influenced by the vicinity of the gulf of genoa barometric low and the relative proximity of the atlantic ocean low pressures in autumn can generate the formation of the socalled medicanes extratropical cyclones which affect the mediterranean basin in  the island was hit by several cyclones included the cyclone cleopatra which dumped almost  inches  mm of rainfall within an hour and a half sardinia being relatively large and hilly weather is not uniform in particular the east is drier but paradoxically it suffers the worst rainstorms  in autumn  it rained more than  mm  in in a single day in siniscola and  november  locations in sardinia were reported to have received more than  mm  inches within two hours the western coast has a higher distribution of rainfalls even for modest elevations for instance iglesias elevation  m  ft average annual precipitation  mm  in the driest part of the island is the coast of cagliari gulf with less than  mm  in per year the minimum is at capo carbonara at the extreme southeast of the island  mm  in and the wettest is the top of the gennargentu mountain with almost  mm  in per year the average for the entire island is about  mm  in per year which is more than enough for the needs of the population and vegetation the mistral from the northwest is the dominant wind on and

history of sardinia see also history of mining in sardinia prehistoryedit see also prenuragic sardinia domus de janas at villanova monteleone sardinia is one of the most geologically ancient bodies of land in europe the island was populated in various waves of immigration from prehistory until recent times the first people to settle in sardinia during the upper paleolithic and the mesolithic came probably from the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula the paleolithic colonization of the island is demonstrated by the evidences in olienas corbeddu cave in the mesolithic some populations particularly from presentday tuscany managed to move to northern sardinia via corsica the neolithic revolution was introduced in the th millennium bc by the cardial culture coming from the italian peninsula in the midneolithic period the ozieri culture probably of aegean origin flourished on the island spreading the hypogeum tombs known as domus de janas while the arzachena culture of gallura built the first megaliths circular tombs in the early rd millennium bc began to develop the metallurgy of copper and silver  during the late chalcolithic the socalled beaker culture coming from continental europe appeared in sardinia these new people predominantly settled on the west coast where the majority of the sites attributed to them had been found the beaker culture was followed in the early bronze age by the bonnanaro culture which showed both reminiscences of the beaker and influences by the polada culture as time passed the different sardinian populations appear to have become united in customs yet remained politically divided into various small tribal groupings at times banding together and at others waging war against each other habitations consisted of round thatched stone huts nuraghe losa nuragic civilizationedit main article nuragic civilization from about  bc onwards villages were built around round towerfortresses called nuraghi singular form nuraghe usually pluralized in english as nuraghes these towers were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements tribal boundaries were guarded by smaller lookout nuraghes erected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories today some  nuraghes dot the sardinian landscape while initially these nuraghes had a relatively simple structure with time they became extremely complex and monumental see for example nuraghe santu antine su nuraxi or nuraghe arrubiu the scale complexity and territorial spread of these buildings attest to the level of wealth accumulated by the nuragic people their advances in technology and the complexity of their society which was able to coordinate large numbers of people with different roles for the purpose of building the monumental nuraghes giants grave in dorgali bronze age the nuraghes are not the only nuragic buildings that survive as there are several sacred wells around sardinia and other buildings that had religious purposes such as the giants grave monumental collective tombs and collections of religious buildings that probably served as destinations for pilgrimage and mass religious rites eg su romanzesu near bitti head of one of the socalled giants of monte prama sardinia was at the time at the centre of several commercial routes and it was an important provider of raw materials such as copper and lead which were pivotal for the manufacture of the time by controlling the extraction of these raw materials and by commercing them with other countries the nuragic civilisation was able to accumulate wealth and reach a level of sophistication that is not only reflected in the complexity of its surviving buildings but also in its artworks eg the votive bronze statuettes found across sardinia according to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with the sherden a tribe of the sea peoples the nuragic civilization was linked with other contemporaneous megalithic civilization of the western mediterranean such as the talaiotic culture of the balearic islands and the torrean civilization of south corsica evidence of trade with the other civilizations of the time is attested by several artefacts eg pots coming from as far as cyprus crete mainland greece spain and italy that have been found in nuragic sites bearing witness to the scope of commercial relations between the nuragic people and other peoples in europe and beyond ancient historyedit the phoenician and subsequently roman town of tharros necropolis of tuvixeddu cagliari around the th century bc the phoenicians began visiting sardinia with increasing frequency presumably initially needing safe overnight andor allweather anchorages along their trade routes from the coast of modernday lebanon as far afield as the african and european atlantic coasts and beyond the most common ports of call were caralis nora bithia sulci and tharros claudian a thcentury latin poet in his poem de bello gildonico stated that caralis was founded by people from tyre probably in the same time of the foundation of carthage in the th or th century bc in the th century bc after the conquest of western sicily the carthaginians planned to annex sardinia a first invasion attempt led by malco was foiled by the victorious nuraghic resistance however from  bc the southern and westcentral part of the island was invaded a second time and came under carthaginian rule roman thermae of forum traiani in what is now fordongianus in  bc taking advantage of carthage having to face a rebellion of her mercenaries the mercenary war after the first punic war – bc the romans annexed corsica and sardinia from the carthaginians the two islands became the province of corsica and sardinia they were not given a provincial governor until  bc the romans faced many rebellions and it took them many years to pacify both islands the existing coastal cities were enlarged and embellished and roman colonies such as turris lybissonis and feronia were founded these were populated by roman immigrants the roman military occupation brought the nuragic civilization to an end except for the mountainous interior of the island which the romans called barbaria meaning “barbarian land” roman rule in sardinia lasted  years during which time the province was an important source of grain for the capital latin came to be the dominant spoken language during this period though roman culture was slower to take hold and roman rule was often contested by the sardinian tribes from the mountainous regions vandal conquestedit a vandalperiod coin found in sardinia depicting godas latin legend  rex cvda the east germanic tribe of the vandals conquered sardinia in  their rule lasted for  years up to  when  eastern roman troops led by cyril one of the officers of the foederati retook the island it is known that the vandal government continued the forms of the existing roman imperial structure the governor of sardinia continued to be called the praeses and apparently continued to manage military judicial and civil governmental functions via imperial procedures the only vandal governor of sardinia about whom there is substantial record is the last godas a visigoth noble in ad  a coup détat in carthage removed king hilderic a convert to nicene christianity in favor of his cousin gelimer an arian christian like most of the élite in his kingdom godas was sent to take charge and ensure the loyalty of sardinia he did the exact opposite declaring the islands independence from carthage and opening negotiations with emperor justinian i who had declared war on hilderics behalf in ad  gelimer sent the bulk of his army and navy  vessels and  men to sardinia to subdue godas with the catastrophic result that the vandal kingdom was overwhelmed when justinians own army under belisarius arrived at carthage in their absence the vandal kingdom ended and sardinia was returned to roman rule byzantine era and the rise of the giudicatiedit in  sardinia returned to the rule of the byzantine empire when the vandals were defeated by the armies of justinian i under the general belisarius in the battle of tricamarum in their african kingdom belisarius sent his general cyril to sardinia to retake the island sardinia remained in byzantine hands for the next  years aside from a short period in which it was invaded by the ostrogoths in  under byzantine rule the island was divided into districts called mereíai μερείαι in byzantine greek which were governed by a judge residing in caralis and garrisoned by an army stationed in forum traiani today fordongianus under the command of a dux during this time christianity took deeper root on the island supplanting the paganism which had survived into the early middle ages in the culturally conservative hinterlands along with lay christianity the followers of monastic figures such as basil of caesarea became established in sardinia while christianity penetrated the majority of the population the region of barbagia remained largely pagan and probably partially nonlatin speaking they reestablished a shortlived independent domain with sardinianheathen lay and religious traditions one of its kings being hospito pope gregory i wrote a letter to hospito defining him dux barbaricinorum and being christian the leader and best of his people in this unique letter about hospito the pope prompts him to convert his people who “living all like irrational animals ignore the true god and worship wood and stone” barbaricini omnes ut insensata animalia vivant deum verum nesciant ligna autem et lapides adorent santa sabina byzantine church and nuraghe in silanus the dates and circumstances of the end of byzantine rule in sardinia are not known direct central control was maintained at least through c  after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of gregory the patrician exarch of africa and the first invasion of the muslim conquest of the maghreb there is some evidence that senior byzantine administration in the exarchate of africa retreated to caralis following the final fall of carthage to the arabs in  the loss of imperial control in africa led to escalating raids by moors and berbers on the island the first of which is documented in  forcing increased military selfreliance in the province communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the muslim conquest of sicily between  and  a letter by pope nicholas i as early as  mentions the sardinian judges without reference to the empire and a letter by pope john viii reigned – refers to them as principes princes by the time of de administrando imperio completed in  the byzantine authorities no longer listed sardinia as an imperial province suggesting they considered it lost in all likelihood a local noble family acceded to the power still identifying themselves as vassals of the byzantines but de facto independent as communications with constantinople were very difficult we know only two names of those rulers salusios σαλούσιος and the protospatharios turcoturios tουρκοτούριος from two inscriptions who probably reigned between the th and the th century these rulers were still closely linked to the byzantines both for a pact of ancient vassalage and from the ideological point of view with the use of the greek language in a country of the romance language and the use of art of byzantine inspiration the medieval basilica of san gavino in porto torres th century frescoes in the basilica di saccargia in codrongianos in the early th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by muslims based in spain the only records of that war are from pisan and genoese chronicles the christians won but after that the previous sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four small giudicati cagliari calari arborea arbaree gallura torres or logudoro whether this final transformation from imperial civil servant to independent sovereign resulted from imperial abandonment or local assertion by the th century the giudici sardinian judikes  latin iudices literally judges a byzantine administrative title had emerged as the autonomous rulers of sardinia the title of iudice changed with the language and local understanding of the position becoming the sardinian judike essentially a king or sovereign while giudicato sardinian judicadu literally ‘judgeship’ or ‘judicature’ came to mean state a letter by mieszko i of poland to pope john xv proves that the giudicati were known even in poland and that they played an important role in medieval europe early medieval sardinian political institutions evolved from the millennium old roman imperial structures with relatively little germanic influence although the giudicati were hereditary lordships the old byzantine imperial notion that personal title or honor was separate from the state still remained so the giudicato was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later european feudalism like the imperial systems the new order also preserved semidemocratic forms with national assemblies called the crown of the realm each giudicato saw to its own defense maintained its own laws and administration and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs the history of the four giudicati would be defined by the contest for influence between the rival rising sea powers of genoa and pisa and later the ambitions of the kingdom of aragon sardinian giudicati the giudicato of cagliari or pluminos during the regency of torchitorio v of cagliari and his successor william iii was allied with the republic of genoa for this it was brought to an end in  when its capital santa igia was stormed and destroyed by an alliance of sardinian and pisan forces the territory then was divided between republic of pisa the della gherardesca family and the giudicati of arborea and gallura pisa maintained the control over the fortress of castel di cagliari founded by pisan merchants in  east of santa igia in the southwest the count ugolino della gherardesca promoted the birth of the town of villa di chiesa today iglesias to exploit the nearby rich silver deposits the giudicato of logudoro sometimes called torres was also allied to the republic of genoa and came to an end in  after the death of the judikessa queen adelasia the territory was divided up between the doria and malaspina families of genoa and the basserra family of arborea while the city of sassari became a small republic like the italian citystates comuni confederated firstly with pisa and then with genoa the giudicato of gallura ended in the year  when the last giudice nino visconti a friend of dante alighieri was driven out by the pisans who occupied the territory the giudicato of arborea having oristano as its capital had a longer life compared to the other kingdoms its later history is entwined with the attempt to unify the island into a single sardinian state republica sardisca against their relatives and former aragonese allies aragonese periodedit in  pope boniface viii established on his own initiative motu proprio a hypothetical regnum sardiniae et corsicae kingdom of sardinia and corsica in order to settle the war of the sicilian vespers diplomatically this had broken out in  between the capetian house of anjou and catalans over the possession of sicily despite the existence of the indigenous states the pope offered this newly created crown to james ii of aragon promising him support should he wish to conquer pisan sardinia in exchange for sicily the proclamation of the republic of sassari the sassarese republic lasted from  until  when it sided with the new born kingdom of sardinia in  in alliance with the kingdom of arborea and following a military campaign that lasted a year or so the aragon crown prince alfonso led a catalan army that occupied the pisan territories of cagliari and gallura along with the allied city of sassari naming them the kingdom of sardinia and corsica the kingdom was to remain a dominion of the crown of aragon under the kings of spain until the treaty of utrecht during this period the giudicato of arborea promulgated the legal code of the kingdom in the carta de logu ‘charter of the land’ the carta de logu was originally compiled by marianus iv of arborea and was amended and updated by marianos daughter female judge judikessa or juighissa eleanor of arborea the legal code was written in sardinian and established a whole range of citizens rights among the revolutionary concepts in this carta de logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property in terms of civil liberties the code made provincial th century sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of europe in  peter iv of aragon following aragonese customs granted a parliament to the kingdom of sardinia and corsica which was followed by some degree of selfgovernment under a viceroy and judicial independence this parliament however had limited powers it consisted of highranking military commanders the clergy and the nobility the kingdom of aragon also introduced the feudal system into the areas of sardinia that it ruled the sardinian giudicati never adopted feudalism and arborea maintained its parliament called the corona de logu crown of the realm in this parliament apart from the nobles and military commanders also sat the representatives of each township and village the corona de logu exercised some control over the king under the rule of the bannus consensus the king could be deposed or even executed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom statue of judichessa eleanor of arborea in oristano broken the alliance with the crown of aragon from  to  the arborean giudici marianus iv hugh iii and brancaleone doria husband of eleanor of arborea succeeded in occupying all of sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the castle of cagliari and alghero which for years remained as the only aragonese dominions in sardinia in  martin i of sicily king of sicily and heir to the crown of aragon defeated the sardinians at the battle of sanluri the battle was fought by about  sardinian genoese and french knights enrolled from their kingdom at a time when the population of sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague despite the sardinian army outnumbering the aragonese army they were defeated the giudicato of arborea disappeared in  when its rights were sold by the last king for  gold florins and after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges for example leonardo cubello with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the kings of arborea was granted the title of marquis of oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the kingdom of arborea in exchange for his subjection to the aragonese monarchs the conquest of sardinia by the kingdom of aragon meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout sardinia thus sardinia is probably the only european country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the middle ages to the early modern period at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other european countries spanish periodedit flag of the kingdom of sardinia center at the funeral of charles i of spain in  the heir to sardinia ferdinand ii of aragon married isabel of castile and the kingdom of sardinia which was separated from corsica was to be inherited by their habsburg grandson charles i of spain with the state symbol of the four moors the successors of charles i of spain in order to defend their mediterranean territories from raids of the barbary pirates fortified the sardinian shores with a system of coastal lookout towers allowing the gradual resettlement of some coastal areas the kingdom of sardinia remained aragonesespanish for about  years from  to  assimilating a number of spanish traditions customs and linguistic expressions nowadays vividly portrayed in the folklore parades of saint efisio in cagliari  may the cavalcade on sassari last but one sunday in may and the redeemer in nuoro  august to this day catalan is still spoken in the northwestern city of alghero lalguer many famines have been reported in sardinia according to stephen l dyson and robert j rowland the jesuits of cagliari recorded years during the late th century of such hunger and so sterile that the majority of the people could sustain life only with wild ferns and other weeds  during the terrible famine of  some  people out of a total population of  are said to have died and entire villages were devastated savoyard periodedit in  as a consequence of the spanish war of succession the rule of the kingdom of sardinia passed from king philip v of spain into the hands of the austrians who occupied the island the treaty of utrecht granted sardinia to the austrians but in  cardinal giulio alberoni minister of philip v of spain reoccupied sardinia in  with the treaty of london sardinia was handed over to the house of savoy that would impose the italian language on the island in  the french siege of cagliari and quartu in  sardinians repelled two french invasions on  february  domenico millelire commanding the sardinian fleet defeated the fleets of the french republic near the maddalena archipelago of which thenlieutenant napoleon bonaparte was a leader millelire became the first recipient of the gold medal of military valor of the italian armed forces in the same month sardinians stopped the attempted french landing on the beach of quartu santelena near the capital of cagliari because of these successes the representatives of nobility and clergy stamenti formulated five requests addressed to the king victor amadeus iii of sardinia but they got refused because of this discontent on  april  during an uprising in cagliari two savoyard officials were killed that was the start of a revolt called the sardinian vespers in the island which culminated on  april  commemorated today as sa die de sa sardigna with the expulsion or even execution of the piedmontese officers for a few days from the capital cagliari gm angioy entry into sassari on  december  in sassari insurgents demonstrating against feudalism mainly from the region of logudoro occupied the city on  february  in order to prevent the spread of the revolt the viceroy filippo vivalda gave the sardinian magistrate giovanni maria angioy the role of alternos which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself angioy moved from cagliari to sassari and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising demanding an end to feudalism and aiming to declare the island to be an independent republic but once he was outnumbered by loyalist forces he fled to paris and sought support for a french annexation of the island in  the islet near sardinia was attacked by the tunisians and over  inhabitants were taken away as slaves the final muslim attack on the island was on santantioco on  october  over a millennium since the first in  as a consequence of the napoleonic wars in italy the savoy royal family left turin and took refuge in cagliari for some fifteen years in  the sardinian parliaments stamenti in order to get the piedmontese liberal reforms they could not afford due to their separated legal system renounced their state autonomy and agreed to form a union with piedmont savoy nice and liguria in order to have a single parliament a single magistracy and a single government in turin this move aggravated the islands peripheral condition and most of the prounion supporters including its leader giovanni siotto pintor would later regret it sardinians wearing traditional clothing s in  the savoyards imposed the enclosures act editto delle chiudende on the island aimed at turning the lands traditional collective ownership a cultural and economic cornerstone of sardinia since the nuragic times to private property this gave rise to many abuses as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor sardinian farmers and shepherds who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land many local rebellions like the nuorese su connottu the already known in sardinian riot in  all repressed by the kings army resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land however the common lands called ademprivios were never completely abolished and they are still present in large number to this day  hectares of common lands were counted in  of which  constituted by woods in  the confederation of states powered by the

standardised writing system the socalled limba sarda comuna in official acts as a literary language sardinian is gaining importance despite heated debate about the lack of a commonly acknowledged standard orthography and controversial proposed solutions to this problem the two most widely spoken forms of the language are the southern dialects known as campidanese sardu campidanesu and the northern dialects known as logudorese sardu logudoresu extending almost to the suburbs of sassari the sardinian language is quite different from the other romance languages and is homogeneous in terms of morphology syntax and lexicon but it also shows a spectrum of variation in terms of phonetics between the northern and the southern dialects sassarese sassaresu and gallurese gadduresu are

headlands a few wide deep bays rias many inlets and with various smaller islands off the coast the island has an ancient geoformation and unlike sicily and mainland italy is not earthquakeprone its

from area to area due to several factors including the extension in latitude and the elevation it can be classified in two different macrobioclimates mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and temperate oceanic one macrobioclimatic variant called submediterranean and four classes of continentality from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental eight thermotypic horizons from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate and seven ombrotypic horizons from lower dry to lower hyperhumid resulting in a combination of  different isobioclimates during the year there is a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn some heavy showers in the spring and snowfalls in the highlands the average temperature is between  to  °c  to  °f with mild winters and hot summers on the coasts   to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july and cold winters and cool summers on the mountains  − to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july rainfall has a mediterranean distribution all over the island with almost totally rainless summers and wet autumns winters and springs however in summer the rare rainfalls can be characterized by short but severe thunderstorms which can cause flash floods the climate is also heavily influenced by the vicinity of the gulf of genoa barometric low and the relative proximity of the atlantic ocean low pressures in autumn can generate the formation of the socalled medicanes extratropical cyclones which affect the mediterranean basin in  the island was hit by several cyclones included the cyclone cleopatra which dumped

rainstorms  in autumn  it rained more than  mm  in in a single day in siniscola and  november  locations in sardinia were reported to have received more than  mm  inches within two hours the western

land in europe the island was populated in various waves of immigration from prehistory until recent times the first people to settle in sardinia during the upper paleolithic and the mesolithic came probably from the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula the paleolithic colonization of the island is demonstrated by the evidences in olienas corbeddu cave in the mesolithic some populations particularly from presentday tuscany managed to move to northern sardinia via corsica the neolithic revolution was introduced in the th millennium bc by the cardial culture coming from the italian peninsula in the midneolithic period the ozieri culture probably of aegean origin flourished on the island spreading the hypogeum tombs known as domus de janas while the arzachena culture of gallura built the first megaliths circular tombs in the early rd millennium bc began to develop the metallurgy of copper and silver  during the late chalcolithic the socalled beaker culture coming from continental europe appeared in sardinia these new people predominantly settled on the west coast where the majority of the sites attributed to them had been found the beaker culture was followed in the early bronze age by the bonnanaro culture which showed both reminiscences of the beaker and influences by the polada culture as time passed the different sardinian populations appear to have become united in customs yet remained politically divided into various small tribal groupings at times banding together and at others waging war against each other habitations consisted of round thatched stone huts nuraghe losa nuragic civilizationedit main article nuragic civilization from about  bc onwards villages were built around round towerfortresses called nuraghi singular form nuraghe usually pluralized in english as nuraghes these towers were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements tribal boundaries were guarded by smaller lookout nuraghes erected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories today some  nuraghes dot the sardinian landscape while initially these nuraghes had a relatively simple structure with time they became extremely complex and monumental see for example nuraghe santu antine su nuraxi or nuraghe arrubiu the scale complexity and territorial spread of these buildings attest to the level of wealth accumulated by the nuragic people their advances in technology and the complexity of their society which was able to coordinate large numbers of people with different roles for the purpose of building the monumental nuraghes giants grave in dorgali bronze age the nuraghes are not the only nuragic buildings that survive as there are several sacred wells around sardinia and other buildings that had religious purposes such as the giants grave monumental collective tombs and collections of religious buildings that probably served as destinations for pilgrimage and mass religious rites eg su romanzesu near bitti head of one of the socalled giants of monte prama sardinia was at the time at the centre of several commercial routes and it was an important provider of raw materials such as copper and lead which were pivotal for the manufacture of the time by controlling the extraction of these raw materials and by commercing them with other countries the nuragic civilisation was able to accumulate wealth and reach a level of sophistication that is not only reflected in the complexity of its surviving buildings but also in its artworks eg the votive bronze statuettes found across sardinia according to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with the sherden a tribe of the sea peoples the nuragic civilization was linked with other contemporaneous megalithic civilization of the western mediterranean such as the talaiotic culture of the balearic islands and the torrean civilization of south corsica evidence of trade with the other civilizations of the time is attested by several artefacts eg pots coming from as far as cyprus crete mainland greece spain and italy that have been found in nuragic sites bearing witness to the scope of commercial relations between the nuragic people and other peoples in europe and beyond ancient historyedit the phoenician and subsequently roman town of tharros necropolis of tuvixeddu cagliari around the th century bc the phoenicians began visiting sardinia with increasing frequency presumably initially needing safe overnight andor allweather anchorages along their trade routes from the coast of modernday lebanon as far afield as the african and european atlantic coasts and beyond the most common ports of call were caralis nora bithia sulci and tharros claudian a thcentury latin poet in his poem de bello gildonico stated that caralis was founded by people from tyre probably in the same time of the foundation of carthage in the th or th century bc in the th century bc after the conquest of western sicily the carthaginians planned to annex sardinia a first invasion attempt led by malco was foiled by the victorious nuraghic resistance however from  bc the southern and westcentral part of the island was invaded a second time and came under carthaginian rule roman thermae of forum traiani in what is now fordongianus in  bc taking advantage of carthage having to face a rebellion of her mercenaries the mercenary war after the first punic war – bc the romans annexed corsica and sardinia from the carthaginians the two islands became the province of corsica and sardinia they were not given a provincial governor until  bc the romans faced many rebellions and it took them many years to pacify both islands the existing coastal cities were enlarged and embellished and roman colonies such as turris lybissonis and feronia were founded these were populated by roman immigrants the roman military occupation brought the nuragic civilization to an end except for the mountainous interior of the island which the romans called barbaria meaning “barbarian land” roman rule in sardinia lasted  years during which time the province was an important source of grain for the capital latin came to be the dominant spoken language during this period though roman culture was slower to take hold and roman rule was often contested by the sardinian tribes from the mountainous regions vandal conquestedit a vandalperiod coin found in sardinia depicting godas latin legend  rex cvda the east germanic tribe of the vandals conquered sardinia in  their rule lasted for  years up to  when  eastern roman troops led by cyril one of the officers of the foederati retook the island it is known that the vandal government continued the forms of the existing roman imperial structure the governor of sardinia continued to be called the praeses and apparently continued to manage military judicial and civil governmental functions via imperial procedures the only vandal governor of sardinia about whom there is substantial record is the last godas a visigoth noble in ad  a coup détat in carthage removed king hilderic a convert to nicene christianity in favor of his cousin gelimer an arian christian like most of the élite in his kingdom godas was sent to take charge and ensure the loyalty of sardinia he did the exact opposite declaring the islands independence from carthage and opening negotiations with emperor justinian i who had declared war on hilderics behalf in ad  gelimer sent the bulk of his army and navy  vessels and  men to sardinia to subdue godas with the catastrophic result that the vandal kingdom was overwhelmed when justinians own army under belisarius arrived at carthage in their absence the vandal kingdom ended and sardinia was returned to roman rule byzantine era and the rise of the giudicatiedit in  sardinia returned to the rule of the byzantine empire when the vandals were defeated by the armies of justinian i under the general belisarius in the battle of tricamarum in their african kingdom belisarius sent his general cyril to sardinia to retake the island sardinia remained in byzantine hands for the next  years aside from a short period in which it was invaded by the ostrogoths in  under byzantine rule the island was divided into districts called mereíai μερείαι in byzantine greek which were governed by a judge residing in caralis and garrisoned by an army stationed in forum traiani today fordongianus under the command of a dux during this time christianity took deeper root on the island supplanting the paganism which had survived into the early middle ages in the culturally conservative hinterlands along with lay christianity the followers of monastic figures such as basil of caesarea became established in sardinia while christianity penetrated the majority of the population the region of barbagia remained largely pagan and probably partially nonlatin speaking they reestablished a shortlived independent domain with sardinianheathen lay and religious traditions one of its kings being hospito pope gregory i wrote a letter to hospito defining him dux barbaricinorum and being christian the leader and best of his people in this unique letter about hospito the pope prompts him to convert his people who “living all like irrational animals ignore the true god and worship wood and stone” barbaricini omnes ut insensata animalia vivant deum verum nesciant ligna autem et lapides adorent santa sabina byzantine church and nuraghe in silanus the dates and circumstances of the end of byzantine rule in sardinia are not known direct central control was maintained at least through c  after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of gregory the patrician exarch of africa and the first invasion of the muslim conquest of the maghreb there is some evidence that senior byzantine administration in the exarchate of africa retreated to caralis following the final fall of carthage to the arabs in  the loss of imperial control in africa led to escalating raids by moors and berbers on the island the first of which is documented in  forcing increased military selfreliance in the province communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the muslim conquest of sicily between  and  a letter by pope nicholas i as early as  mentions the sardinian judges without reference to the empire and a letter by pope john viii reigned – refers to them as principes princes by the time of de administrando imperio completed in  the byzantine authorities no longer listed sardinia as an imperial province suggesting they considered it lost in all likelihood a local noble family acceded to the power still identifying themselves as vassals of the byzantines but de facto independent as communications with constantinople were very difficult we know only two names of those rulers salusios σαλούσιος and the protospatharios turcoturios tουρκοτούριος from two inscriptions who probably reigned between the th and the th century these rulers were still closely linked to the byzantines both for a pact of ancient vassalage and from the ideological point of view with the use of the greek language in a country of the romance language and the use of art of byzantine inspiration the medieval basilica of san gavino in porto torres th century frescoes in the basilica di saccargia in codrongianos in the early th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by muslims based in spain the only records of that war are from pisan and genoese chronicles the christians won but after that the previous sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four small giudicati cagliari calari arborea arbaree gallura torres or logudoro whether this final transformation from imperial civil servant to independent sovereign resulted from imperial abandonment or local assertion by the th century the giudici sardinian judikes  latin iudices literally judges a byzantine administrative title had emerged as the autonomous rulers of sardinia the title of iudice changed with the language and local understanding of the position becoming the sardinian judike essentially a king or sovereign while giudicato sardinian judicadu literally ‘judgeship’ or ‘judicature’ came to mean state a letter by mieszko i of poland to pope john xv proves that the giudicati were known even in poland and that they played an important role in medieval europe early medieval sardinian political institutions evolved from the millennium old roman imperial structures with relatively little germanic influence although the giudicati were hereditary lordships the old byzantine imperial notion that personal title or honor was separate from the state still remained so the giudicato was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later european feudalism like the imperial systems the new order also preserved semidemocratic forms with national assemblies called the crown of the realm each giudicato saw to its own defense maintained its own laws and administration and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs the history of the four giudicati would be defined by the contest for influence between the rival rising sea powers of genoa and pisa and later the ambitions of the kingdom of aragon sardinian giudicati the giudicato of cagliari or pluminos during the regency of torchitorio v of cagliari and his successor william iii was allied with the republic of genoa for this it was brought to an end in  when its capital santa igia was stormed and destroyed by an alliance of sardinian and pisan forces the territory then was divided between republic of pisa the della gherardesca family and the giudicati of arborea and gallura pisa maintained the control over the fortress of castel di cagliari founded by pisan merchants in  east of santa igia in the southwest the count ugolino della gherardesca promoted the birth of the town of villa di chiesa today iglesias to exploit the nearby rich silver deposits the giudicato of logudoro sometimes called torres was also allied to the republic of genoa and came to an end in  after the death of the judikessa queen adelasia the territory was divided up between the doria and malaspina families of genoa and the basserra family of arborea while the city of sassari became a small republic like the italian citystates comuni confederated firstly with pisa and then with genoa the giudicato of gallura ended in the year  when the last giudice nino visconti a friend of dante alighieri was driven out by the pisans who occupied the territory the giudicato of arborea having oristano as its capital had a longer life compared to the other kingdoms its later history is entwined with the attempt to unify the island into a single sardinian state republica sardisca against their relatives and former aragonese allies aragonese periodedit in  pope boniface viii established on his own initiative motu proprio a hypothetical regnum sardiniae et corsicae kingdom of sardinia and corsica in order to settle the war of the sicilian vespers diplomatically this had broken out in  between the capetian house of anjou and catalans over the possession of sicily despite the existence of the indigenous states the pope offered this newly created crown to james ii of aragon promising him support should he wish to conquer pisan sardinia in exchange for sicily the proclamation of the republic of sassari the sassarese republic lasted from  until  when it sided with the new born kingdom of sardinia in  in alliance with the kingdom of arborea and following a military campaign that lasted a year or so the aragon crown prince alfonso led a catalan army that occupied the pisan territories of cagliari and gallura along with the allied city of sassari naming them the kingdom of sardinia and corsica the kingdom was to remain a dominion of the crown of aragon under the kings of spain until the treaty of utrecht during this period the giudicato of arborea promulgated the legal code of the kingdom in the carta de logu ‘charter of the land’ the carta de logu was originally compiled by marianus iv of arborea and was amended and updated by marianos daughter female judge judikessa or juighissa eleanor of arborea the legal code was written in sardinian and established a whole range of citizens rights among the revolutionary concepts in this carta de logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property in terms of civil liberties the code made provincial th century sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of europe in  peter iv of aragon following aragonese customs granted a parliament to the kingdom of sardinia and corsica which was followed by some degree of selfgovernment under a viceroy and judicial independence this parliament however had limited powers it consisted of highranking military commanders the clergy and the nobility the kingdom of aragon also introduced the feudal system into the areas of sardinia that it ruled the sardinian giudicati never adopted feudalism and arborea maintained its parliament called the corona de logu crown of the realm in this parliament apart from the nobles and military commanders also sat the representatives of each township and village the corona de logu exercised some control over the king under the rule of the bannus consensus the king could be deposed or even executed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom statue of judichessa eleanor of arborea in oristano broken the alliance with the crown of aragon from  to  the arborean giudici marianus iv hugh iii and brancaleone doria husband of eleanor of arborea succeeded in occupying all of sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the castle of cagliari and alghero which for years remained as the only aragonese dominions in sardinia in  martin i of sicily king of sicily and heir to the crown of aragon defeated the sardinians at the battle of sanluri the battle was fought by about  sardinian genoese and french knights enrolled from their kingdom at a time when the population of sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague despite the sardinian army outnumbering the aragonese army they were defeated the giudicato of arborea disappeared in  when its rights were sold by the last king for  gold florins and after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges for example leonardo cubello with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the kings of arborea was granted the title of marquis of oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the kingdom of arborea in exchange for his subjection to the aragonese monarchs the conquest of sardinia by the kingdom of aragon meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout sardinia thus sardinia is probably the only european country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the middle ages to the early modern period at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other european countries spanish periodedit flag of the kingdom of

consequence of the spanish war of succession the rule of the kingdom of sardinia passed from king philip v of spain into the hands of the austrians who occupied the island the treaty of utrecht granted sardinia to the austrians but in  cardinal giulio alberoni minister of philip v of spain reoccupied sardinia in  with the treaty of london sardinia was handed over to the house of savoy that would impose the italian language on the island in  the french siege of cagliari and quartu in  sardinians repelled two french invasions on  february  domenico millelire commanding the sardinian fleet defeated the fleets of the french republic near the maddalena archipelago of which thenlieutenant napoleon bonaparte was a leader millelire became the first recipient of the gold medal of military valor of the italian armed forces in the same month sardinians stopped the attempted french landing on the beach of quartu santelena near the capital of cagliari because of these successes the representatives of nobility and clergy stamenti formulated five requests addressed to the king victor amadeus iii of sardinia but they got refused because of this discontent on  april  during an uprising in cagliari two savoyard officials were killed that was the start of a revolt called the sardinian vespers in the island which culminated on  april  commemorated today as sa die de sa sardigna with the expulsion or even execution of the piedmontese officers for a few days from the capital cagliari gm angioy entry into sassari on  december  in sassari insurgents demonstrating against feudalism mainly from the region of logudoro occupied the city on  february  in order to prevent the spread of the revolt the viceroy filippo vivalda gave the sardinian magistrate giovanni maria angioy the role of alternos which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself angioy moved from cagliari to sassari and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising demanding an end to feudalism and aiming to declare the island to be an independent republic but once he was outnumbered by loyalist forces he fled to paris and sought support for a french annexation of the island in  the islet near sardinia was attacked by the tunisians and over  inhabitants were taken away as slaves the final muslim attack on the island was on santantioco on  october  over a millennium since the first in  as a consequence of the napoleonic wars in italy the savoy royal family left turin and took refuge in cagliari for some fifteen years in  the sardinian parliaments stamenti in order to get the piedmontese liberal reforms they could not afford due to their separated legal system renounced their state autonomy and agreed to form a union with piedmont savoy nice and liguria in order to have a single parliament a single magistracy and a single government in turin this move aggravated the islands peripheral condition and most of the prounion supporters including its leader giovanni siotto pintor would later regret it sardinians wearing traditional clothing s in  the savoyards imposed the enclosures act editto delle chiudende on the island aimed at turning the lands traditional collective ownership a cultural and economic cornerstone of sardinia since the nuragic times to private property this gave rise to many abuses as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor sardinian farmers and shepherds who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land many local rebellions like the nuorese su connottu the already known in sardinian riot in  all repressed by the kings army resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land however the common lands called ademprivios were never completely abolished and they are still present in large number to this day  hectares of common lands were counted in  of which  constituted by woods in  the confederation of states powered by the savoyard kings of sardinia became a unitarian and constitutional state and moved to the italian wars of independence for the unification of italy that were led for thirteen years in  being italy united by a debated war campaign the parliament of the kingdom of sardinia decided by law to change its name and the title of its king in kingdom of italy and king of italy most sardinian forests were cut down at this time in order to provide the piedmontese with raw materials like wood used to make railway sleepers on the mainland the extension of the primary natural forests praised by every traveller visiting sardinia would in fact be reduced to  of their original number being little more than  hectares at the end of the century during the first world war the sardinian soldiers of the brigata sassari distinguished themselves it was the first and only regional military unit in italy since the people enrolled were only sardinians the regiment suffered heavy losses and earned four gold metals sardinia lost more young people than any other italian region on the front with  casualties per  soldiers compared to the italian average of  casualties during the fascist period with the implementation of the policy of autarky several swamps around the island were reclaimed and agrarian communities founded the main communities were the village of mussolinia now called arborea populated by farmers from veneto and friuli in the area of oristano and fertilia populated at first by settlers from the ferrara area followed after world war ii by a notable number of istrian italians and dalmatian italians hailing from territories lost to yugoslavia in the area adjacent the city of alghero within the region of nurra  also established during that time  was the city of carbonia which became the main centre of coal mining activity that attracted thousand of workers from the rest of the island and the italian mainland the sardinian writer grazia deledda won the nobel prize for literature in  effect of allied bombing on cagliari during the second world war during the second world war sardinia was an important air and naval base and was heavily bombed by the allies especially the city of cagliari german troops left the island on  september  a few days after the armistice of cassibile and retired to corsica without fighting and bloodshed after a bilateral agreement between the general antonio basso commander of the armed forces of sardinia and the german karl hans lungerhausen general of the th panzergrenadier division postsecond world war periodedit in  by popular referendum italy became a republic with sardinia being administered since  by a special statute of autonomy by  malaria was successfully eliminated by the erlaas antimalaric regional authority and the support of the rockefeller foundation which facilitated the commencement of the sardinian tourist boom with the increase in tourism coal decreased in importance but sardinia followed the italian economic miracle super yachts anchored at porto cervo port costa smeralda in the early s an industrialisation effort was commenced the socalled piani di rinascita rebirth plans with the initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island these included the construction of new dams and roads reforestation agricultural zones on reclaimed marshland and large industrial complexes primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations with the creation of petrochemical industries thousands of exfarmers became industrial workers the  oil crisis caused the termination of employment for thousands of workers employed in the petrochemical industries which aggravated the emigration already present in the s and s sardinia faced the creation of military bases on the island like decimomannu air base and salto di quirra the biggest scientific military base in europe in the same decades even now around  of all italian and nato military installations in italy are on sardinia whose area is less than onetenth of all the italian territory and whose population is little more than the  furthermore they comprise over  hectares used for experimental weapons testing where  of the military explosives in italy are used sardinian nationalism and local protest movements became stronger in the s and a number of bandits anonima sarda started a long series of kidnappings which ended only in the s this also gave rise to various militant groups that blended separatist and communist ideas the most famous being barbagia rossa and the sardinian armed movement which perpetrated several bombings and terrorist actions between the s and the s in the span of just two years –  bombing attacks were reported santo stefanos former nato naval base in  a prominent activist of a separatist party the sardinian action party partidu sardu – partito sardo dazione was elected president of the regional parliament and in the s several other movements calling for independence from italy were born in the s some of them became political parties even if in a rather disjointed manner it was not until  that the islands languages sardinian sassarese gallurese algherese and tabarchino were recognised even if just formally together with italian the th g summit was planned by prodi ii cabinet to be held in sardinia on the island of la maddalena in july  however in april  the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi decided without convoking the italian parliament or consulting the sardinian governor of his own party to move the summit even though the works were almost completed to laquila provoking heavy protests today sardinia is phasing in as an eu region with a diversified economy focused on tourism and the tertiary sector the economic efforts

been influenced by catalan spanish and recently italian while the once spoken nuragic contributes many features to it in many ancient remnants in  the regional administration has approved the use of a standardised writing system the socalled limba sarda comuna in official acts as a literary language sardinian is gaining importance despite heated debate about the lack of a commonly acknowledged standard orthography and controversial proposed solutions to this problem the two most widely spoken forms of the language are the southern dialects known as campidanese sardu campidanesu and the northern dialects known as logudorese sardu logudoresu extending almost to the suburbs of sassari the sardinian language is quite different from the other romance languages and is homogeneous in terms of morphology syntax and lexicon but it also shows a spectrum of variation in terms of phonetics between the northern and the southern dialects sassarese sassaresu and gallurese gadduresu are

testifies to the names existence when the phoenician merchants first arrived according to timaeus one of platos dialogues sardinia and its people as well might have been named after sardò σαρδώ a legendary woman born in sardis σάρδεις capital of the ancient kingdom of lydia there has also been speculation that identifies the ancient nuragic sards with the sherden one of the sea peoples it is suggested that the name had a religious connotation from its use also as the adjective for the ancient sardinian mythological herogod sardus pater sardinian father in modern times misunderstood as being father sardus as well as being the stem of the adjective sardonic in classical antiquity sardinia was called ichnusa the latinised form of ancient greek υκνούσσα σανδάλιον sandal sardinia and sardó σαρδώ geographyedit topographic map of sardinia the southern coast of corsica as seen from santa teresa gallura cala goloritzé baunei view of gennargentu the highest massif of sardinia a

mediterranean sea is directly to the east of sardinia between the sardinian east coast and the west coast of the italian mainland peninsula the strait of bonifacio is directly north of sardinia and separates sardinia from the french island of corsica the coasts of sardinia  kilometres  miles long are generally high and rocky with long relatively straight stretches of coastline many outstanding headlands a few wide deep bays rias many inlets and with various smaller islands off the coast the island has an ancient geoformation and unlike sicily and mainland italy is not earthquakeprone its rocks date in fact from the palaeozoic era up to  million years old due to long erosion processes the islands highlands formed of granite schist trachyte basalt called jaras or gollei sandstone and dolomite limestone called tonneri or heels average at between  to  metres  to  feet the highest peak is punta la marmora perdas carpìas in sardinian language m  ft part of the gennargentu ranges in

lake is lago di baratz a number of large shallow saltwater lagoons and pools are located along the  km  mi of the coastline climateedit sardinia average rainfalls the climate of the island is variable from area to area due to several factors including the extension in latitude and the elevation it can be classified in two different macrobioclimates mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and temperate oceanic one macrobioclimatic variant called submediterranean and four classes of continentality from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental eight thermotypic horizons from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate and seven ombrotypic horizons from lower dry to lower hyperhumid resulting in a combination of  different isobioclimates during the year there is a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn some heavy showers in the spring and snowfalls in the highlands the average temperature is between  to  °c  to  °f with mild winters and hot summers on the coasts   to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july and cold winters and cool summers on the mountains  − to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july rainfall has a mediterranean distribution all over the island with almost totally rainless summers and wet autumns winters and springs however in summer the rare rainfalls can be characterized by short but severe thunderstorms which can cause flash floods the climate is also heavily influenced by the vicinity of the gulf of genoa barometric low and the relative proximity of the atlantic ocean low pressures in autumn can

land in europe the island was populated in various waves of immigration from prehistory until recent times the first people to settle in sardinia during the upper paleolithic and the mesolithic came probably from the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula the paleolithic colonization of the island is demonstrated by the evidences in olienas corbeddu cave in the mesolithic some populations particularly from presentday tuscany managed to move to northern sardinia via corsica the neolithic revolution was introduced in the th millennium bc by the cardial culture coming from the italian peninsula in the midneolithic period the ozieri culture probably of aegean origin flourished on the island spreading the hypogeum tombs known as domus de janas while the arzachena culture of gallura built the first megaliths circular tombs in the early rd millennium bc began to develop the metallurgy of copper and silver  during the late chalcolithic the socalled beaker culture coming from continental europe appeared in sardinia these new people predominantly settled on the west coast where the majority of the sites attributed to them had been found the beaker culture was followed in the early bronze age by the bonnanaro culture which showed both reminiscences of the beaker and influences by the polada culture as time passed the different sardinian populations appear to have become united in customs yet remained politically divided into various small tribal groupings at times banding together and at others waging war against each other habitations consisted of round thatched stone huts nuraghe losa nuragic civilizationedit main article nuragic civilization from about  bc onwards villages were built around round towerfortresses called nuraghi singular form nuraghe usually pluralized in english as nuraghes these towers were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements tribal boundaries were guarded by smaller lookout nuraghes erected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories today some  nuraghes dot the sardinian landscape while initially these nuraghes had a relatively simple structure with time they became extremely complex and monumental see for example nuraghe santu antine su nuraxi or nuraghe arrubiu the scale complexity and territorial spread of these buildings attest to the level of wealth accumulated by the nuragic people their advances in technology and the complexity of their society which was able to coordinate large numbers of people with different roles for the purpose of building the monumental nuraghes giants grave in dorgali bronze age the nuraghes are not the only nuragic buildings that survive as there are several sacred wells around sardinia and other buildings that had religious purposes such as the giants grave monumental collective tombs and collections of religious buildings that probably served as destinations for pilgrimage and mass religious rites eg su romanzesu near bitti head of one of the socalled giants of monte prama sardinia was at the time at the centre of several commercial routes and it was an important provider of raw materials such as copper and lead which were pivotal for the manufacture of the time by controlling the extraction of these raw materials and by commercing them with other countries the nuragic civilisation was able to accumulate wealth and reach a level of sophistication that is not only reflected in the complexity of its surviving buildings but also in its artworks eg the votive bronze statuettes found across sardinia according to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with the sherden a tribe of the sea peoples the nuragic civilization was linked with other contemporaneous megalithic civilization of the western mediterranean such as the talaiotic culture of the balearic islands and the torrean civilization of south corsica evidence of trade with the other civilizations of the time is attested by several artefacts eg pots coming from as far as cyprus crete mainland greece spain and italy that have been found in nuragic sites bearing witness to the scope of commercial relations between the nuragic people and other peoples in europe and beyond ancient historyedit the phoenician and subsequently roman town of tharros necropolis of tuvixeddu cagliari around the th century bc the phoenicians began visiting sardinia with increasing frequency presumably initially needing safe overnight andor allweather anchorages along their trade routes from the coast of modernday lebanon as far afield as the african and european atlantic coasts and beyond the most common ports of call were caralis nora bithia sulci and tharros claudian a thcentury latin poet in his poem de bello gildonico stated that caralis was founded by people from tyre probably in the same time of the foundation of carthage in the th or th century bc in the th century bc after the conquest of western sicily the carthaginians planned to annex sardinia a first invasion attempt led by malco was foiled by the victorious nuraghic resistance however from  bc the southern and westcentral part of the island was invaded a second time and came under carthaginian rule roman thermae of forum traiani in what is now fordongianus in  bc taking advantage of carthage having to face a rebellion of her mercenaries the mercenary war after the first punic war – bc the romans annexed corsica and sardinia from the carthaginians the two islands became the province of corsica and sardinia they were not given a provincial governor until  bc the romans faced many rebellions and it took them many years to pacify both islands the existing coastal cities were enlarged and embellished and roman colonies such as turris lybissonis and feronia were founded these were populated by roman immigrants the roman military occupation brought the nuragic civilization to an end except for the mountainous interior of the island which the romans called barbaria meaning “barbarian land” roman rule in sardinia lasted  years during which time the province was an important source of grain for the capital latin came to be the dominant spoken language during this period though roman culture was slower to take hold and roman rule was often contested by the sardinian tribes from the mountainous regions vandal conquestedit a vandalperiod coin found in sardinia depicting godas latin legend  rex cvda the east germanic tribe of the vandals conquered sardinia in  their rule lasted for  years up to  when  eastern roman troops led by cyril one of the officers of the foederati retook the island it is known that the vandal government continued the forms of the existing roman imperial structure the governor of sardinia continued to be called the praeses and apparently continued to manage military judicial and civil governmental functions via imperial procedures the only vandal governor of sardinia about whom there is substantial record is the last godas a visigoth noble in ad  a coup détat in carthage removed king hilderic a convert to nicene christianity in favor of his cousin gelimer an arian christian like most of the élite in his kingdom godas was sent to take charge and ensure the loyalty of sardinia he did the exact opposite declaring the islands independence from carthage and opening negotiations with emperor justinian i who had declared war on hilderics behalf in ad  gelimer sent the bulk of his army and navy  vessels and  men to sardinia to subdue godas with the catastrophic result that the vandal kingdom was overwhelmed when justinians own army under belisarius arrived at carthage in their absence the vandal kingdom ended and sardinia was returned to roman rule byzantine era and the rise of the giudicatiedit in  sardinia returned to the rule of the byzantine empire when the vandals were defeated by the armies of justinian i under the general belisarius in the battle of tricamarum in their african kingdom belisarius sent his general cyril to sardinia to retake the island sardinia remained in byzantine hands for the next  years aside from a short period in which it was invaded by the ostrogoths in  under byzantine rule the island was divided into districts called mereíai μερείαι in byzantine greek which were governed by a judge residing in caralis and garrisoned by an army stationed in forum traiani today fordongianus under the command of a dux during this time christianity took deeper root on the island supplanting the paganism which had survived into the early middle ages in the culturally conservative hinterlands along with lay christianity the followers of monastic figures such as basil of caesarea became established in sardinia while christianity penetrated the majority of the population the region of barbagia remained largely pagan and probably partially nonlatin speaking they reestablished a shortlived independent domain with sardinianheathen lay and religious traditions one of its kings being hospito pope gregory i wrote a letter to hospito defining him dux barbaricinorum and being christian the leader and best of his people in this unique letter about hospito the pope prompts him to convert his people who “living all like irrational animals ignore the true god and worship wood and stone” barbaricini omnes ut insensata animalia vivant deum verum nesciant ligna autem et lapides adorent santa sabina byzantine church and nuraghe in silanus the dates and circumstances of the end of byzantine rule in sardinia are not known direct central control was maintained at least through c  after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of gregory the patrician exarch of africa and the first invasion of the muslim conquest of the maghreb there is some evidence that senior byzantine administration in the exarchate of africa retreated to caralis following the final fall of carthage to the arabs in  the loss of imperial control in africa led to escalating raids by moors and berbers on the island the first of which is documented in  forcing increased military selfreliance in the province communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the muslim conquest of sicily between  and  a letter by pope nicholas i as early as  mentions the sardinian judges without reference to the empire and a letter by pope john viii reigned – refers to them as principes princes by the time of de administrando imperio completed in  the byzantine authorities no longer listed sardinia as an imperial province suggesting they considered it lost in all likelihood a local noble family acceded to the power still identifying themselves as vassals of the byzantines but de facto independent as communications with constantinople were very difficult we know only two names of those rulers salusios σαλούσιος and the protospatharios turcoturios tουρκοτούριος from two inscriptions who probably reigned between the th and the th century these rulers were still closely linked to the byzantines both for a pact of ancient vassalage and from the ideological point of view with the use of the greek language in a country of the romance language and the use of art of byzantine inspiration the medieval basilica of san gavino in porto torres th century frescoes in the basilica di saccargia in codrongianos in the early th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by muslims based in spain the only records of that war are from pisan and genoese chronicles the christians won but after that the previous sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four small giudicati cagliari calari arborea arbaree gallura torres or logudoro whether this final transformation from imperial civil servant to independent sovereign resulted from imperial abandonment or local assertion by the th century the giudici sardinian judikes  latin iudices literally judges a byzantine administrative title had emerged as the autonomous rulers of sardinia the title of iudice changed with the language and local understanding of the position becoming the sardinian judike essentially a king or sovereign while giudicato sardinian judicadu literally ‘judgeship’ or ‘judicature’ came to mean state a letter by mieszko i of poland to pope john xv proves that the giudicati were known even in poland and that they played an important role in medieval europe early medieval sardinian political institutions evolved from the millennium old roman imperial structures with relatively little germanic influence although the giudicati were hereditary lordships the old byzantine imperial notion that personal title or honor was separate from the state still remained so the giudicato was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later european feudalism like the imperial systems the new order also preserved semidemocratic forms with national assemblies called the crown of the realm each giudicato saw to its own defense maintained its own laws and administration and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs the history of the four giudicati would be defined by the contest for influence between the rival rising sea powers of genoa and pisa and later the ambitions of the kingdom of aragon sardinian giudicati the giudicato of cagliari or pluminos during the regency of torchitorio v of cagliari and his successor william iii was allied with the republic of genoa for this it was brought to an end in  when its capital santa igia was stormed and destroyed by an alliance of sardinian and pisan forces the territory then was divided between republic of pisa the della gherardesca family and the giudicati of arborea and gallura pisa maintained the control over the fortress of castel di cagliari founded by pisan merchants in  east of santa igia in the southwest the count ugolino della gherardesca promoted the birth of the town of villa di chiesa today iglesias to exploit the nearby rich silver deposits the giudicato of logudoro sometimes called torres was also allied to the republic of genoa and came to an end in  after the death of the judikessa queen adelasia the territory was divided up between the doria and malaspina families of genoa and the basserra family of arborea while the city of sassari became a small republic like the italian citystates comuni confederated firstly with pisa and then with genoa the giudicato of gallura ended in the year  when the last giudice nino visconti a friend of dante alighieri was driven out by the pisans who occupied the territory the giudicato of arborea having oristano as its capital had a longer life compared to the other kingdoms its later history is entwined with the attempt to unify the island into a single sardinian state republica sardisca against their relatives and former aragonese allies aragonese periodedit in  pope boniface viii established on his own initiative motu proprio a hypothetical regnum sardiniae et corsicae kingdom of sardinia and corsica in order to settle the war of the sicilian vespers diplomatically this had broken out in  between the capetian house of anjou and catalans over the possession of sicily despite the existence of the indigenous states the pope offered this newly created crown to james ii of aragon promising him support should he wish to conquer pisan sardinia in exchange for sicily the proclamation of the republic of sassari the sassarese republic lasted from  until  when it sided with the new born kingdom of sardinia in  in alliance with the kingdom of arborea and following a military campaign that lasted a year or so the aragon crown prince alfonso led a catalan army that occupied the pisan territories of cagliari and gallura along with the allied city of sassari naming them the kingdom of sardinia and corsica the kingdom was to remain a dominion of the crown of aragon under the kings of spain until the treaty of utrecht during this period the giudicato of arborea promulgated the legal code of the kingdom in the carta de logu ‘charter of the land’ the carta de logu was originally compiled by marianus iv of arborea and was amended and updated by marianos daughter female judge judikessa or juighissa eleanor of arborea the legal code was written in sardinian and established a whole range of citizens rights among the revolutionary concepts in this carta de logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property in terms of civil liberties the code made provincial th century sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of europe in  peter iv of aragon following aragonese customs granted a parliament to the kingdom of sardinia and corsica which was followed by some degree of selfgovernment under a viceroy and judicial independence this parliament however had limited powers it consisted of highranking military commanders the clergy and the nobility the kingdom of aragon also introduced the feudal system into the areas of sardinia that it ruled the sardinian giudicati never adopted feudalism and arborea maintained its parliament called the corona de logu crown of the realm in this parliament apart from the nobles and military commanders also sat the representatives of each township and village the corona de logu exercised some control over the king under the rule of the bannus consensus the king could be deposed or even executed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom statue of judichessa eleanor of arborea in oristano broken the alliance with the crown of aragon from  to  the arborean giudici marianus iv hugh iii and brancaleone doria husband of eleanor of arborea succeeded in occupying all of sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the castle of cagliari and alghero which for years remained as the only aragonese dominions in sardinia in  martin i of sicily king of sicily and heir to the crown of aragon defeated the sardinians at the battle of sanluri the battle was fought by about  sardinian genoese and french knights enrolled from their kingdom at a time when the population of sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague despite the sardinian army outnumbering the aragonese army they were defeated the giudicato of arborea disappeared in  when its rights were sold by the last king for  gold florins and after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges for example leonardo cubello with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the kings of arborea was granted the title of marquis of oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the kingdom of arborea in exchange for his subjection to the aragonese monarchs the conquest of sardinia by the kingdom of aragon meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout sardinia thus sardinia is probably the only european country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the middle ages to the early modern period at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other european countries spanish periodedit flag of the kingdom of sardinia center at the funeral of charles i of spain in  the heir to sardinia ferdinand ii of aragon married isabel of castile and the kingdom of sardinia which was separated from corsica was to be

consequence of the spanish war of succession the rule of the kingdom of sardinia passed from king philip v of spain into the hands of the austrians who occupied the island the treaty of utrecht granted sardinia to the austrians but in  cardinal giulio alberoni minister of philip v of spain reoccupied sardinia in  with the treaty of london sardinia was handed over to the house of savoy that would impose the italian language on the island in  the french siege of cagliari and quartu in  sardinians repelled two french invasions on  february  domenico millelire commanding the sardinian fleet defeated the fleets of the french republic near the maddalena archipelago of which thenlieutenant napoleon bonaparte was a leader millelire became the first recipient of the gold medal of military valor of the italian armed forces in the same month sardinians stopped the attempted french landing on the beach of quartu santelena near the capital of cagliari because of these successes the representatives of nobility and clergy stamenti formulated five requests addressed to the king victor amadeus iii of sardinia but they got refused because of this discontent on  april  during an uprising in cagliari two savoyard officials were killed that was the start of a revolt called the sardinian vespers in the island which culminated on  april  commemorated today as sa die de sa sardigna with the expulsion or even execution of the piedmontese officers for a few days from the capital cagliari gm angioy entry into sassari on  december  in sassari insurgents demonstrating against feudalism mainly from the region of logudoro occupied the city on  february  in order to prevent the spread of the revolt the viceroy filippo vivalda gave the sardinian magistrate giovanni maria angioy the role of alternos which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself angioy moved from cagliari to sassari and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising demanding an end to feudalism and aiming to declare the island to be an independent republic but once he was outnumbered by loyalist forces he fled to paris and sought support for a french annexation of the island in  the islet near sardinia was attacked by the tunisians and over  inhabitants were taken away as slaves the final muslim attack on the island was on santantioco on  october  over a millennium since the first in  as a consequence of the napoleonic wars in italy the savoy royal family left turin and took refuge in cagliari for some fifteen years in  the sardinian parliaments stamenti in order to get the piedmontese liberal reforms they could not afford due to their separated legal system renounced their state autonomy and agreed to form a union with piedmont savoy nice and liguria in order to have a single parliament a single magistracy and a single government in turin this move aggravated the islands peripheral condition and most of the prounion supporters including its leader giovanni siotto pintor would later regret it sardinians wearing traditional clothing s in  the savoyards imposed the enclosures act editto delle chiudende on the island aimed at turning the lands traditional collective ownership a cultural and economic cornerstone of sardinia since the nuragic times to private property this gave rise to many abuses as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor sardinian farmers and shepherds who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land many local rebellions like the nuorese su connottu the already known in sardinian riot in  all repressed by the kings army resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land however the common lands called ademprivios were never completely abolished and they are still present in large number to this day  hectares of common lands were counted in  of which  constituted by woods in  the confederation of states powered by the savoyard kings of sardinia became a unitarian and constitutional state and moved to the italian wars of independence for the unification of italy that were led for thirteen years in  being italy united by a debated war campaign the parliament of the kingdom of sardinia decided by law to change its name and the title of its king in kingdom of italy and king of italy most sardinian forests were cut down at this time in order to provide the piedmontese with raw materials like wood used to make railway sleepers on the mainland the extension of the primary natural forests praised by every traveller visiting sardinia would in fact be reduced to  of their original number being little more than  hectares at the end of the century during the first world war the sardinian soldiers of the brigata sassari distinguished themselves it was the first and only regional military unit in italy since the people enrolled were only sardinians the regiment suffered heavy losses and earned four gold metals sardinia lost more young people than any other italian region on the front with  casualties per  soldiers compared to the italian average of  casualties during the fascist period with the implementation of the policy of autarky several swamps around the island were reclaimed and agrarian communities founded the main communities were the village of mussolinia now called arborea populated by farmers from veneto and friuli in the area of oristano and fertilia populated at first by settlers from the ferrara area followed after world war ii by a notable number of istrian italians and dalmatian italians hailing from territories lost to yugoslavia in the area adjacent the city of alghero within the region of nurra  also established during that time  was the city of carbonia which became the main centre of coal mining activity that attracted thousand of workers from the rest of the island and the italian mainland the sardinian writer grazia deledda won the nobel

initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island these included the construction of new dams and roads reforestation agricultural zones on reclaimed marshland and large industrial complexes primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations with the creation of petrochemical industries thousands of exfarmers became industrial workers the  oil crisis caused the termination of employment for thousands of workers employed in the petrochemical industries which aggravated the emigration already present in the s and s sardinia faced the creation of military bases on the island like decimomannu air base and salto di quirra the biggest scientific military base in europe in the same decades even now around  of all italian and nato military installations in italy are on sardinia whose area is less than onetenth of all the italian territory and whose population is little more than the  furthermore they comprise over  hectares used for experimental weapons testing where  of the military explosives in italy are used sardinian nationalism and local protest movements became stronger in the s and a number of bandits anonima sarda started a long series of kidnappings which ended only in the s this also gave rise to various militant groups that blended separatist and communist ideas the most famous being barbagia rossa and the sardinian armed movement which perpetrated several bombings and terrorist actions between the s and the s in the span of just two years –  bombing attacks were reported santo stefanos former nato naval base in  a prominent activist of a separatist party the sardinian action party partidu sardu – partito sardo dazione was elected president of the regional parliament and in the s several other movements calling for

closer to its latin roots than italian itself sardinian has been formally recognized as one of the twelve historical language minorities of italy since  by regional and italian law the language has been influenced by catalan spanish and recently italian while the once spoken nuragic contributes many features to it in many ancient remnants in  the regional administration has approved the use of a standardised writing system the socalled limba sarda comuna in official acts as a literary language sardinian is gaining importance despite heated debate about the lack of a commonly acknowledged standard orthography and controversial proposed solutions to this problem the two most widely spoken forms of the language are the southern dialects known as campidanese sardu campidanesu and the northern dialects known as logudorese sardu logudoresu extending almost to the suburbs of sassari the sardinian language is quite different from the other romance languages and is homogeneous in terms of morphology syntax and lexicon but it also shows a spectrum of variation in terms of phonetics between the northern and the southern dialects sassarese sassaresu and gallurese gadduresu are

testifies to the names existence when the phoenician merchants first arrived according to timaeus one of platos dialogues sardinia and its people as well might have been named after sardò σαρδώ a legendary woman born in sardis σάρδεις capital of the ancient kingdom of lydia there has also been speculation that identifies the ancient nuragic sards with the sherden one of the sea peoples it is suggested that the name had a religious connotation from its use also as the adjective for the ancient sardinian mythological herogod sardus pater sardinian father in modern times misunderstood as being father sardus as well as being the stem of the adjective sardonic in classical antiquity sardinia was called ichnusa the latinised form of ancient greek υκνούσσα σανδάλιον sandal sardinia and sardó σαρδώ geographyedit topographic map of sardinia the southern coast of corsica as seen from santa teresa gallura cala goloritzé baunei view of gennargentu the highest massif of sardinia a

separates sardinia from the french island of corsica the coasts of sardinia  kilometres  miles long are generally high and rocky with long relatively straight stretches of coastline many outstanding headlands a few wide deep bays rias many inlets and with various smaller islands off the coast the island has an ancient geoformation and unlike sicily and mainland italy is not earthquakeprone its rocks date in fact from the palaeozoic era up to  million years old due to long erosion processes the islands highlands formed of granite schist trachyte basalt called jaras or gollei sandstone and dolomite limestone called tonneri or heels average at between  to  metres  to  feet the highest peak is punta la marmora perdas carpìas in sardinian language m  ft part of the gennargentu ranges in

lake is lago di baratz a number of large shallow saltwater lagoons and pools are located along the  km  mi of the coastline climateedit sardinia average rainfalls the climate of the island is variable from area to area due to several factors including the extension in latitude and the elevation it can be classified in two different macrobioclimates mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and temperate oceanic one macrobioclimatic variant called submediterranean and four classes of continentality from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental eight thermotypic horizons from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate and seven ombrotypic horizons from lower dry to lower hyperhumid resulting in a combination of  different isobioclimates during the year there is a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn some heavy showers in the spring and snowfalls in the highlands the average temperature is between  to  °c  to  °f with mild winters and hot summers on the coasts   to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july and cold winters and cool summers on the mountains  − to  °c  to  °f in january  to  °c  to  °f in july rainfall has a mediterranean distribution all over the island with almost totally rainless summers and wet autumns winters and springs however in summer the rare rainfalls can be characterized by short but severe thunderstorms which can cause flash floods the climate is also heavily influenced by the vicinity of the gulf of genoa barometric low and the relative proximity of the atlantic ocean low pressures in autumn can generate the formation of the socalled medicanes extratropical cyclones which affect the mediterranean basin in  the island was hit by several cyclones included the cyclone cleopatra which dumped almost  inches  mm of rainfall within an hour and a half sardinia being relatively large and hilly weather is not uniform in particular the east is drier but paradoxically it suffers the worst rainstorms  in autumn  it rained more than  mm  in in a single day in siniscola and  november  locations in sardinia were reported to have received more than  mm  inches within two hours the western coast has a higher distribution of rainfalls even for modest elevations for instance iglesias elevation  m  ft average annual precipitation  mm  in the driest part of the island is the coast of cagliari gulf with less than  mm  in per year the minimum is at capo carbonara at the extreme southeast of the island  mm  in and the wettest is the top of the gennargentu mountain with almost  mm  in per year the average for the entire island is about  mm  in per year which is more than enough for the needs of the population and vegetation the mistral from the northwest is the dominant wind on and off throughout the year though it is most prevalent in winter and spring it can blow quite strongly but it is usually dry and cool climate data for cagliari altitude  m month jan feb mar apr may jun

land in europe the island was populated in various waves of immigration from prehistory until recent times the first people to settle in sardinia during the upper paleolithic and the mesolithic came probably from the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula the paleolithic colonization of the island is demonstrated by the evidences in olienas corbeddu cave in the mesolithic some populations particularly from presentday tuscany managed to move to northern sardinia via corsica the neolithic revolution was introduced in the th millennium bc by the cardial culture coming from the italian peninsula in the midneolithic period the ozieri culture probably of aegean origin flourished on the island spreading the hypogeum tombs known as domus de janas while the arzachena culture of gallura built the first megaliths circular tombs in the early rd millennium bc began to develop the metallurgy of copper and silver  during the late chalcolithic the socalled beaker culture coming from continental europe appeared in sardinia these new people predominantly settled on the west coast where the majority of the sites attributed to them had been found the beaker culture was followed in the early bronze age by the bonnanaro culture which showed both reminiscences of the beaker and influences by the polada culture as time passed the different sardinian populations appear to have become united in customs yet remained politically divided into various small tribal groupings at times banding together and at others waging war against each other habitations consisted of round

usually pluralized in english as nuraghes these towers were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements tribal boundaries were guarded by smaller lookout nuraghes erected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories today some  nuraghes dot the sardinian landscape while initially these nuraghes had a relatively simple structure with time they became extremely complex and monumental see for example nuraghe santu antine su nuraxi or nuraghe arrubiu the scale complexity and territorial spread of these buildings attest to the level of wealth accumulated by the nuragic people their advances in technology and the complexity of their society which was able to coordinate large numbers of people with different roles for the purpose of building the monumental nuraghes giants grave in dorgali bronze age the nuraghes are not the only nuragic buildings that survive as there are several sacred wells around sardinia and other buildings that had religious purposes such as the giants grave monumental collective tombs and collections of religious buildings that probably served as destinations for pilgrimage and mass religious rites eg su romanzesu near bitti head of one of the socalled giants of monte prama sardinia was at the time at the centre of several commercial routes and it was an important provider of raw materials such as copper and lead which were pivotal for the manufacture of the time by controlling the extraction of these raw materials and by commercing them with other countries the nuragic civilisation was able to accumulate wealth and reach a level of sophistication that is not only reflected in the complexity of its surviving buildings but also in its artworks eg the votive bronze statuettes found across sardinia according to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with the sherden a tribe of the sea peoples the nuragic civilization was linked with other contemporaneous megalithic civilization of the western mediterranean such as the talaiotic culture of the balearic islands and the torrean civilization of south corsica evidence of trade with the other civilizations of the time is attested by several artefacts eg pots coming from as far as cyprus crete mainland greece spain and italy that have been found in nuragic sites bearing witness to the scope of commercial relations between the nuragic people and other peoples in europe and beyond ancient historyedit the phoenician and subsequently roman town of tharros necropolis of tuvixeddu cagliari around the th century bc the phoenicians began visiting sardinia with increasing frequency presumably initially needing safe overnight andor allweather anchorages along their trade routes from the coast of modernday lebanon as far afield as the african and european atlantic coasts and beyond the most common ports of call were caralis nora bithia sulci and tharros claudian a thcentury latin poet in his poem de bello gildonico stated that caralis was founded by people from tyre probably in the same time of the foundation of carthage in the th or th century bc in the th century bc after the conquest of western sicily the carthaginians planned to annex sardinia a first invasion attempt led by malco was foiled by the victorious nuraghic resistance however from  bc the southern and westcentral part of the island was invaded a second time and came under carthaginian rule roman thermae of forum traiani in what is now fordongianus in  bc taking advantage of carthage having to face a rebellion of her mercenaries the mercenary war after the first punic war – bc the romans annexed corsica and sardinia from the carthaginians the two islands became the province of corsica and sardinia they were not given a provincial governor until  bc the romans faced many rebellions and it took them many years to pacify both islands the existing coastal cities were enlarged and embellished and roman colonies such as turris lybissonis and feronia were founded these were populated by roman immigrants the roman military occupation brought the nuragic civilization to an end except for the mountainous interior of the island which the romans called barbaria meaning “barbarian land” roman rule in sardinia lasted  years during which time the province was an important source of grain for the capital latin came to be the dominant spoken language during this period though roman culture was slower to take hold and roman rule was often contested by the sardinian tribes from the mountainous regions vandal conquestedit a vandalperiod coin found in sardinia depicting godas latin legend  rex cvda the east germanic tribe of the vandals conquered sardinia in  their rule lasted for  years up to  when  eastern roman troops led by cyril one of the officers of the foederati retook the island it is known that the vandal government continued the forms of the existing roman imperial structure the governor of sardinia continued to be called the praeses and apparently continued to manage military judicial and civil governmental functions via imperial procedures the only vandal governor of sardinia about whom there is substantial record is the last godas a visigoth noble in ad  a coup détat in carthage removed king hilderic a convert to nicene christianity in favor of his cousin gelimer an arian christian like most of the élite in his kingdom godas was sent to take charge and ensure the loyalty of sardinia he did the exact opposite declaring the islands independence from carthage and opening negotiations with emperor justinian i who had declared war on hilderics behalf in ad  gelimer sent the bulk of his army and navy  vessels and  men to sardinia to subdue godas with the catastrophic result that the vandal kingdom was overwhelmed when justinians own army under belisarius arrived at carthage in their absence the vandal kingdom ended and sardinia was returned to roman rule byzantine era and the rise of the giudicatiedit in  sardinia returned to the rule of the byzantine empire when the vandals were defeated by the armies of justinian i under the general belisarius in the battle of tricamarum in their african kingdom belisarius sent his general cyril to sardinia to retake the island sardinia remained in byzantine hands for the next  years aside from a short period in which it was invaded by the ostrogoths in  under byzantine rule the island was divided into districts called mereíai μερείαι in byzantine greek which were governed by a judge residing in caralis and garrisoned by an army stationed in forum traiani today fordongianus under the command of a dux during this time christianity took deeper root on the island supplanting the paganism which had survived into the early middle ages in the culturally conservative hinterlands along with lay christianity the followers of monastic figures such as basil of caesarea became established in sardinia while christianity penetrated the majority of the population the region of barbagia remained largely pagan and probably partially nonlatin speaking they reestablished a shortlived independent domain with sardinianheathen lay and religious traditions one of its kings being hospito pope gregory i wrote a letter to hospito defining him dux barbaricinorum and being christian the leader and best of his people in this unique letter about hospito the pope prompts him to convert his people who “living all like irrational animals ignore the true god and worship wood and stone” barbaricini omnes ut insensata animalia vivant deum verum nesciant ligna autem et lapides adorent santa sabina byzantine church and nuraghe in silanus the dates and circumstances of the end of byzantine rule in sardinia are not known direct central control was maintained at least through c  after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of gregory the patrician exarch of africa and the first invasion of the muslim conquest of the maghreb there is some evidence that senior byzantine administration in the exarchate of africa retreated to caralis following the final fall of carthage to the arabs in  the loss of imperial control in africa led to escalating raids by moors and berbers on the island the first of which is documented in  forcing increased military selfreliance in the province communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the muslim conquest of sicily between  and  a letter by pope nicholas i as early as  mentions the sardinian judges without reference to the empire and a letter by pope john viii reigned – refers to them as principes princes by the time of de administrando imperio completed in  the byzantine authorities no longer listed sardinia as an imperial province suggesting they considered it lost in all likelihood a local noble family acceded to the power still identifying themselves as vassals of the byzantines but de facto independent as communications with constantinople were very difficult we know only two names of those rulers salusios σαλούσιος and the protospatharios turcoturios tουρκοτούριος from two inscriptions who probably reigned between the th and the th century these rulers were still closely linked to the byzantines both for a pact of ancient vassalage and from the ideological point of view with the use of the greek language in a country of the romance language and the use of art of byzantine inspiration the medieval basilica of san gavino in porto torres th century frescoes in the basilica di saccargia in codrongianos in the early th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by muslims based in spain the only records of that war are from pisan and genoese chronicles the christians won but after that the previous sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four small giudicati cagliari calari arborea arbaree gallura torres or logudoro whether this final transformation from imperial civil servant to independent sovereign resulted from imperial abandonment or local assertion by the th century the giudici sardinian judikes  latin iudices literally judges a byzantine administrative title had emerged as the autonomous rulers of sardinia the title of iudice changed with the language and local understanding of the position becoming the sardinian judike essentially a king or sovereign while giudicato sardinian judicadu literally ‘judgeship’ or ‘judicature’ came to mean state a letter by mieszko i of poland to pope john xv proves that the giudicati were known even in poland and that they played an important role in medieval europe early medieval sardinian political institutions evolved from the millennium old roman imperial structures with relatively little germanic influence although the giudicati were hereditary lordships the old byzantine imperial notion that personal title or honor was separate from the state still remained so the giudicato was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later european feudalism like the imperial systems the new order also preserved semidemocratic forms with national assemblies called the crown of the realm each giudicato saw to its own defense maintained its own laws and administration and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs the history of the four giudicati would be defined by the contest for influence between the rival rising sea powers of genoa and pisa and later the ambitions of the kingdom of aragon sardinian giudicati the giudicato of cagliari or pluminos during the regency of torchitorio v of cagliari and his successor william iii was allied with the republic of genoa for this it was brought to an end in  when its capital santa igia was stormed and destroyed by an alliance of sardinian and pisan forces the territory then was divided between republic of pisa the della gherardesca family and the giudicati of arborea and gallura pisa maintained the control over the fortress of castel di cagliari founded by pisan merchants in  east of santa igia in the southwest the count ugolino della gherardesca promoted the birth of the town of villa di chiesa today iglesias to exploit the nearby rich silver deposits the giudicato of logudoro sometimes called torres was also allied to the republic of genoa and came to an end in  after the death of the judikessa queen adelasia the territory was divided up between the doria and malaspina families of genoa and the basserra family of arborea while the city of sassari became a small republic like the italian citystates comuni confederated firstly with pisa and then with genoa the giudicato of gallura ended in the year  when the last giudice nino visconti a friend of dante alighieri was driven out by the pisans who occupied the territory the giudicato of arborea having oristano as its capital had a longer life compared to the other kingdoms its later history is entwined with the attempt to unify the island into a single sardinian state republica sardisca against their relatives and former aragonese allies aragonese periodedit in  pope boniface viii established on his own initiative motu proprio a hypothetical regnum sardiniae et corsicae kingdom of sardinia and corsica in order to settle the war of the sicilian vespers diplomatically this had broken out in  between the capetian house of anjou and catalans over the possession of sicily despite the existence of the indigenous states the pope offered this newly created crown to james ii of aragon promising him support should he wish to conquer pisan sardinia in exchange for sicily the proclamation of the republic of sassari the sassarese republic lasted from  until  when it sided with the new born kingdom of sardinia in  in alliance with the kingdom of arborea and following a military campaign that lasted a year or so the aragon crown prince alfonso led a catalan army that occupied the pisan territories of cagliari and gallura along with the allied city of sassari naming them the kingdom of sardinia and corsica the kingdom was to remain a dominion of the crown of aragon under the kings of spain until the treaty of utrecht during this period the giudicato of arborea promulgated the legal code of the kingdom in the carta de logu ‘charter of the land’ the carta de logu was originally compiled by marianus iv of arborea and was amended and updated by marianos daughter female judge judikessa or juighissa eleanor of arborea the legal code was written in sardinian and established a whole range of citizens rights among the revolutionary concepts in this carta de logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property in terms of civil liberties the code made provincial th century sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of europe in  peter iv of aragon following aragonese customs granted a parliament to the kingdom of sardinia and corsica which was followed by some degree of selfgovernment under a viceroy and judicial independence this parliament however had limited powers it consisted of highranking military commanders the clergy and the nobility the kingdom of aragon also introduced the feudal system into the areas of sardinia that it ruled the sardinian giudicati never adopted feudalism and arborea maintained its parliament called the corona de logu crown of the realm in this parliament apart from the nobles and military commanders also sat the representatives of each township and village the corona de logu exercised some control over the king under the rule of the bannus consensus the king could be deposed or even executed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom statue of judichessa eleanor of arborea in oristano broken the alliance with the crown of aragon from  to  the arborean giudici marianus iv hugh iii and brancaleone doria husband of eleanor of arborea succeeded in occupying all of sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the castle of cagliari and alghero which for years remained as the only aragonese dominions in sardinia in  martin i of sicily king of sicily and heir to the crown of aragon defeated the sardinians at the battle of sanluri the battle was fought by about  sardinian genoese and french knights enrolled from their kingdom at a time when the population of sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague despite the sardinian army outnumbering the aragonese army they were defeated the giudicato of arborea disappeared in  when its rights were sold by the last king for  gold florins and after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges for example leonardo cubello with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the kings of arborea was granted the title of marquis of oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the kingdom of arborea in exchange for his subjection to the aragonese monarchs the conquest of sardinia by the kingdom of aragon meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout sardinia thus sardinia is probably the only european country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the middle ages to the early modern period at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other european countries spanish periodedit flag of the kingdom of sardinia center at the funeral of charles i of spain in  the heir to sardinia ferdinand ii of aragon married isabel of castile and the kingdom of sardinia which was separated from corsica was to be

only with wild ferns and other weeds  during the terrible famine of  some  people out of a total population of  are said to have died and entire villages were devastated savoyard periodedit in  as a consequence of the spanish war of succession the rule of the kingdom of sardinia passed from king philip v of spain into the hands of the austrians who occupied the island the treaty of utrecht granted sardinia to the austrians but in  cardinal giulio alberoni minister of philip v of spain reoccupied sardinia in  with the treaty of london sardinia was handed over to the house of savoy that would impose the italian language on the island in  the french siege of cagliari and quartu in  sardinians repelled two french invasions on  february  domenico millelire commanding the sardinian fleet defeated the fleets of the french republic near the maddalena archipelago of which thenlieutenant napoleon bonaparte was a leader millelire became the first recipient of the gold medal of military valor of the italian armed forces in the same month sardinians stopped the attempted french landing on the beach of quartu santelena near the capital of cagliari because of these successes the representatives of nobility and clergy stamenti formulated five requests addressed to the king victor amadeus iii of sardinia but they got refused because of this discontent on  april  during an uprising in cagliari two savoyard officials were killed that was the start of a revolt called the sardinian vespers in the island which culminated on  april  commemorated today as sa die de sa sardigna with the expulsion or even execution of the piedmontese officers for a few days from the capital cagliari gm angioy entry into sassari on  december  in sassari insurgents demonstrating against feudalism mainly from the region of logudoro occupied the city on  february  in order to prevent the spread of the revolt the viceroy filippo vivalda gave the sardinian magistrate giovanni maria angioy the role of alternos which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself angioy moved from cagliari to sassari and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising demanding an end to feudalism and aiming to declare the island to be an independent republic but once he was outnumbered by loyalist forces he fled to paris and sought support for a french annexation of the island in  the islet near sardinia was attacked by the tunisians and over  inhabitants were taken away as slaves the final muslim attack on the island was on santantioco on  october  over a millennium since the first in  as a consequence of the napoleonic wars in italy the savoy royal family left turin and took refuge in cagliari for some fifteen years in  the sardinian parliaments stamenti in order to get the piedmontese liberal reforms they could not afford due to their separated legal system renounced their state autonomy and agreed to form a union with piedmont savoy nice and liguria in order to have a single parliament a single magistracy and a single government in turin this move aggravated the islands peripheral condition and most of the prounion supporters including its leader giovanni siotto pintor would later regret it sardinians wearing traditional clothing s in  the savoyards imposed the enclosures act editto delle chiudende on the island aimed at turning the lands traditional collective ownership a cultural and economic cornerstone of sardinia since the nuragic times to private property this gave rise to many abuses as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor sardinian farmers and shepherds who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land many local rebellions like the nuorese su connottu the already known in sardinian riot in  all repressed by the kings army resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land however the common lands called ademprivios were never completely abolished and they are still present in large number to this day  hectares of common lands were counted in  of which  constituted by woods in  the confederation of states powered by the savoyard kings of sardinia became a unitarian and constitutional state and moved to the italian wars of independence for the unification of italy that were led for thirteen years in  being italy united by a debated war campaign the parliament of the kingdom of sardinia decided by law to change its name and the title of its king in kingdom of italy and king of italy most sardinian forests were cut down at this time in order to provide the piedmontese with raw materials like wood used to make railway sleepers on the mainland the extension of the primary natural forests praised by every traveller visiting sardinia would in fact be reduced to  of their original number being little more than  hectares at the end of the century during the first world war the sardinian soldiers of the brigata sassari distinguished themselves it was the first and only regional military unit in italy since the people enrolled were only sardinians the regiment suffered heavy losses and earned four gold metals sardinia lost more young people than any other italian region on the front with  casualties per  soldiers compared to the italian average of  casualties during the fascist period with the implementation of the policy of autarky several swamps around the island were reclaimed and agrarian communities founded the main communities were the village of mussolinia now called arborea populated by farmers from veneto and friuli in the area of oristano and fertilia populated at first by settlers from the ferrara area followed after world war ii by a notable number of istrian italians and dalmatian italians hailing from territories lost to yugoslavia in the area adjacent the city of alghero within the region of nurra  also established during that time  was the city of carbonia which became the main centre of coal mining activity that attracted thousand of workers from the rest of the island and the italian mainland the sardinian writer grazia deledda won the nobel prize for literature in  effect of allied bombing on cagliari during the second world war during the second world war sardinia was an important air and naval base and was heavily bombed by the allies especially the city of cagliari german troops left the island on  september  a few days after the armistice of cassibile and retired to corsica without fighting and bloodshed after a bilateral

the italian economic miracle super yachts anchored at porto cervo port costa smeralda in the early s an industrialisation effort was commenced the socalled piani di rinascita rebirth plans with the initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island these included the construction of new dams and roads reforestation agricultural zones on reclaimed marshland and large industrial complexes primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations with the creation of petrochemical industries thousands of exfarmers became industrial workers the  oil crisis caused the termination of employment for thousands of workers employed in the petrochemical industries which aggravated the emigration already present in the s and s sardinia faced the creation of military bases on the island like decimomannu air base and salto di quirra the biggest scientific military base in europe in the same decades even now around  of all italian and nato military installations in italy are on sardinia whose area is less than onetenth of all the italian territory and whose population is little more than the  furthermore they comprise over  hectares used for experimental weapons testing where  of the military explosives in italy are used sardinian nationalism and local protest movements became stronger in the s and a number of bandits anonima sarda started a long series of kidnappings which ended only in the s this also gave rise to various militant groups that blended separatist and communist ideas the most famous being barbagia rossa and the sardinian armed movement which perpetrated several bombings and terrorist actions between the s and the s in the span of just two years –  bombing attacks were reported santo stefanos former nato naval base in  a prominent activist of a separatist party the sardinian action party partidu sardu – partito sardo dazione was elected president of the regional parliament and in the s several other movements calling for independence from italy were born in the s some of them became political parties even if in a rather disjointed manner it was not until  that the islands languages sardinian sassarese gallurese algherese and tabarchino were recognised even if just formally together with italian the th g summit was planned by prodi ii cabinet to be held in sardinia on the island of la maddalena in july  however in april  the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi decided without convoking the italian parliament or consulting the sardinian governor of his own party to move the summit even though the works were almost completed to laquila provoking heavy protests today sardinia is phasing in as an eu region with a diversified economy focused on tourism and the tertiary sector the economic efforts

closer to its latin roots than italian itself sardinian has been formally recognized as one of the twelve historical language minorities of italy since  by regional and italian law the language has been influenced by catalan spanish and recently italian while the once spoken nuragic contributes many features to it in many ancient remnants in  the regional administration has approved the use of a standardised writing system the socalled limba sarda comuna in official acts as a literary language sardinian is gaining importance despite heated debate about the lack of a commonly acknowledged standard orthography and controversial proposed solutions to this problem the two most widely spoken forms of the language are the southern dialects known as campidanese sardu campidanesu and the northern dialects known as logudorese sardu logudoresu extending almost to the suburbs of sassari the sardinian language is quite different from the other romance languages and is homogeneous in terms of morphology syntax and lexicon but it also shows a spectrum of variation in terms of phonetics between the northern and the southern dialects sassarese sassaresu and gallurese gadduresu are classified as corsosardinian languages therefore more akin to the italodalmatian branch than to the sardinian one and are spoken in the north in sardinia there are examples of language islands

the italian culture over the course of time the once prevalent indigenous languages have been increasingly losing ground to italian and the process of ongoing language shift has led to their extreme endangerment in fact according to the data published by istat in   of the sardinian population mainly speaks italian in the family environment while  alternates italian and sardinian and only  mainly

and cuisine posted august   the island region of sardinia offers up some of the most interesting and unique history in italy’s already culturally diverse repertoire from very early on sardinia has been a location of sustained and indeed thriving human settlement and the plants and animals nurtured there for centuries remain staples of the contemporary sardinian table cultural crossroads fabulous food  literally thousands of rare species of plants and animals grow and live on the island some entirely unique to sardinia an excellent example of the longevity of sardinia’s heirloom produce is the grenache wine grape ancient samples of which have been dated back to about  bc grenache grapes grown on the island today are genetically virtually indistinguishable from their ancestors grown thousands of years ago in the same areas the island’s geography gives some visual clues as to how influential other cultures have been in helping to shape sardinia’s own fascinating food culture over the course of the its invasionriddled history technically considered a mediterranean island sardinia’s eastern coast tickles the tyrrhenian sea farther to the east of which are the shores of mainland italy while unquestionably an italian region sardinia’s closest neighbor is actually the french island of corsica to its north on sardinia’s southern coast however the shores of algeria and tunisia are closer even than sardinia’s sister island region sicily add to this nexus of unusual geography the island’s long history of passing under the rule of the phoenicians romans vandals arabs and spanish just to name a few and it is nothing less than remarkable that the sardinians have been able to retain a quiet but fierce individuality they are one of only two groups of italian peoples recognized as poplo or “distinct people” carefully preserving even their own language – sardinian – elements of which predate the latin roots it shares with universal italian divided into the eight provinces of carboniaiglesias cagliari medio campidano ogliastra oristano nuoro sassari and olbia tempio sardinia is relatively large in comparison to most of the mainland regions each province is host to native cooking traditions informed by a complex confluence of deep italian heritage and transient but powerful foreign influences factor in the exceptionally fertile farmlands mountainous forests and the fine necklace of rich coastline and sardinia emerges as an island that might well be described as a rustic cook’s paradise  wild boar lean lamb suckling pork eggplants artichokes tomatoes lobsters sea urchins octopus clams mussels and squid abound salty “acquiredtaste” signature flavors have developed like those of bottarga pressed and salted mullet roe and the globally recognizable island namesake and mainstay sardines carta di musica or “sheet of music” a favorite paperthin crisp bread baked to a relatively dry state graces almost every table traditional hearty italian pastas like culingiones spinach and cheese raviolis share center stage with arabicinspired couscous dishes and many firsttime visitors are quite taken aback at sardinians’ liberal use of saffron the rare spice grows exceedingly well on the island saffron is a particular favorite in gnocchi dishes a wide variety of other herbs flourish on sardinia as well with the surprisingly menthol twang of aromatic yet bitter myrtle berries flowers leaves and wood flavoring many local dishes whether savory sweet used for wood smoking or instilled into digestive liqueurs myrtle is a mainstay of the sardinian palate cheeses hold special sway in sardinia being the island’s most exported food product pecorino sardo fiore sardo ricotta caprino pecorino romano and the famous casu marzu are all made within the region casu marzu which starts its life as a delightful local pecorino sardo cheese is actually illegal now in italy due to its bizarre additional culturing and aging process involving the introduction of live cheese fly larvae into the equation to bring about a potentially poisonous stage akin to decomposition though obviously a wildly risky gastronomic health adventure and definitely not for the timid of palate by any stretch of the imagination casu marzu is nonetheless a very popular black market commodity and is considered a distinctive delicacy by many locals if your tastes tend to less dangerous foods however there is thankfully a bounty of tamer and more universally delicious fare available from the sardinian table by combining some of the best and most quintessential flavors of italian tomatoes basil olives french cheeses crispy breads heavy cream and arabic cultures saffron chickpeas lamb your own meals can easily become sardinian feasts beyond
