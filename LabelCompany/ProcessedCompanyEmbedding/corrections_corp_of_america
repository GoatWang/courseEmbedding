slightly the release of the minutes from the most recent meeting of the federal open market committee didnt seem to unlock any secrets about the way the central bank intends to handle interest rates but the fact that there were multiple dissenting voices at the fed about keeping rates steady in september gave support to the idea that a rate increase will likely come later in the year even with the uncertainty that the fed minutes raised some stocks still gained ground and among the best performers were barracuda networks nysecuda corrections corp of america nysecxw and mueller water

stop using private prisons for their inmates however the results drops in the stock prices for corrections corp and its peers appeared to reflect a worstcase scenario in which federal and state governments dramatically cut their use of private prison services with the likelihood that things wont turn out that badly some analysts believe the stock is an attractive value right now mueller springs higher finally mueller water products rose  analysts at northcoast research raised their rating on the stock from neutral to buy and that heightened the bullish sentiment many investors have toward the stock mueller has been a pioneer in developing smart technology that water utilities can use in their distribution systems in order to maximize efficiency and minimize waste with features

over the past thirty years as of  around half of all prisoners in state facilities were there for nonviolent crimes and half of inmates in federal prisons were serving time for drugrelated offenses studies have shown that for many offenses incarceration has little if any impact on public safety and that time in prison actually increases a persons likelihood of committing more crimes according to the justice policy institute while private prison companies may try to present themselves as just meeting existing demand for prison beds and responding to current market conditions in fact they have worked hard over the past decade to create markets for their product although it claims that it has not lobbied for bills that extend or increase sentences for prisoners for nearly two decades cca

cca is the clear leader of private prisons controlling approximately  of the private corrections and detention beds in the united states cca provides housing and services under approximately  agreements with various federal state and local agencies the company also has a whollyowned subsidiary transcor america through which it profits from providing prisoner transportation services forprofit prison companies contract with federal and state governments to either take over management of a staterun facility or house people in a privately constructed prison in at least one case cca purchased a publiclyowned prison and converted it to private control and management private prisons generally charge a daily rate per person incarcerated to cover investment operating costs and turn a profit this daily rate varies depending on location bargaining leverage stipulations in the contracts for occupancy guarantees caps on medical care population and security level but usually pays for correctional officers support staff food services programmatic costs and partial medical care among other services founding cca was founded in  by tom beasley don hutto and doctor robert crants whose first name is doctor but who is not a physician or phd cca’s first contract in  was with the reagan administration’s immigration and naturalization service ins a federal agency that was subsequently reorganized to become part of the department of homeland security and its enforcement operations were renamed ice that contract was to house detained immigrants in texas the following year cca obtained a contract to manage a juvenile detention facility in its home state of tennessee and two years later cca opened the “shelby training center” the first privately owned and operated juvenile detention center in the us it also created the first privately owned women’s prison in new mexico in  see below for information about allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination by women staff members and prisoner abuse and sexual assault at ccas womens prisons profiting from more people behind bars were being robbed but the people doing it will never go to prison ccas business model rests on incarceration the more individuals locked up the more cca and its shareholders profit increases in ccas earnings and stock prices have corresponded with americas incarceration boom  and laws that criminalize a longer list of conduct and require that those convicted serve longer sentences are good for business according to the justice policy institute since private prison companies are in the business to make money policies that maintain or increase incarceration boost their revenues from a business perspective the economic and social costs of mass incarceration are externalities that aren’t figured into their corporate bottom line indeed the company has faced challenges in recent years as the public has slowly shifted away from a toughoncrime model cca has acknowledged in its k filings with the securities and exchange commission that its profitability may be hurt by new developments in criminal justice such as “the relaxation of enforcement efforts leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities” although cca has denied lobbying for criminal justice or sentencing laws ccas own contracts requiring a guaranteed occupancy rate for its prisons has a similar impact these bed guarantee clauses can encourage tough enforcement and sentencing policies or at a minimum can help deter reform ccas role in the american legislative exchange council alec which has advanced harsh sentencing measures has raised raised additional questions occupancy guarantees or quotas in cca contracts keep prisons full and profits up in january  cca sent a  million proposal to prison officials in  states offering to purchase their facilities  as long as the state promised to keep the facility ninety percent occupied over the duration of the  yearplus contract taxpayers would have to pay cca for any unused beds if the occupancy rate dipped below ninety percent at any time this was an effort by cca to duplicate its purchase in  of the bed lake erie correctional institution from the state of ohio for  million along with a ninety percent bed guarantee as discussed below the facility has had numerous operational problems since cca took control roger werholtz former kansas secretary of corrections told usa today that states may be tempted by the quick infusion of cash but it could warp public interest goals of reducing the prison population my concern would be that our state would be obligated to maintain these occupancy rates and subtle pressure would be applied to make sentencing laws more severe with a clear intent to drive up the population he said no states took cca up on its january  offer but many private prison operators have successfully inserted occupancy quota provisions into prison privatization contracts according to a report by in the public interest itpi over half of the state and local level contracts analyzed by itpi contained bed guarantee provisions the occupancy requirements were between  and  percent with many around  percent in addition to warping a states criminal justice goals these clauses can force corrections departments to pay thousands sometimes millions for unused beds the private prison industry often claims that prison privatization saves states money numerous studies and audits have shown these claims of cost savings to be illusory and bed occupancy requirements are one way that private prison companies lock in inflated costs after the contract is signed itpi wrote negotiating occupancy quotas after contracts are signed many of the occupancy quota clauses were not in the original contract but were instead added as an amendment after the initial contract was signed  which cca has identified as integral to revenue growth in its  annual report for example cca explicitly cites “enhancing the terms of our existing contracts” as one of the approaches its uses to develop its business colorado prison quotas findings from in the public interest sept   criminalhow lockup quotas and “lowcrime taxes” guarantee profits in some cases cca has inserted occupancy quotas outside of the contract process altogether in colorado for example cca negotiated a provision in the  budget guaranteeing that at least  prisoners would be housed in ccas three colorado facilities at an annual rate of  per inmate over the past decade colorados crime rate had dropped by a third and five prisons closed between  and   propelling cca to negotiate the deal behind closed doors with no public hearings the occupancy requirement not only ensured that cca continued to receive a guaranteed level of revenue each month despite the decrease in inmates but also had the effect of diverting inmates away from available public prison beds itpi wrote colorado originally intended its private prisons to be used for overflow purposes but the bed guarantee provisions allowed it to become the first priority for placement ohio prison quotas in  ohio sold its lake erie correctional institution to cca it was the firstever sale of a public prison to a private firm the year contract includes a  percent occupancy quota requiring that ohio  and its taxpayers  keep  of the  available beds occupied the situation is made worse by cca squeezing an additional  beds into the facility after the purchase violating minimum square footageperinmate requirements notably the head of ohios corrections department had served as a managing director of cca the aclu has noted after the sale a report on the lake erie institution from the correctional institution inspection committee ciic showed that violence gang activity and drug use was rampant in the facility assaults fights disturbances and uses of force have all increased in comparison to prior years the ciic report found echoing the findings of earlier reports on the facility additionally both because of poor conditions within the prison and costcutting measures by cca there is extremely high turnover among staff making conditions worse approximately onefifth of personnel are leaving within the course of a year see this timeline from the aclu documenting the declining conditions at the lake erie correctional institution after it was purchased by cca ties to the american legislative exchange council cca was a member of the american legislative exchange council alec for over two decades and reportedly left the organization in  while cca was an alec member alec pushed legislation to privatize prisons and at the same time advanced harsh sentencing bills to put more people in prison for more time time particularly truthinsentencing legislation calling for all violent offenders to serve  percent of their sentences before being eligible for release and three strikes youre out bills requiring mandatory life imprisonment for a third felony conviction these bills became law in a majority of states during the s and early s laurie shanblum ccas senior director of partnership development was the corporate chair of the public safety and elections task force during portions of the midtolate s and was listed as a member of the task forces executive committee circa july  shanblum was also on that task forces homeland security subcommittee during the same time period about alec alec is a corporate bill mill it is not just a lobby or a front group it is much more powerful than that through alec corporations hand state legislators their wishlists to benefit their bottom line corporations fund almost all of alecs operations they pay for a seat on alec task

years the national rifle association nra another task force member and the current task force cochair initiated a campaign to introduce two pieces of alecinspired legislation at the state and federal level the socalled truthinsentencing and threestrikesyoureout laws truthinsentencing called for all violent offenders to serve  percent of their sentences before being eligible for release three strikes called for mandatory life imprisonment for a third felony conviction the nra campaign dubbed crimestrike was seen by many as a reaction to the clinton administrations efforts to pass gun control crimestrike set forth the precept that guns dont kill people people kill people and derided any legislator backing gun control as being soft on crime with memories of the willie horton disaster of the failed  michael dukakis presidential campaign still on the minds of lawmakers this accusation hit a nerve and elicited kneejerk support of the laws by democrats an alecnra crimestrike report from  can be viewed here in addition to calling for tough sentencing laws the report demands the legal authority for the states and localities to privatize prisons jails and other detention

wi governor scott walker an american radio works report from  analyzing the connections between alec harsh sentencing laws and cca discussed a case study in wisconsin in wisconsin a group of lawmakers led passage of truthinsentencing in  many of us myself included were part of alec says the bills author then republican state representative scott walker clearly alec had proposed model legislation walker recalls and probably more important than just the model legislation alec had actually put together reports and such that showed the benefits of truthinsentencing and showed the successes in other states and those sorts of statistics were very helpful to us when we pushed it through when we passed the final legislation but a former head of wisconsins prison system walter dickey  now a university of wisconsin law professor  says he finds it shocking that lawmakers would write sentencing policy with help from alec a group that gets funding and supposedly expertise from a private prison corporation i dont know that they know anything about sentencing dickey says they know how to build prisons presumably since thats the business theyre in they dont know anything about probation and parole they dont know about the development of alternatives they dont know about how public safety might be created and defended in communities in this state and other states as a legislator walker also promoted prison privatization in the state albeit unsuccessfully the wisconsin state legislature apparently recognized the folly of truth in sentencing and rolled back aspects of the law between  and  when scott walker became governor in  however he reversed this progress and pushed for legislation fully restoring the alec corporatesupported truth in sentencing despite the costs to taxpayers and despite claiming wisconsin was broke in early july  governor walkers office released a statement supporting expanded use of prison labor another idea promoted in alec bills some observers speculated that private prisons would be next see this graphic from american radio works explaining the ccaalecwisconsin sentencing law connection connections to the alecarizona sb antiimmigrant law arizona state senator russell pearce in  arizona state senator russell pearce rmesa the alec state chair for arizona brought the no sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants act  later to become known as sb   to alec for adoption as a model bill at the time cca was an executive member of alecs public safety and elections task force as was sen pearce lobbyists for cca and other private prison industries were in the room when the bill was adopted as a model while cca stood to profit from increased immigration enforcement and detention it denies it had any role in crafting the bill a few months later pearce introduced the alec no sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants act as senate bill  sb  and it quickly passed the legislature and was signed into law by governor jan brewer an alec alumni  of the bill’s  cosponsors promptly received campaign contributions from the forprofit prison industry a little over a week after pearce introduced sb  cca enlisted highground consulting one of the most influential lobbying firms in phoenix to represent its interests in the state in addition governor jan brewers spokesperson had previously worked as ccas chief lobbyist in arizona during his time at the policy development group cca also made other hiring decisions to increase its influence in arizona prior to the bills introduction for example brad regans cca vice president of state partnership relations was formerly the director of fiscal policy in the arizona house and former arizona senator dennis deconcini was selected to be a member of the board of directors for cca in  much of sb  was struck down by the supreme court in the case arizona v united states  us   immigrant detention is ccas new profit center immigrants for sale state prison populations have been declining in recent years but federal numbers have increased  thanks in no small part to a rise in immigration detention in  cca derived  percent of its revenue from federal contracts from  to  the number of people locked up in the us shot up by  percent according to an aclu report between  and  the number of prisoners behind private prison bars expanded significantly from  to  inmates an increase of  percent cca along with other private prison companies were on the brink of financial collapse in the s following widespread stories of escapes inmate violence and deplorable conditions in their facilities not to mention declining crime rates speculative prison building and other factors ccas stock had lost  percent of its value in the year  the company and the industry as a whole rebounded in the early s following a massive increase in the amount of illegal immigrant detentions in the wake of  which created a whole new market for its facilities from  to  cca revenue increased  percent and they managed to receive at least  billion in revenue for each of the eight years from  to  the huffington post reports because of punitive drug laws drug offenders still make up more than  percent of the federal prison system according to the department of justice immigrants are the thirdhighest category of offenders at  percent but this year more than  percent of all federal criminal convictions have been for immigrationrelated crimes federal data show in the wake of september   the george w bush administration began a zerotolerance policy known as operation streamline  arresting and detaining people at the border no longer were immigrants deported relatively rapidly or put into a civil detention center this led to a fourfold increase in immigration cases from the previous decade as research from syracuse universitys transactional records access clearinghouse showed in  this is the crime du jour states justice strategies director judith greene its the drug war all over again its whats driving the market in federal prisons this resulted in significant windfall for private companies such as cca and geo group  million for cca came from federal contracts with the bureau of prisons and the us marshals service in   million was pocketed by geo in   percent of its revenue from both agencies although forprofit prison companies like cca and geo group have denied lobbying to influence immigration policy the evidence suggests otherwise for example an analysis by the associated press in  found that the three major private prison corporations  cca the geo group and another smaller company  spent roughly  million over the past decade on campaign donations and lobbyists the private prison corporations specifically target republican legislators over immigration reform the companies success in lobbying echoed their harnessing the zeitgeists of the preceding decades from tough on crime in the s and s and terrorisminduced blowback to immigration in the early st century hedging bets and investing in correctional alternatives as state and federal authorities move away from incarcerationfocused responses to crime cca has begun acquiring companies that offer alternatives to incarceration in august of  for example cca acquired correctional alternatives inc a company that focuses on community corrections and reentry programs for  million cost cutting leads to violence abuse and death one of the most common critiques of private prisons is that the industrys goals of maximizing profits are at odds with the traditional goals of the criminal justice system such as offender rehabilitation reducing recidivism rates increasing public safety and lowering crime rates in addition to making more profits when more people are behind bars ccas costcutting measures have led to an extensive record of inmateoninmate and guardoninmate and viceversa violence which are many times a result of inadequate training low pay and high turnover of corrections staff as well as chronic understaffing further allegations of civil rights abuses and medical neglect have resulted in individual and classaction lawsuits brought against the company for example a spreadsheet of lawsuits complied by private corrections working groupprivate corrections institute lists  lawsuits filed against cca that were settled before trial these suits range from employment discrimination to inmate abuse allegations and were filed between  to  prisoner abuse violence riots and escapes in cca facilities according to numerous reports incidence of violence is on average significantly higher in private prisons than in publiclymanaged prisons for example in  the private corrections institute pci obtained data from the tennessee department of correction todc revealing that incident rates involving assaults and disturbances at ccarun prisons were consistently higher than at publiclyoperated prisons in tennessee from january  to june  pci reports in terms of rates per  prisoner population the privatelyoperated prisons had notably higher incident rates for  the average rate of incidents at the  staterun prisons was  per  population while the average rate at the three cca facilities was    higher than at tdoc prisons the  average rate of incidents at tdoc facilities was  per  population and the average rate at the cca prisons was    higher than at the state operated facilities during the first six months of  the average rate of incidents at tdoc prisons was  per  population while the average rate at the cca facilities was    higher than at the tdoc prisons many of these problems can be attributed to high employee turnover inadequate training for officers understaffing and miserable conditions experienced by the inmate population below are just a few examples of lawsuits and complaints alleging prisoner abuse and sexual assault the withholding of medical care resulting in death and negligently allowing violence riots and escapes in ccarun facilities violence riots and escapes resulting in injury or death fightcorrections corporation of america ccarun idaho gladiator school  the ccaoperated idaho correctional center icc had experienced egregious levels of violence earning itself the nickname the gladiator school the idaho department of correction determined in a  study that the icc had “four times more prisoneron prisoner assaults than idaho’s other seven publiclyoperated prisons combined” cca employees were alleged to have been complicit in the violence using violence as a management tool and failing to protect vulnerable prisoners from predatory inmates a complaint filed by the aclu alleges icc is an extraordinarily violent prison it is known in idaho as gladiator school for a reason more violence occurs at icc than at idahos eight other prisons combined and the unnecessary carnage and suffering that has resulted is shameful and inexcusable icc not only condones prisoner violence the entrenched culture of icc promotes facilitates and encourages it indeed icc staff cruelly use prisoner violence as a management tool additionally videos released to the press showing inmateoninmate violence prompted an fbi investigation into the ccarun facility court documents unsealed in august  showed that the violence was partially attributable to cca understaffing the facility even after a settlement requiring that they hire more guards cca falsified at least  staff hours filing reports with the state showing that security posts were filled when they were actually vacant the aclu estimates that the total could be as high as  falsified staff hours the idaho department of corrections is investigating how many hours have been understaffed in recent years and the idaho state police are investigating whether cca committed any crimes by making the false statements  the lawsuit was settled in september  but approximately one year later the aclu said cca was violating the settlement which required staffing and safety changes at the prison the associated press reported in november  the separate lawsuit filed by a group of eight inmates late last week echoed allegations made in the aclu case with the inmates saying cca is working with a few powerful prison gangs to control the facility the eight inmates also allege that cca has violated the settlement with the aclu by engaging in a ‘persistent pattern of misconduct in september  a federal court found cca in contempt of court for failing to comply with the settlement agreement and lying about its staffing levels us district judge david carter issued a scathing page ruling warning that he would make the fines as high as necessary to force compliance  if a prospective fine leads to  million in penalties cca has no one to blame but itself carter wrote according to judge carters order any mandatory security post left unstaffed for more than  hours in a month will bring fines of  an hour with the judge warning he would raise the fine to  an hour or higher if the situation does not change idaho cancelled its contract with cca in  yearold cca corrections officer dies in missouri prison riot in may  the family of slain officer catlin carithers filed a lawsuit alleging that officer carithers was on a hit list and that cca was negligent in preventing his death the complaint alleges that the

further alleges that cca knew this and did not increase staff at the facility modify the treatment of the inmates or resolve the dangerous atmosphere experienced by the correction officers cca settles prison riot suit in colorado for  hundreds of prisoners alleged in a lawsuit that cca instigated and mishandled a prison riot in  used excessive force during and after the riot and continued to mistreat prisoners afterwards the plaintiffs attorneys say that frightened inmates had warned cca guards for days that inmates transferred to the colorado prison from washington state were planning a riot because they were angry about being moved far away from their families additionally a report from the colorado department of corrections later showed that the cca facility was plagued by high

ice in texas the alleged attacks involved detainees who were being transported from the t don hutto family residential center in taylor texas the lawsuit names as defendants three ice officials williamson county texas corrections corporation of america cca the manager of the hutto facility the former facility administrator and a guard the lawsuit alleges that the officer sexually assaulted each of the women and is known to have assaulted at least six others between october   and may   when he transported them from the hutto facility to either the airport or the greyhound bus station after they were released from detention it further alleges that this officer had the opportunity to assault these women because cca repeatedly violated its intergovernmental service contract with the county by allowing male officers to transport female detainees without the presence of another officer much less a female officer the lawsuit states that the victimized women all of whom had fled their home countries to escape extreme violence and who were agonized and vulnerable from their journeys and from the disgusting conditions they experienced in holding cells and detention centers in the united states were of necessity severely traumatized by these assaults and the defendants both individually and collectively were directly responsible for the assaults and the resulting trauma in

obtained only in day lots since mr buller was scheduled to be released on or about may   cca did not want to pay for a day supply of the medication and cca did not wish to incur the additional cost of approximately  for the winstrol they would have had to order when mr buller was only going to be at the facility for another ten days costcutting in the medical department had become a major concern for cca on the day mr buller died he tried to call for help from his cell but as much as  minutes passed before cca staff arrived to help the complaint also alleges that unit staff had the practice of turning on the intercom in an empty cell in order to cut off calls from inmates in occupied cells thereby preventing inmates in occupied cells from ‘bothering unit staff with calls the lawsuit was

discrimination attention cashstrapped states  the largest forprofit prison a deal for you the cost savings claimed by the forprofit prison industry is generally achieved at the expense of its workforce by slashing wages and benefits for correctional staff in fact cca boasts in its sec filings that its business model helps state governments by allowing them to avoid longterm pension obligations for their employees there is also evidence that the cca has engaged in chronic understaffing falsified staffing records and violated the fair labor standards act flsa by refusing to pay overtime for example when cca ran the otter creek prison in kentucky the state ended its contract in  the pay there was extremely low even by local standards in  the governmentrun federal prison in kentucky paid workers with no experience at least  an hour and nearby staterun prisons paid  while the ccarun otter creek paid only  also in  it was reported that in arizona cca paid correctional officers only  to  an hour while correctional officers in arizona state prisons earned  to  an hour below are just a few examples of lawsuits alleging ccas failure to pay employees overtime or pay for hours worked in general as well as allegations of sexual harassment discrimination and antiunion activity fair labor standards act violations in order to keep profits up and costs down cca has allegedly engaged in a pattern of requiring nonexempt employees employees who must be paid overtime for work over  hours in any week to work offtheclock thereby denying them pay for work performed and overtime pay in violation of the flsa the company settled a suit in  but may not have learned its lesson because another suit was filed in  alleging similar violations cca settles class action lawsuit

flsa violations the complaint alleged that cca did not pay employees for work they performed before or after their scheduled shifts and denied them overtime pay cca settled the case agreeing to pay

opportunity commission press release among the allegations in the court record are the following a female officer made a complaint of sexual harassment against a male coworker and was then placed in an isolated location where she was raped by the man about whom she had complained the chief of security forced a female corrections officer to have intercourse with him which she did in order to keep

racially hostile work environment and claiming they were retaliated against for trying to report unsafe working conditions and other problems at the jail national labor relations act violations and antiunion activities there is evidence that cca has engaged in antiunion activities and committed unfair labor practices ulp in violation of the national labor relations act nlra in  the nlrb issued a decision finding that cca interfered with protected concerted activity in violation of the nlra by initiating a drive to decertify the union international union security police and fire professionals of north america spfpa and then coercing and threatening its employees to support the decertification drive the board also upheld the finding that the company violated the nlra by unlawfully transferring an officer to a less desirable position and unlawfully discharging another officer because of those individuals union activities also in  the nlrb reversed an earlier decision holding that cca unlawfully discharged an employee in retaliation for protected union activity in violation of the nlra cca cuts costs but taxpayers dont see the savings according to the aclu while supporters of privatization tout the idea that governments can save money through private facilities the evidence for supposed cost savings is mixed at best as state governments across the nation confront deep fiscal deficits the assertion that private prisons demonstrably reduce the costs of incarceration can be dangerous and irresponsible such claims may lure states into building private prisons or privatizing existing ones rather than reducing incarceration rates and limiting corrections spending through serious criminal justice reform instances of government fraud and tax evasion in other attempts to cut costs cca has been caught falsifying staffing records engaging in medicaid fraud and creatively dodging taxes cca employees in idaho falsify staffing records on top of the many problems at the ccarun idaho correctional center known as the gladiator school violence misconduct by guards fbi and state police investigations the company admitted that its employees had falsified nearly  hours of staffing records cca charged the state for thousands of staffing hours where security positions were actually vacant the company placed the blame on its employees stating we will take appropriate disciplinary action with the involved personnel and we will work to enhance the staffing training and record keeping processes at the facility however a separate lawsuit filed in november  alleges that the company falsified staff logs to hide chronic understaffing this understaffing reportedly contributed to the unsafe conditions in the facility cca settles charges of medicaid fraud in florida the attorney generals medicaid fraud control unit in florida found that between january  and may  corrections corporation of america cca submitted fraudulent claims to the state of florida medicaid program in violation of the florida false claims act the ag found that cca which provides health care services to inmates at facilities throughout florida improperly billed medicaid for

penalty cca pays  million to settle  irs auditin october  cca entered into a settlement agreement with the internal revenue service in connection with the irs’s audit of a  federal income tax return filed by cca’s corporate predecessor under the terms of the settlement cca paid approximately  million tax avoidance cca transformed itself into a real estate investment trust reit in  designed to reduce the payment of corporate federal income taxes reits are a special tax designation for companies that focus on real estate holdings cca was able to make the successful claim to the internal revenue service that the money they collect from government entities for holding prisoners is essentially the same as rent collection explains a report from grassroots leadership ccas chief executive damon t hininger said the good news about this is that we are going to be able to enjoy a full year of tax savings for  in the first quarter of  the firm realized a  million income tax benefit related to the companys recent conversion into a reit grassroots leadership notes that at a time of drastic budget cuts throughout the public sector cca expects to make  million savings in tax payments for  due to its reit status cca had tried an reit in the past with disastrous results as prison legal news explains cca formed prison realty trust and a separate operating company but due to various factors including poor management decisions the reit defaulted on its debt and the companys stock dropped to under  a share putting it at risk of being delisted from the new york stock exchange cca subsequently reversed its reit conversion and faced shareholder lawsuits that alleged various corporate officers and directors had concealed information and made false and misleading statements the suits were eventually settled for approximately  million in stock and cash separately in new mexico in  cca sought a tax exemption from state city and local governments for payments it receives from the federal government for federal inmates held in facilities inside new mexico cca eventually negotiated an exemption only from state taxes while agreeing to taxes on the local level states end relationships with cca kentucky kentucky had housed prisoners in private prisons for approximately  years including three ccarun facilities but decided not to renew its last contract with cca in  hawaii after two lawsuits for inmate deaths and allegations of prisoner abuse hawaii stated its intention to bring prisoners back to the islands but in  the state signed a new threeyear deal with cca in arizona however the contract was signed as governor neil abercrombies administration was reportedly making plans to end the states longstanding policy of imprisoning hawaiian inmates in outofstate facilities in  hawaii had decided to bring female prisoners back from a cca prison in kentucky over sexual abuse charges idaho after lawsuits violence and falsifying records idaho ended its contract with cca for the operation of idaho correctional center icc texas in  the texas department of criminal justice announced that two ccaoperated facilities would close dawson state jail and mineral wells preparole transfer facility grassroots leadership along with its ally organizations had advocated for the closure of the dawson state jail after the deaths of three incarcerated women and the death of

include vanguard group barclays global investors blackrock bank of new york mellon credit suisse ag morgan stanley and more damon t hininger ceo of cca is a major stockholder with over  shares for more on investors see ray downs who is getting rich off the prison industrial complex vice june  political activity lobbying since private prisons make money from putting people behind bars their lobbying efforts focus on bills that affect incarceration and law enforcementsuch as appropriations for corrections and detention the justice policy institute notes knowing that private prison companies bring in revenue from holding people in prison it is likely that their lobbying efforts contribute to promoting the current approach to incarceration and decrease the impetus for reform cca and its hired lobbying firms have spent about  million lobbying congress and federal agencies from  to august  according to the center for responsive politics crp at the state level the company has hired  lobbyists in  states from  to  according to the national institute on money in state politics while additional firms have been used previously from  to  cca exclusively hired three outside lobbying firms for its federal lobbying in addition to their inhouse lobbyists these firms include mcbee strategic consulting mehlman vogel castagnetti inc and akin gump et al during this time as well as in  and  the companys total federal lobbying expenses were around  million per year this was a decline from the years  to  when lobbying expenditures were between  and  million per year although  and  were the two years of highest lobbying expenses  was the third largest spending year largely because of the seven bills cca lobbied for or against that year the bill with the most reports hr  known as the private prison information act of  would have required private prisons to be subject to foia requests just as federal prisons and correctional facilities are cca vehemently opposed the bill that and all similar bills have either died in or before subcommittee hearings according to forprofit prison scholar christopher petrella cca and its hired firms also lobbied heavily against another bill to end the use of private prisons for incarcerating inmates hr  or the public safety act in the first half of  cca and its hired firms spent  on lobbying at the federal level employing  lobbyists  percent of whom have revolving door connections beyond bills directly impacting the private prison system cca has a possible stake in possible immigration reform when new pathways to citizenship could disrupt the number of people detained in private prisons for their immigration status a cca spokesperson denied the companys involvement in immigration reform to the nation in february  but lobbying reports show its efforts regarding border security bills in  such as the border security act and appropriations bills for the department of homeland security in  cca reported lobbying on bills related to funding for homeland security and immigration and customs enforcement the nation wrote of ccas likely interests regarding immigration reform on the one hand a pathway to citizenship and legal reforms sought by advocates could reduce the number of immigrants detained by cca and its competitors in the private prison industry private prison corporations have an enormous stake in immigration reform says bob libal a prison reform advocate with grassroots leadership a reform that provides a timely pathway to citizenship without further criminalizing migration would be a huge hit to the industry he says grassroots leadership also discussed the actions of ccas inhouse lobbyists on the department of homeland security appropriations bills bart velhulst jeremy wiley and kelli cheever ccas inhouse lobbyists were paid  in  and  in  they lobbied on the department of homeland security appropriations bill particularly on provisions related to ice detention as well as the house of representatives and the senate on homeland security issues related to the private prison industry at least as recently as  cca was a member of the american legislative exchange council alec which has not only promoted model legislation to privatize prisons but also to put more people in prison through harsh sentencing laws and statebased antiimmigrant legislation read more in the ties to the american legislative exchange council section political contributions state spending cca and its employees contributed  million in  states from  to  with contributions concentrated in california florida georgia tennessee and idaho according to the national institute on money in state politics federal spending in addition to its extensive federal lobbying efforts cca has a pac to disburse donations to federal candidates from  to july  the cca pac contributed  million to various federal candidates according to crp the majority of ccas contributions have generally gone to republican candidates though democratic candidates have received over  from cca since  in  the companys political action committee spent  with  percent of the pacs contributions in federal races going to republican candidates according to crp in  a landmark year for extraordinary amounts of campaign money the pacs largest contribution went to kevin mccarthy rca a longtime advocate of the private sector despite the extraordinary levels of election dollars spent in  the pacs largest contributions occurred during the  elections with its largest donation being to sen mike dewine roh an incumbent who struggled against fellow gop challengers when dewine tried to dub himself as an independent in  dewine had helped cca acquire a federal contract to operate a prison in youngstown ohio  a facility which had been closed down in  after dangerous conditions including  stabbings and  murders came to light many political contributions from  onward from the pac or from cca individuals have largely gone to candidates from tennessee texas ohio and georgia according to crp cca says its political contributions are an essential way for them to get involved in the political process and assert their agenda at cca we believe that participation process is an important and appropriate part of our partnership relations efforts we must education federal state and local officials on the benefits of partnership corrections ccas ability to assist them in meeting their corrections needs and our track record of success according to crp the top recipients of contributions from cca in  as of august

ferguson served as commissioner of finance and administration for the state of tennessee donna alvarado holds several appointments in ohio government related to higher education and economic policy thurgood marshall jr was a cabinet secretary under president bill clinton according to the justice policy institute other examples include maine governor paul lepage appointed former cca warden joe ponte as the commissioner of the maine department of corrections while maine currently does not have any private prisons according to news reports cca has been in discussions with the town of milo for the past  years over the possibility of building a  million facility the appointment of ponte and the  in campaign contributions lepage received from cca raise concerns of increased access for cca to open private prisons in maine after serving  years in the us house of representatives john kasich retired in  and took a managing director position in ohio with lehman brothers lehman brothers has a long standing history with private prison companies spending most of the late s and s before their collapse underwriting bonds and managing credit for both cca and cornell after winning the

rounding out kasich’s connections to cca is his close friend and former congressional chief of staff whose lobbying firm was hired to represent cca in january  in  president george w bush nominated ccas general counsel gustavus puryear iv to a lifetime appointment on the us district court for the middle district of tennessee alex friedmann currently of prison legal news organized a campaign to prevent his appointment beyond the concern that general counsel of cca would be serving as judge in a district where cca headquarters is also located puryear did not have the qualifications to hold the position among the most prominent issues puryear lacked litigation and trial experience received a comparatively low rating in the american bar association‟s review of judicial nominees had close personal and professional ties to vice president dick cheney and was involved in representation of people involved in the case of a suspicious death of a woman held in a cca facility in addition to compiling information about puryear for the senate judiciary committee tasked with approving the appointment friedmann also organized other organizations including alliance for justice grassroots leadership and the american federation of state county and municipal employees among others to oppose his nomination on january   the nomination was returned to the white house effectively denying puryear the appointment risk factors in sec filings below is a list of some of the more notable risk factors cca lists in its  form k annual report we are subject to fluctuations in occupancy levels and a decrease in occupancy levels could cause a decrease in revenues and profitability p  the operation of correctional and detention facilities by private entities has not achieved complete acceptance by either governments or the public p  the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has also encountered resistance from certain groups such as labor unions and others that believe that correctional and detention facilities should only be operated by governmental agencies p  the demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws p  for instance any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested convicted and sentenced thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them    our policy prohibits us from engaging in lobbying or advocacy efforts that would influence enforcement efforts parole standards criminal laws and sentencing policies p  the return of the california inmates to the state of california would have a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows p  history

correctional association aca has accredited  of ccas facilities acas accreditation is a system of verification that correctional agencies and facilities comply with national standards promulgated by the american correctional association accreditation is achieved through a series of reviews evaluations audits and hearings on august   deputy us attorney general sally yates announced that the justice department intended to end its bureau of prisons contracts with forprofit prison operators because its own analysis concluded the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services than the federal bureau of prisons in a memorandum yates continued forprofit prisons served an important role during a difficult period but time has shown that they compare poorly to our own bureau facilities they simply do not provide the same level of correctional services programs and resources they do not save substantially on costs and as noted in a recent report by the departments office of inspector general they do not maintain the same level of safety and security the rehabilitative services that the bureau provides such as educational programs and job training have proved difficult to replicate and outsource and these services are essential to reducing recidivism and improving public safety inmate rehabilitationedit the united states prison system provides reentry and rehabilitation programs for inmates such programs often include education vocational training addiction treatment as well as faithbased programs in addition to the reentry and rehabilitation programs prisons often offer inmates recreational and optional faithbased opportunities the latter is considered an integral part of inmate rehabilitation cca says it offers basic adult education postsecondary education gre preparation and testing and literacy programs to all inmates the department of justices bureau of justice statistics reported in  that  of privately run facilities did not offer such programming to inmates according to national research providing inmates with education and vocational programs can reduce the likelihood that offenders will commit new offenses upon release and return to prison in  cca launched the lifeline substance abuse training program at the metrodavidson county detention facility in nashville tennessee in the early st century cca offers the program in  of its  facilities occupancy and profitabilityedit in a s report prudential securities was bullish on cca but noted it takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs low occupancy is a drag on profits company earnings would be strong if cca succeeded in ramping up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate in  responding to an initiative from the state of ohio to reduce overhead costs by saving  million annually while adding  beds to house inmates in the overcrowded system corrections corporation of america agreed to buy the lake erie correctional institution for  million this is a change in company policy as previously cca had always constructed its own prisons the purchase was contingent on the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction agreeing to a high level of occupancy under the contract the state failed to find buyers for many other prisons which it offered for sale this was considered good news by the ohio civil service employees association the union for prison guardscitation needed in  cca sent a letter to prison officials in  states offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a year management contract with a guaranteed occupancy rate of  many community organizations have criticized the proposals arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to  occupancy are poor public policy creating an incentive to criminalize behavior and lengthen sentences in order to keep the prisons filled they believe that these contractual clauses end up costing taxpayers more than staterun prisons would and add to overincarceration employment issuesedit in  cca agreed to pay more than  in back wages to  oklahoma women denied employment because of gender

attack by critics and legislators there had been widespread reports of escapes inmate violence and deplorable conditions in such private facilities speculative prison building sometimes supported by small municipalities hoping to increase local employment had increased competition and the pressure to keep prisons filled cca and the industry as a whole rebounded in the early s following a massive increase by the federal government in detentions of undocumented immigrants in the wake of  attacks this created a new market for its facilities from  to  cca revenue increased  percent and they received at least  billion in revenue for each of the eight years from  to  in  cca derived  percent of its revenue from federal contracts in  some  million for cca came from federal contracts with the bureau of prisons and the us marshals service although they have denied lobbying private prison corporations specifically target republican legislators over immigration reform the companies

from federal contracts in march  president donald j trump announced he would increase immigrant detention although this was announced under the guise of national security the administration decided it would be in the best national interest to radically expand the united states detention capacity specifically for women and children by over fourhundred fifty per cent  us immigration chief stated that

and worked in their communities for such county maintenance functions as litter pickup and park maintenance the sayre prison is far from the mostly urban centers from which inmates had been sentenced and held such as tulsa  miles and oklahoma city  miles this has made it difficult for families and friends to maintain connections that support the prisoners the contract negotiated by allbaughs staff

lobby on crime and sentencing policies among its risk factors listed in its k annual report as required by the sec cca includes the following the demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws for instance any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested convicted and

hundreds of thousands of dollars to its current and former lieutenantscitation needed after losing the suit cca continued to classify their lieutenants as salaried employees saying its cheaper to pay

to submit proper forms but the state was waiting on reports dating back to march  the aclu’s brady henderson said this pointed to a practice within the prison system of concealing records “even in public facilities theres an incredible amount of secrecy a lack of transparency its already hard to know it gets  times harder with a private facility” he said allbaugh said that because of overcrowding in the oklahoma system his agency would continue to do business with private prison companies“as much as i dont think the state ought to be doing business with private prisons im glad

correctional association aca has accredited  of ccas facilities acas accreditation is a system of verification that correctional agencies and facilities comply with national standards promulgated by the american correctional association accreditation is achieved through a series of reviews evaluations audits and hearings on august   deputy us attorney general sally yates announced that the justice department intended to end its bureau of prisons contracts with forprofit prison operators because its own analysis concluded the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services than the federal bureau of prisons in a memorandum yates continued forprofit prisons served an important role during a difficult period but time has shown that they compare poorly to our own bureau facilities they simply do not provide the same level of correctional services programs and resources they do not save substantially on costs and as noted in a recent report by the departments office of inspector general they do not maintain the same level of safety and security the rehabilitative services that the bureau provides such as educational programs and job training have proved difficult to replicate and outsource and these services are essential to reducing recidivism and improving public safety inmate rehabilitationedit the united states prison system provides reentry and rehabilitation programs for inmates such programs often include education vocational training addiction treatment as well as faithbased programs in addition to the reentry and rehabilitation programs prisons often offer inmates recreational and optional faithbased opportunities the latter is considered an integral part of inmate rehabilitation cca says it offers basic adult education postsecondary education gre preparation and testing and literacy programs to all inmates the department of justices bureau of justice statistics reported in  that  of privately run facilities did not offer such programming to inmates according to national research providing inmates with education and vocational programs can reduce the likelihood that offenders will commit new offenses upon release and return to prison in  cca launched the lifeline substance abuse training program at the metrodavidson county detention facility in nashville tennessee in the early st century cca offers the program in  of its  facilities occupancy and profitabilityedit in a s report prudential securities was bullish on cca but noted it takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs low occupancy is a drag on profits company earnings would be strong if cca succeeded in ramping up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate in  responding to an initiative from the state of ohio to reduce overhead costs by saving  million annually while adding  beds to house inmates in the overcrowded system corrections corporation of america agreed to buy the lake erie correctional institution for  million this is a change in company policy as previously cca had always constructed its own prisons the purchase was contingent on the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction agreeing to a high level of occupancy under the contract the state failed to find buyers for many other prisons which it offered for sale this was considered good news by the ohio civil service employees association the union for prison guardscitation needed in  cca sent a letter to prison officials in  states offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a year management contract with a guaranteed occupancy rate of  many community organizations have criticized the proposals arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to  occupancy are poor public policy creating an incentive to criminalize behavior and lengthen sentences in order to keep the prisons filled they believe that these contractual clauses end up costing taxpayers more than staterun prisons would and add to overincarceration employment issuesedit in  cca agreed to pay more than  in back wages to  oklahoma women denied employment because of gender discrimination a us department of labor audit showed women applicants who were equally or better qualified than men hired were rejected in  cca was ranked as one of the  best corporate citizens by

attack by critics and legislators there had been widespread reports of escapes inmate violence and deplorable conditions in such private facilities speculative prison building sometimes supported by small municipalities hoping to increase local employment had increased competition and the pressure to keep prisons filled cca and the industry as a whole rebounded in the early s following a massive increase by the federal government in detentions of undocumented immigrants in the wake of  attacks this created a new market for its facilities from  to  cca revenue increased  percent and they received at least  billion in revenue for each of the eight years from  to  in  cca derived  percent of its revenue from federal contracts in  some  million for cca came from federal contracts with the bureau of prisons and the us marshals service although they have denied lobbying private prison corporations specifically target republican legislators over immigration reform the companies

from federal contracts in march  president donald j trump announced he would increase immigrant detention although this was announced under the guise of national security the administration decided it would be in the best national interest to radically expand the united states detention capacity specifically for women and children by over fourhundred fifty per cent  us immigration chief stated that

and worked in their communities for such county maintenance functions as litter pickup and park maintenance the sayre prison is far from the mostly urban centers from which inmates had been sentenced and held such as tulsa  miles and oklahoma city  miles this has made it difficult for families and friends to maintain connections that support the prisoners the contract negotiated by allbaughs staff

lobby on crime and sentencing policies among its risk factors listed in its k annual report as required by the sec cca includes the following the demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws for instance any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested convicted and sentenced thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them at the federal level the corporations lobbying focuses largely on immigrant detention in  cca spent nearly

hundreds of thousands of dollars to its current and former lieutenantscitation needed after losing the suit cca continued to classify their lieutenants as salaried employees saying its cheaper to pay

about treatment in private prisons “i would say we get roughly double the number per capita from private prison inmates from public prison inmates” the complaints range from safety concerns to lack of appropriate food and medical care cca declined multiple requests for a recorded interview after the cimmaron events oklahoma most recently sent a notice to cure to a private prison in october to

to submit proper forms but the state was waiting on reports dating back to march  the aclu’s brady henderson said this pointed to a practice within the prison system of concealing records “even in public facilities theres an incredible amount of secrecy a lack of transparency its already hard to know it gets  times harder with a private facility” he said allbaugh said that because of overcrowding in the oklahoma system his agency would continue to do business with private prison companies“as much as i dont think the state ought to be doing business with private prisons im glad

correctional association aca has accredited  of ccas facilities acas accreditation is a system of verification that correctional agencies and facilities comply with national standards promulgated by the american correctional association accreditation is achieved through a series of reviews evaluations audits and hearings on august   deputy us attorney general sally yates announced that the justice department intended to end its bureau of prisons contracts with forprofit prison operators because its own analysis concluded the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services than the federal bureau of prisons in a memorandum yates continued forprofit prisons served an important role during a difficult period but time has shown that they compare poorly to our own bureau facilities they simply do not provide the same level of correctional services programs and resources they do not save substantially on costs and as noted in a recent report by the departments office of inspector general they do not maintain the same level of safety and security the rehabilitative services that the bureau provides such as educational programs and job training have proved difficult to replicate and outsource and these services are essential to reducing recidivism and improving public safety inmate rehabilitationedit the united states prison system provides reentry and rehabilitation programs for inmates such programs often include education vocational training addiction treatment as well as faithbased programs in addition to the reentry and rehabilitation programs prisons often offer inmates recreational and optional faithbased opportunities the latter is considered an integral part of inmate rehabilitation cca says it offers basic adult education postsecondary education gre preparation and testing and literacy programs to all inmates the department of justices bureau of justice statistics reported in  that  of privately run facilities did not offer such programming to inmates according to national research providing inmates with education and vocational programs can reduce the likelihood that offenders will commit new offenses upon release and return to prison in  cca launched the lifeline substance abuse training program at the metrodavidson county detention facility in nashville tennessee in the early st century cca offers the program in  of its  facilities occupancy and profitabilityedit in a s report prudential securities was bullish on cca but noted it takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs low occupancy is a drag on profits company earnings would be strong if cca succeeded in ramping up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate in  responding to an initiative from the state of ohio to reduce overhead costs by saving  million annually while adding  beds to house inmates in the overcrowded system corrections corporation of america agreed to buy the lake erie correctional institution for  million this is a change in company policy as previously cca had always constructed its own prisons the purchase was contingent on the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction agreeing to a high level of occupancy under the contract the state failed to find buyers for many other prisons which it offered for sale this was considered good news by the ohio civil service employees association the union for prison guardscitation needed in  cca sent a letter to prison officials in  states offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a year management contract with a guaranteed occupancy rate of  many community organizations have criticized the proposals arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to  occupancy are poor public policy creating an incentive to criminalize behavior and lengthen sentences in order to keep the prisons filled they believe that these contractual clauses end up costing taxpayers more than staterun prisons would and add to overincarceration employment issuesedit in  cca agreed to pay more than  in back wages to  oklahoma women denied employment because of gender discrimination a us department of labor audit showed women applicants who were equally or better qualified than men hired were rejected in  cca was ranked as one of the  best corporate citizens by

blackrock fidelity investments and others immigrant detention facilitiesedit the prison industry declined in the late th century as the crime rate was decreasing nationally and privatization was under attack by critics and legislators there had been widespread reports of escapes inmate violence and deplorable conditions in such private facilities speculative prison building sometimes supported by small municipalities hoping to increase local employment had increased competition and the pressure to keep prisons filled cca and the industry as a whole rebounded in the early s following a massive increase by the federal government in detentions of undocumented immigrants in the wake of  attacks this created a new market for its facilities from  to  cca revenue increased  percent and they received at least  billion in revenue for each of the eight years from  to  in  cca derived  percent of its revenue from federal contracts in  some  million for cca came from federal contracts with the bureau of prisons and the us marshals service although they have denied lobbying private prison corporations specifically target republican legislators over immigration reform the companies

from federal contracts in march  president donald j trump announced he would increase immigrant detention although this was announced under the guise of national security the administration decided it would be in the best national interest to radically expand the united states detention capacity specifically for women and children by over fourhundred fifty per cent  us immigration chief stated that

and worked in their communities for such county maintenance functions as litter pickup and park maintenance the sayre prison is far from the mostly urban centers from which inmates had been sentenced and held such as tulsa  miles and oklahoma city  miles this has made it difficult for families and friends to maintain connections that support the prisoners the contract negotiated by allbaughs staff

that it does not lobby lawmakers to increase jail time or push for longer sentences under any circumstance noting that it educates officials on the benefits of publicprivate partnership but does not lobby on crime and sentencing policies among its risk factors listed in its k annual report as required by the sec cca includes the following the demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws for instance any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested convicted and sentenced thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them at the federal level the corporations lobbying focuses largely on immigrant detention in  cca spent nearly

idaho prisonedit in  the fbi conducted an investigation of cca practices following an incident at their prison in idaho correctional center in which a prison inmate was beaten unconscious in an inmate

contract to operate the idaho correctional center the state took back control and operations of its prison on july   also in  former and current employees in lieutenant positions who were categorized as salary employees filed lawsuits arguing that their daily duties and work hours were not that of a salary employee they worked considerable overtime specifically they sued cca because their actual duties were not those of typical salaried employees in criminal justice nor did they have the authority to hire and fire as a salaried employee should cca lost the lawsuit and paid a settlement of hundreds of thousands of dollars to its current and former lieutenantscitation needed after losing the suit cca continued to classify their lieutenants as salaried employees saying its cheaper to pay

segregate these gangs so they are together in close quarters and so sometimes things happen” the american civil liberties union alcu of oklahoma director says it receives “a great deal” of complaints about treatment in private prisons “i would say we get roughly double the number per capita from private prison inmates from public prison inmates” the complaints range from safety concerns to lack of appropriate food and medical care cca declined multiple requests for a recorded interview after the cimmaron events oklahoma most recently sent a notice to cure to a private prison in october to inform cimarron correctional facility it was more than seven months behind in reporting use of force standards and reportable incidents according to doc’s contract with cca the business has five days to submit proper forms but the state was waiting on reports dating back to march  the aclu’s brady henderson said this pointed to a practice within the prison system of concealing records “even in public facilities theres an incredible amount of secrecy a lack of transparency its already hard to know it gets  times harder with a private facility” he said allbaugh said that because of overcrowding in the oklahoma system his agency would continue to do business with private prison companies“as much as i dont think the state ought to be doing business with private prisons im glad theyre around because theyre our only relief valve available to us during this crunch” in march  video from a contraband cell phone was released that showed a group of inmates throwing another

the american correctional association accreditation is achieved through a series of reviews evaluations audits and hearings on august   deputy us attorney general sally yates announced that the justice department intended to end its bureau of prisons contracts with forprofit prison operators because its own analysis concluded the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services than the federal bureau of prisons in a memorandum yates continued forprofit prisons served an important role during a difficult period but time has shown that they compare poorly to our own bureau facilities they simply do not provide the same level of correctional services programs and resources they do not save substantially on costs and as noted in a recent report by the departments office of inspector general they do not maintain the same level of safety and security the rehabilitative services that the bureau provides such as educational programs and job training have proved difficult to replicate and outsource and these services are essential to reducing recidivism and improving public safety inmate rehabilitationedit the united states prison system provides reentry and rehabilitation programs for inmates such programs often include education vocational training addiction treatment as well as faithbased programs in addition to the reentry and rehabilitation programs prisons often offer inmates recreational and optional faithbased opportunities the latter is considered an integral part of inmate rehabilitation cca says it offers basic adult education postsecondary education gre preparation and testing and literacy programs to all inmates the department of justices bureau of justice statistics reported in  that  of privately run facilities did not offer such programming to inmates according to national research providing inmates with education and vocational programs can reduce the likelihood that offenders will commit new offenses upon release and return to prison in  cca launched the lifeline substance abuse training program at the metrodavidson county detention facility in nashville tennessee in the early st century cca offers the program in  of its  facilities occupancy and profitabilityedit in a s report prudential securities was bullish on cca but noted it takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs low occupancy is a drag on profits company earnings would be strong if cca succeeded in ramping up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate in  responding to an initiative from the state of ohio to reduce overhead costs by saving  million annually while adding  beds to house inmates in the overcrowded system corrections corporation of america agreed to buy the lake erie correctional institution for  million this is a change in company policy as previously cca had always constructed its own prisons the purchase was contingent on the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction agreeing to a high level of occupancy under the contract the state failed to find buyers for many other prisons which it offered for sale this was considered good news by the ohio civil service employees association the union for prison guardscitation needed in  cca sent a letter to prison officials in  states offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a year management contract with a guaranteed occupancy rate of  many community organizations have criticized the proposals arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to  occupancy are poor public policy creating an incentive to criminalize behavior and lengthen sentences in order to keep the prisons filled they believe that these contractual clauses end up costing taxpayers more than staterun prisons would and add to overincarceration employment issuesedit in  cca agreed to pay more than  in back wages to  oklahoma women denied employment because of gender

attack by critics and legislators there had been widespread reports of escapes inmate violence and deplorable conditions in such private facilities speculative prison building sometimes supported by small municipalities hoping to increase local employment had increased competition and the pressure to keep prisons filled cca and the industry as a whole rebounded in the early s following a massive increase by the federal government in detentions of undocumented immigrants in the wake of  attacks this created a new market for its facilities from  to  cca revenue increased  percent and they received at least  billion in revenue for each of the eight years from  to  in  cca derived  percent of its revenue from federal contracts in  some  million for cca came from federal contracts with

the american correctional association accreditation is achieved through a series of reviews evaluations audits and hearings on august   deputy us attorney general sally yates announced that the justice department intended to end its bureau of prisons contracts with forprofit prison operators because its own analysis concluded the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services than the federal bureau of prisons in a memorandum yates continued forprofit prisons served an important role during a difficult period but time has shown that they compare poorly to our own bureau facilities they simply do not provide the same level of correctional services programs and resources they do not save substantially on costs and as noted in a recent report by the departments office of inspector general they do not maintain the same level of safety and security the rehabilitative services that the bureau provides such as educational programs and job training have proved difficult to replicate and outsource and these services are essential to reducing recidivism and improving public safety inmate rehabilitationedit the united states prison system provides reentry and rehabilitation programs for inmates such programs often include education vocational training addiction treatment as well as faithbased programs in addition to the reentry and rehabilitation programs prisons often offer inmates recreational and optional faithbased opportunities the latter is considered an integral part of inmate rehabilitation cca says it offers basic adult education postsecondary education gre preparation and testing and literacy programs to all inmates the department of justices bureau of justice statistics reported in  that  of privately run facilities did not offer such programming to inmates according to national research providing inmates with education and vocational programs can reduce the likelihood that offenders will commit new offenses upon release and return to prison in  cca launched the lifeline substance abuse training program at the metrodavidson county detention facility in nashville tennessee in the early st century cca offers the program in  of its  facilities occupancy and profitabilityedit in a s report prudential securities was bullish on cca but noted it takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs low occupancy is a drag on profits company earnings would be strong if cca succeeded in ramping up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate in  responding to an initiative from the state of ohio to reduce overhead costs by saving  million annually while adding  beds to house inmates in the overcrowded system corrections corporation of america agreed to buy the lake erie correctional institution for  million this is a change in company policy as previously cca had always constructed its own prisons the purchase was contingent on the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction agreeing to a high level of occupancy under the contract the state failed to find buyers for many other prisons which it offered for sale this was considered good news by the ohio civil service employees association the union for prison guardscitation needed in  cca sent a letter to prison officials in  states offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a year management contract with a guaranteed occupancy rate of  many community organizations have criticized the proposals arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to  occupancy are poor public policy creating an incentive to criminalize behavior and lengthen sentences in order to keep the prisons filled they believe that these contractual clauses end up costing taxpayers more than staterun prisons would and add to overincarceration employment issuesedit in  cca agreed to pay more than  in back wages to  oklahoma women denied employment because of gender

attack by critics and legislators there had been widespread reports of escapes inmate violence and deplorable conditions in such private facilities speculative prison building sometimes supported by small municipalities hoping to increase local employment had increased competition and the pressure to keep prisons filled cca and the industry as a whole rebounded in the early s following a massive increase by the federal government in detentions of undocumented immigrants in the wake of  attacks this created a new market for its facilities from  to  cca revenue increased  percent and they received at least  billion in revenue for each of the eight years from  to  in  cca derived  percent of its revenue from federal contracts in  some  million for cca came from federal contracts with the bureau of prisons and the us marshals service although they have denied lobbying private prison corporations specifically target republican legislators over immigration reform the companies
