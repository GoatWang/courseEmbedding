china and australia and lithium contracts increased dramatically across all global marketplaces electric vehicles which use large quantities of lithium for their batteries are rapidly gaining popularity among consumers even a lowsingledigit percentage increase in the market share of electric cars would double the worlds lithium demand lithium on the rise lithium was the topperforming

lithium industry fundamentals the lithium industry is in the midst of a revolution while lithium has long been valued as a key component of batteries for consumer electronics a new development has taken place that has made lithium more valuable than ever before the rise of electric vehicles from cars and trucks to trains and even airplanes more electric vehicles are being produced now than ever before electric vehicles require massive amounts of lithium to power them which is causing a massive increase in demand acknowledged demand growth for decades lithiumion batteries have powered consumer electronics but recently a major shift in the market has occurred as lithium has become a power source for electric cars public transportation systems and even the electric grid on december   goldman sachs released a report predicting that lithium would become the “new gasoline” that report revealed the paradigmshifting fact that a single tesla model s requires as much lithium as  cell phones insufficient supply growth current hardrock and brine lithium projects are capacity constrained with output consistently failing to keep pace with demand most brine sources are located in geopolitically unstable regions and are geographically far removed from major lithium consumers the us has only one commercial lithium development operation and imports  of lithium it consumes despite lithium being considered one of the most important metals for the batterypowered future lithium accounts for roughly  of the cost of lithiumion batteries this means that the price of lithium can increase dramatically without becoming particularly noticeable to buyers of consumer electronics electric vehicles or large storage batteries prices are projected to rise lithium prices on most exchanges have at least tripled since  in china growth has been especially fastpaced with the price of one metric tonne of lithium having increased from us in  to over us in  on some exchanges fmc recently announced an “acrosstheboard  increase in the price of lithium” supply and demand market forces are converging on the lithium industry in an unprecedented way as new technologies bring demand for lithium higher the metal remains as rare as ever with much of the global supply being located in geopolitically unstable regions this fact presents opportunity for lithium producers in politically stable areas such as nevada and california even a  increase in the market share of electric cars could increase the price of lithium by up to  this bodes well for companies involved in the exploration
