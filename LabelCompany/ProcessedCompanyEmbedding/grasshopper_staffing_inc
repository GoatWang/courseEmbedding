shortterm loans from its officers and directors to meet its shortterm funding needs the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures as of july   the financial position of the company at the year ended july   showed an increase in assets to  from  at july   this was due primarily to increases in the companys deferred accounts receivable amounts the liabilities at july   increases to  from  at july   this increase was partially the result of an increase in accounts payable and monies due to a related party critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following critical policies affect the companys more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the companys financial statements the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america these principals require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period management believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the board however actual results could differ from those estimates the company issues restricted stock to consultants for various services and employees for compensation cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is measurable more reliably measurable the value of the common stock is measured at the earlier of i the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or ii the date at which the counterpartys performance is complete the company issues options and warrants to consultants directors and officers as compensation for services these options and warrants are valued using the blackscholes model which focuses on the current stock price and the volatility of moves to predict the likelihood of future stock moves this method of valuation is typically used to accurately price stock options and warrants based on the price of the underlying stock longlived assets such as property equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset the fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows market value of similar assets if available or independent appraisals if required if the carrying amount of the longlived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset when fair values are not available the company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets the company did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented fair value estimates used in preparation of the financial statements are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values these financial instruments include cash accounts payable note payable and due to related parties fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are shortterm in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are receivable or payable on demand revenue recognition revenue is derived from the placement of temporary workers the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or

       item a risk factors   risks related to our business   marijuana remains illegal under federal law   marijuana is a schedule i controlled substance and is illegal under federal law even in states that have legalized the use of marijuana its sale and use remain violations of federal law the illegality of marijuana under federal law preempts state laws that legalize its use therefore strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in our inability to proceed with our business plan   our business is dependent on laws pertaining to the marijuana industry   the united states federal government regulates drugs through the controlled substances act  usc §  which places controlled substances including cannabis in a schedule cannabis is classified as a schedule i drug which is viewed as highly addictive and having no medical value the united states federal drug administration has not approved the sale of marijuana for any medical application doctors may not prescribe cannabis for medical use under federal law however they can recommend its use under the first amendment in  the united states veterans affairs department clarified that veterans using medicinal cannabis will not be denied services or other medications that are denied to those using illegal drugs   as of november    states the district of columbia and guam allow their citizens to use medical cannabis through decriminalization voters in the states of oregon colorado washington and alaska have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use oregon’s law took effect on july   alaska’s law was effective february   both the colorado and washington programs were enacted as of december   in  nevada california vermont arizona connecticut and michigan have legislative bills in various stages of progress concerning cannabis legalization   these noted state laws both proposed and enacted are in conflict with the federal controlled substances act which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level however on august   the us department of justice issued a memorandum providing that where states and local governments enact laws authorizing cannabisrelated use and implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems the federal government will rely upon states and local enforcement agencies to address cannabis activity through the enforcement of their own state and local narcotics laws the memorandum further stated that the us justice department’s limited investigative and prosecutorial resources will be focused on eight priorities to prevent unintended consequences of the state laws including distribution of cannabis to minors preventing the distribution of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not and preventing money laundering violence and drugged driving   on december   the us department of justice issued another memorandum with regard to its position and enforcement protocol with regard to indian country stating that the eight priorities in the previous federal memo would guide the united states attorneys cannabis enforcement efforts in indian country on december   as a component of the federal spending bill the obama administration enacted regulations that prohibit the department of justice from using funds to prosecute statebased legal medical cannabis programs as of june   in addition to the  states and the district of columbia which had already passed legislation allowing citizens to use cannabis in some form an additional  states had pending legislation or ballot measures to legalize medical cannabis   these noted state laws both proposed and enacted are in conflict with the federal controlled substances act which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level however on august   the us department of justice issued a memorandum providing that where states and local governments enact laws authorizing cannabisrelated use and implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems the federal government will rely upon states and local enforcement agencies to address cannabis activity through the enforcement of their own state and local narcotics laws the memorandum further stated that the us justice department’s limited investigative and prosecutorial resources will be focused on eight priorities to prevent unintended consequences of the state laws including distribution of cannabis to minors preventing the distribution of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not and preventing money laundering violence and drugged driving          on december   the us department of justice issued another memorandum with regard to its position and enforcement protocol with regard to indian country stating that the eight priorities in the previous federal memo would guide the united states attorneys cannabis enforcement efforts in indian country on december   as a component of the federal spending bill the obama administration enacted regulations that prohibit the department of justice from using funds to prosecute statebased legal medical cannabis programs   laws and regulations affecting our industry are constantly changing   the constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the marijuana industry could detrimentally affect our operations local state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to changing interpretations these changes may require us to incur substantial costs associated with legal and compliance fees and ultimately require us to alter our business plan furthermore violations of these laws or alleged violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations in addition we cannot predict the nature of any future laws regulations interpretations or applications and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business   risk of government action   while we will use our best efforts to comply with all laws including federal state and local laws and regulations there is a possibility that governmental action to enforce any alleged violations may result in legal fees and damage awards that would adversely affect us   because our business is dependent upon continued market acceptance by consumers any negative trends will adversely affect our business operations   we are substantially dependent on continued market acceptance and proliferation of consumers of medical marijuana and recreational marijuana we believe that as marijuana becomes more accepted the stigma associated with marijuana use will diminish and as a result consumer demand will continue to grow   while we believe that the market and opportunity in the marijuana space continues to grow we cannot predict the future growth rate and size of the market any negative outlook on the marijuana industry will adversely affect our business operations   in addition it is believed by many that large wellfunded businesses may have a strong economic opposition to the cannabis industry we believe that the pharmaceutical industry clearly does not want to cede control of any product that could generate significant revenue for example medical marijuana will likely adversely impact the existing market for the current marijuana pill marinol sold by the mainstream pharmaceutical industry should marijuana displace other drugs or encroach upon the pharmaceutical industrys products the pharmaceutical industry is well funded with a strong and experienced lobby that eclipses the funding of the medical marijuana movement any inroads the pharmaceutical could make in halting the impending cannabis industry could have a detrimental impact on our business   fda regulation of marijuana and the possible registration of facilities where medical marijuana is grown could negatively affect the cannabis industry which would directly affect our financial condition   should the federal government legalize marijuana for medical use it is possible that the us food and drug administration fda would seek to regulate it under the food drug and cosmetics act of  additionally the fda may issue rules and regulations including cgmps certified good manufacturing practices related to the growth cultivation harvesting and processing of medical marijuana clinical trials may be needed to verify efficacy and safety it is also possible that the fda would require that facilities where medical marijuana is grown be registered with the fda and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations in the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed we do not know what the impact would be on the medical marijuana industry and what costs requirements and possible prohibitions may be enforced if we are unable to comply with the regulations andor registration as prescribed by the fda we may be unable to continue to operate our business            our clients may have difficulty accessing the service of banks   on february   the us government issued rules allowing banks to legally provide financial services to statelicensed marijuana businesses a memorandum issued by the justice department to federal prosecutors reiterated guidance previously given this time to the financial industry that banks can do business with legal marijuana businesses and may not be prosecuted the treasury departments financial crimes enforcement network fincen issued guidelines to banks that it is possible to provide financial services to statelicensed marijuana businesses and still be in compliance with federal antimoney laundering laws the guidance falls short of the explicit legal authorization that banking industry officials had pushed the government to provide and to date it is not clear if any banks have relied on the guidance and taken on legal marijuana companies as clients the aforementioned policy may be administration dependent and a change in presidential administrations may cause a policy reversal and retraction of current policies wherein legal marijuana businesses may not have access to the banking industry also the inability of potential clients in our target market to open accounts and otherwise use the service of banks may make it difficult for them to contract with us   due to our involvement in the cannabis industry we may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate our business which may expose us to additional risk and financial liability   insurance that is otherwise readily available such as general liability and directors and officer’s insurance is more difficult for us to find and more expensive because we are service providers to companies in the cannabis industry there are no guarantees that we will be able to find such insurances in the future or that the cost will be affordable to us if we are forced to go without such insurances it may prevent us from entering into certain business sectors may inhibit our growth and may expose us to additional risk and financial liabilities   the company’s industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors which may give them and advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete   we are involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or approaches who may have far greater resources more experience and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do such resources may give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products obsolete there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities   the company may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its industry and such change may increase costs and competition that may adversely affect its business   rapidly changing technologies frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards characterize the company’s market the continued growth of the internet and intense competition in the company’s industry exacerbate these market characteristics the company’s future success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of its products and services the company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction or marketing of its products and services in addition any new enhancements must meet the requirements of its current and prospective users and must achieve significant market acceptance the company could also incur substantial costs if it needs to modify its products and services or infrastructures to adapt to these changes   the company also expects that new competitors may introduce products systems or services that are directly or indirectly competitive with the company these competitors may succeed in developing products systems and services that have greater functionality or are less costly than the company’s products systems and services and may be more successful in marketing such products systems and services technological changes have lowered the cost of operating communications and computer systems and purchasing software these changes reduce the company’s cost of providing services but also facilitate increased competition by reducing competitors’ costs in providing similar services this competition could increase price competition and reduce anticipated profit margins        the company’s industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitor which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete   we are involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or approaches who may have far greater resources more experience and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do such resources may give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products obsolete there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities   the company’s services are new and its industry is evolving   you should consider the company’s prospects in light of the risks uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development particularly companies in the rapidly evolving legal cannabis industry to be successful in this industry the company must among other things   · develop and introduce functional and attractive service offerings   · attract and maintain a large base of consumers   · increase awareness of the company brand and develop consumer loyalty   · establish and maintain strategic relationships with distribution partners and service providers   · respond to competitive and technological developments   · build an operations structure to support the company business and   · attract retain and motivate qualified personnel   the company cannot guarantee that it will succeed in achieving these goals and its failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on its business prospects financial condition and operating results   some of the company’s products and services are new and are only in early stages of commercialization the company is not certain that these products and services will function as anticipated or be desirable to its intended market also some of the company’s products and services may have limited functionalities which may limit their appeal to consumers and put the company at a competitive disadvantage if the company’s current or future products and services fail to function properly or if the company does not achieve or sustain market acceptance it could lose customers or could be subject to claims which could have a material adverse effect on the company business financial condition and operating results   as is typical in a new and rapidly evolving industry demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk because the market for the company is new and evolving it is difficult to predict with any certainty the size of this market and its growth rate if any the company cannot guarantee that a market for the company will develop or that demand for company services will emerge or be sustainable if the market fails to develop develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors the company’s business financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected   risks related to our company   uncertainty of profitability   our business strategy may result in increased volatility of revenues and earnings as we will only develop a limited number of products and services at a time our overall success will depend on a limited number of products and services which may cause variability and unsteady profits and losses depending on the products and services offered        our revenues and our profitability may be adversely affected by economic conditions and changes in the market for medical and recreational marijuana our business is also subject to general economic risks that could adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition   because of the anticipated nature of the products and services that we will attempt to develop it is difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and these items could fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors these factors may include among other things the following   · our ability to raise sufficient capital to take advantage of opportunities and generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses   · our ability to source strong opportunities with sufficient risk adjusted returns   · our ability to manage our capital and liquidity requirements based on changing market conditions generally and changes in the developing legal medical marijuana and recreational marijuana industries   · the acceptance of the terms and conditions of our licenses andor the acceptance of our royalties and fees   · the amount and timing of operating and other costs and expenses   · the nature and extent of competition from other companies that may reduce market share and create pressure on pricing and investment return expectations   · adverse changes in the national and regional economies in which we will participate including but not limited to changes in our performance capital availability and market demand   · adverse changes in the projects in which we plan to invest which result from factors beyond our control including but not limited to a change in circumstances capacity and economic impacts   · adverse developments in the efforts to legalize marijuana or increased federal enforcement   · changes in laws regulations accounting taxation and other requirements affecting our operations and business   · our operating results may fluctuate from year to year due to the factors listed above and others not listed at times these fluctuations may be significant   management of growth will be necessary for us to be competitive   successful expansion of our business will depend on our ability to effectively attract and manage staff strategic business relationships and shareholders specifically we will need to hire skilled management and technical personnel as well as manage partnerships to navigate shifts in the general economic environment expansion has the potential to place significant strains on financial management and operational resources yet failure to expand will inhibit our profitability goals   we are entering a potentially highly competitive market   the markets for ancillary businesses in the medical marijuana and recreational marijuana industries are competitive and evolving in particular we face strong competition from larger companies that may be in the process of offering similar products and services to ours many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories significantly greater financial marketing and other resources and larger client bases than we have or may be expected to have            given the rapid changes affecting the global national and regional economies generally and the medical marijuana and recreational marijuana industries in particular we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with any changes in its markets especially with legal and regulatory changes our success will depend on our ability to respond to among other things changes in the economy market conditions and competitive pressures any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results liquidity cash flow and our operational performance   if we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to prevent fraud  any ability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the future trading price of our common stock   effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed as a result our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition results of operation and access to capital   we currently have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements additionally there is a lack of formal process and timeline for closing the books and records at the end of each reporting period and such weaknesses restrict the company’s ability to timely gather analyze and report information relative to the financial statements   because of the company’s limited resources there are limited controls over information processing there is inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives our company’s management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist in order to remedy this situation we would need to hire additional staff   the company’s failure to continue to attract train or retain highly qualified personnel could harm the company’s business   the company’s success also depends on the company’s ability to attract train and retain qualified personnel specifically those with management and product development skills in particular the company must hire additional skilled personnel to further the company’s research and development efforts competition for such personnel is intense if the company does not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating the company’s current personnel the company’s business could be harmed   risks related to our common stock   because we will likely issue additional shares of our common stock investment in our company

industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s

noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements make it more

value of the shares was  at the date of grant which will be recognized as expense in the quarter ending july     these shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under section  of the securities act these shares of the company’s common stock qualified for exemption under section  since the issuance shares by the company did not involve a public offering the offering was not a “public offering” as defined in section  due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal size of the offering manner of the offering and number of shares offered in addition the investors had the necessary investment intent as required by section  since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to rule  of the act this
