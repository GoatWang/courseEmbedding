news  media ← back bell allstar leonard harvey nitz a true olympian when leonard harvey nitz attended his first world championships as a junior bike racer in  no american had won a medal at the world or olympic level in seven decades as nitz says “american bike racing was in the stone ages at junior worlds i was warming up in blue jeans i didn’t even own a pair of tights” and though he went on to race at three olympiads and won two medals in the ’ la games he remained a true amateur “a lot of people wondered why i never turned pro” he says “but i was very happy where i was at” born in ohio nitz moved with his family to northern california when he was a year old today at age  he still lives in the sacramento area where he’s a highly respected cycling coach — and masters racer nitz says the olympic spirit is something that’s been with him since childhood “every olympic games my whole family would sit in front of the tv and when i was about  and met my first olympian speed skater bill disney i was so much in awe around the same time i met another olympic speed skater buddy campbell who was also a track cyclist he said ‘anybody can become a world champion if they desire it deep enough and they have the willpower to train hard enough’ so i wondered if i could too … ” nitz saw his first bike race at the encino velodrome in los angeles “i was thinking these guys are nuts” he says “i’d never ride a bike without brakes” a few years later when nitz was  “a kid down the street talked me into riding the davis double century it took me like  hours — and took me two months to recover from” but a year later he repeated that mile ride at  nitz and “that kid” began bike racing “my first race was the tour of nevada city one of the hardest races in california i was lapped my second race was the chico criterium i got lapped by a guy on a solo breakaway i jumped on his wheel but two laps later he turned around — i looked so bad and had no shaved legs — and he told me to get off his wheel that gentleman’s name was jacques boyer who’d become the first american to ride the tour de france” despite his inauspicious start nitz raced once more that year the district road championships “there were  juniors on the line” he recalls “it was a deadflat circuit in the san joaquin valley and came down to a field sprint i ended up getting third i was pretty excited about that” excited enough to start racing every weekend the following year and despite saying he’d never do track racing he took it up and promptly won the individual pursuit at the junior worlds trials within two years he raced the individual and team pursuit events at the montreal olympics he was living the dream “i was still training without a helmet” nitz says “but i grew up on a motorcycle and always wore a helmet on my dirt bike” so when he was given one of the first bell bicycle helmets in  he first used it for mountain biking “i was falling down a lot” he says “so i wore the helmet all the time and when i got on a road bike i felt naked” as a result nitz was one of the first road racers to use a hardshell helmet — a decade before they became mandatory that rule didn’t get approved until  so nitz’s favorite bell helmet from the ’ olympics “was just about aerodynamics” he wore that aero helmet to win medals in both pursuit events his opponent in the individual pursuit thirdplace final was dean woods of australia “i was a secondandahalf down on him after three laps” nitz says “so i had to get into my head ‘this is the olympics games — you’ve got to get going’ with three laps to go i was still down it was now or never i caught him by surprise i was sprinting but i was dying coming apart my arms were twitching starting to lose control of the muscles i was ahead with a lap to go but he came back — and i won by just fivehundredths of a second i was ecstatic getting that bronze medal” nitz again faced dean each with their three teammates in the team pursuit final unfortunately one of the americans pulled a foot out of his pedal on the start line “we tried hard” nitz remembers “but with only three guys we couldn’t beat the aussies” so it was silver for the home team nitz went on to take a bronze medal in the points race at the ’ worlds in colorado springs and rode his third olympics at seoul in  through his elite career nitz had occasional crashes including one at the ’ track nationals “my front wheel dropped off during the kilo” he says “the doctor said he wouldn’t touch me ‘but i just fell on my face’ i pleaded he called in the plastic surgeon and it turned out to be  stitches” nitz says his most serious crash was his own fault “i got back from a bike race unpacked my bike from the plane spun my pedal on and the telephone rang i answered the phone and didn’t tighten the pedal the next day when i’m riding the pedal starts unspinning i’m doing  miles per hour up a hill step down pedal comes off foot goes down my whole body rotates and i’m going down hitting my back and whiplashing my head to the ground the whole back end of my helmet was caved in i just said to myself my helmet just saved my life — and that was a bell helmet” leonard harvey

new haven to cheshire connecticut alexion moved back to new haven following the completion of new havens downtown crossing project in december   alexions new headquarters are located at  college street since  alexion has been a supporter of healthcare research and quality studies at duke university for aspirin and clopidogrel trade name plavix alexion received us food and drug administration fda approval for soliris in  it was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria a rare blood disorder in  there was an outbreak of hemolyticuremic syndrome caused by enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ehec in germany soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome an illness similar to the one caused by the ehec infection as a result alexions german subsidiary provided an unspecified number of soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it in april  alexion was added to the nasdaq a group composed of the  largest nonfinancial stocks traded on the nasdaq with a market value of usd  billion it replaced genzyme corporation in april  bell was replaced as ceo by david hallal in  the company became a member of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma in december  alexions board of directors announced new leadership the board identified david brennan formerly of az and a current board member as the interim ceo to replace david hallal david anderson formerly the cfo of honeywell was appointed as the new cfo replacing vikas sinha in march  alexion named ludwig n hantson as its new ceo acquisitionsedit in  alexion purchased proliferon inc a san diego california based developmentstage biopharmaceutical firm for us million in alexion stock alexion ceo leonard bell cited proliferons ability to produce an unlimited amount of antibodies as the reason for the acquisition at the time proliferons annual revenue was about  million and its assets were valued at  million the company has since been renamed alexion antibody technologies inc in december  alexion acquired montrealbased enobia pharma corp for  million upfront and up to another  million later contingent on company sales and regulatory goals the  million includes  million in bank debt enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia in may  alexion announced plans to purchase the lexington firm synageva biopharma a maker of rare disease treatments run by exgenzyme executive sanj patel who negotiated an  billion stockandcash deal in the deal each share of synageva which is traded on nasdaq will be exchanged for  in cash and  shares of alexion stock the price represented more than a  premium over synagevas market cap at the time it also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales double what is typical for the biotech industry analysis by the wall street journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position the rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims due to small population sizes of patients and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition alexion said it expects to save  million in costs by the end of  by combining with synageva it does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until  the deal would give alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials and  others in preclinical trials synagevas main drug kanuma could receive approval in the united states and europe as early as the third quarter of  the boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid alexion shares fell  the day after the deal was announced acquisition historyedit the following is an illustration of the companys mergers acquisitions spinoffs and historical predecessors alexion pharmaceuticals alexion

mainly held by institutional investors fidelity investments t rowe price blackrock and others productsedit specialty drugsedit main article specialty drugs alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases since the targeted user base is small for such drugs clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs additionally big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets creating a niche with minimal competition for alexion insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs since few of their customers need the drugs a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays the success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in declinespecialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined solirisedit main article eculizumab alexions first drug soliris used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ahus and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pnh it has been approved for use in canada the european union japan and the united states however availability in canada is limited in canada access to the drug is mostly through private clinics groups such as the canadian association of pnh patients are lobbying to change that the drug costs roughly  a year and is considered the worlds most expensive drug the price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price as a result alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse the prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price in addition much of the research for the development of soliris originates from publicly funded universities there is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug in september  the fda officially approved the use of soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolyticuremic syndrome in both adults and children more than half of people with ahus end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organsorgan failure usually involving the kidneys caused by uncontrolled complement activation the fdas decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of pediatric nephrology at atlantas childrens hospital calling it the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease by  soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world it costs £ per year for treatment in the uk and  a year in canada and us a year in the united states  in the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than  people biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases can charge pretty much whatever they want before testing soliris for pnh alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis which afflicts  million americans the trials failed but if it had worked for arthritis alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere  alexion started selling soliris in  making  million in  with its stock price rising to  in  in april and may  a controversy arose in belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a sevenyearold boys treatment because soliris was too expensive the boys medicine cost  euros every two weeks on may   de standaard reported that a press relations pr agency working for alexion had helped the boys parents communicate their story to the press it was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a dutch organization for patients and that the pr agency acted with permission from alexion several politicians stated that the company was attempting to blackmail the government charges which alexion denied by may   an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine pharma the belgian pharmaceutical industrys association opened an internal investigation into the affair for possible breach of the associations ethical standards by alexion however on june  alexion received a court gag order against pharma preventing it from communicating its investigation at the same time pharma opened a court case against alexion pharma belgium the gag order was revoked by the end of september  but the case was still pending in march  strensiqedit in october  alexions second drug strensiq asfotase alfa was approved by the us fda it is used to treat hypophosphatasia a rare metabolic disorder kanumaedit kanuma which alexion acquired in its acquisition of synageva was approved in  to treat lysosomal acid lipase deficiency a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls the liver and other tissues alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than  billion financialsedit in   alexions sales originated in the us down from  the previous year  came from europe down from  japan accounted for just over  revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for soliris up  and a decreased average price related to rebates in europe acquisition related costs fell significantly from  million to just  million rd spending reached a record high of  million in  up  from the previous year when soliris was first approved peak annual sales were estimated at  million however by september  quarterly sales of soliris topped  million sales during the first quarter of  were just over us million and are still on the rise before the synageva purchase announcement alexion was valued at  billion the stock is up roughly  in the last five years and is currently trading at  times estimated earnings due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of soliris the company has enjoyed a high profit margin referencesedit  a b alexion pharmaceuticals inc k report

alexion stock the price represented more than a  premium over synagevas market cap at the time it also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales double what is typical for the

phs s bell work leonard v pepsico due oct   by pm points  submitting a text entry box first watch the video at the beginning of class then read the following facts about the case of leonard versus pepsi who would you side with and why   leonard v pepsico cold hard facts   inspired by the commercial leonard set out to obtain a harrier jet leonard explains that he is typical of the pepsi generation  he is young has an adventurous spirit and the notion of obtaining a harrier jet appealed to him enormously… although leonard initially set out to collect  pepsi points by consuming pepsi products it soon became clear to him that he would not be able to buy let alone drink enough pepsi to collect the necessary pepsi points fast enough reevaluating his strategy leonard focused for the first time on the packaging materials in the pepsi stuff promotion and realized that buying pepsi points would be a more promising option through acquaintances leonard ultimately raised about  on or about march   leonard submitted a pepsi points order form fifteen original pepsi points and a check for  at the bottom of the order form leonard wrote in  harrier jet in the item column and  in the total points column in a letter accompanying his submission leonard stated that the check was to purchase additional pepsi points expressly for obtaining a new harrier jet as advertised in your pepsi stuff commercial pepsi rejected leonards submission and returned the check pepsi explained that “the item that you have requested is not part of the pepsi stuff collection it is not included in the catalogue or on the order form and only catalogue merchandise can be redeemed under this program the harrier jet in the pepsi commercial is fanciful and is simply included to create a humorous and entertaining ad we apologize for any misunderstanding or confusion that you may have experienced and are enclosing some free product coupons for your use” leonard’s lawyer responded to pepsi by writing “your letter is totally unacceptable we have reviewed the video tape of the pepsi stuff commercial  and it clearly offers the new harrier jet for  pepsi points our client followed your rules explicitlythis is a formal demand that you honor your commitment and make immediate arrangements to transfer the new harrier jet to our client if we do not receive transfer instructions within ten  business days of the date of this letter you will leave us no choice but to file an appropriate action against pepsi” pepsi refused to honor the letter and leonard filed suit against them to force them to give him a harrier jet     pm cancel update description additional comments cancel update comments additional comments rubric                 cant change a rubric once youve started using it

leonard matte jersey bell sleeve tunic     disapointment while i love the look fit and feel of this top all it does is pill it is to the point after  wearings that it can only be worn under something else it looks so bad   perfect cut tunic love love love it the cut is absolutely perfect and i love the fabric very soft knit i ordered my usual size small in the purple the color is gorgeous i went back and ordered the teal which i received yesterday and love it as well i hesitated to ordervthevteal because it looked like a not particularly pretty shade of blue on my ipad however it really is a lovely teal in person highly recommend  lovely bell sleeved blouse yet this bell sleeve does not get in the way as many with such sleeves can the perfect arm length mine in the xxs  lbs  got the spotted color and is great with both my black and or brown slacksjeans this can look good with any combo of styling very nice fit just as in description would love to get in more colors if they become available again even if is a returned itemworth the price  so comfortable this is exceptionally made comfortable and can transform from day to night i love the ease of care and no iron  this is a keeper i received this tunic and i love it i am  and a size  i ordered a size large and it fits but its not tight i have a muffin top  this tunic glides over it instead of drawing attention to it the bottom comes down over my butt  it has side slits to help women with hips the material is soft and  feels good the sleeves are a little long but i have that problem with most long sleeve tops i will hem the sleeves about  inch  it will be fine cant wait to wear this to work or with jeans  boots thanks qvc  nina leonard  disappointed after asking a few questions online about this top i decided to place my order i received my qvc package today and was very disappointed when i saw the top first of all i am calling this item a top and not a tunic because it is clearly not a tunic a tunic usually covers some of your backside this top fell to the top of my hips the reviews i read before ordering stated the bell sleeves are long and come down to the middle of the hand that was not my case at all the sleeves did not even come to my wrist back to the drawing board for me i would love to find a tunic that i can wear with my skinny jeans and leggings anyone have any suggestions dont waste your money on this one  above average tunic the bell sleeves give this tunic that extra bit of added interest the fit and fabric are perfect got the solid teal and the solid purple and will be wearing them alone under jacketssweaters and vests these tunics can be worn in a casual or dressy way  love i love this top i ordered the black and giraffe i love the bell sleeves and the material i am going to order the leopard print one please make more colors and prints  love it very nicely made tunic the fabric is just the right weight for the shape of the garment and it isnt too lightweight or doesnt weigh you down when you wear it it is true to size and the sleeves are not too long or too bell shaped the design is different which is a nice change from the same old same old longsleeved black tops and tunics  nice fit i ordered the purple and it is a beautiful deep color the fit is nice love the bell sleeves im  and the sleeve length is good the only reason its not a  star for me is it will show bumps and lumps ie your pant button i would recommend smooth front pants great with leggings  beautiful shirt i absolutely love this shirt especially the bell sleeves i think its very sexy i received the purple and now im ordering the black the fabric glides over your body and feels great love it  great top got this in leopard and it is darling the sleeves are flowy and fabulous and i can wear this with jeans and boots on a saturday or with a black skirt and heels to work returned the purple as it was a bit bold for my taste ive already washed it and it washesdries easily  a perfect
