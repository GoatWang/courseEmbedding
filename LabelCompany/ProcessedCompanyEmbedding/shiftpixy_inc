materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forwardlooking statements you are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business financial condition and results of operations and prospects overview the company is a leading provider of employment law compliance solutions for employers and workers in an environment in which shift or other parttimetemporary positions commonly called gigs are performed in what is now being called the gig economy businesses such as those in our current target market in the restaurant and hospitality industries contract with independent workers for less than fulltime engagements primarily in the form of shift work the trend toward a gig economy has begun and we are endeavoring to participate through an employment related service offering a study by intuit predicted that by   percent of american workers would be less than full time independent contractors intuit inc october  intuit  report twenty trends that will shape the next decade a significant problem for employers in the gig economy involves compliance with regulations imposed by federal state and local governments including requirements associated with workers compensation insurance and other traditional employment compliance issues including the employer mandate provisions of the aca the compliance challenges are often complicated by the actions of many employers in reducing workers hours as a means to avoid characterizing employees as fulltime congress is considering amendments to or replacement of the aca as of the date of this filing the aca has not been formally amended or repealed employers still face regulatory issues and overhead costs including those associated with the employer mandate provisions of the aca for which we believe our services are a costeffective solution table of contents for gigshift workers whom we also call shifters the significant problem is difficulty in finding other jobsgigs to replace hours lost when their employers reduce their hours and make them less than fulltime employees or otherwise to fill workweek employment voids we believe shiftpixy has the ideal solution for both of these groups and each of their problems via a service offering that entails two principal elements that we refer to collectively as our ecosystem as follows  shiftpixy employer solution shiftpixy absorbs the employers shifters as shiftpixy employees and makes those employees available to the former employer to work the same jobs as employees of shiftpixy shouldering a substantial portion of the employmentrelated compliance responsibilities in addition when the shiftpixy mobile app is released businesses will be able to access via that technology additional qualified workers who are already part of the shiftpixy ecosystem to fill workforce voids on short notice having assurance that such employees have work experience will be paid will be covered by applicable workers compensation coverage will have applicable employment related taxes calculated and processed  shiftpixy shifter solution shifters placed with one of shiftpixys clients can now access other shift work with other shiftpixy clients ultimately through the new shiftpixy mobile app a prototype of which was released in september  when released to the general public anticipated to be in the fourth quarter of  the shiftpixy mobile app will enable not only shiftpixy shift employees but also ultimately shift employees outside the shiftpixy ecosystem many of them millennials who connect to the outside world solely through mobile devices to access available shift jobs at all of shiftpixys participating clients in addition to the benefits of working not as independent contractors but as employees enjoying the protections of workers compensation coverage and employment laws as well as the calculation and remittance of applicable employment taxes among other benefits shifters are also enabled to participate in shiftpixys benefit plan offerings including minimum essential health insurance coverage plans and a k plan shiftpixys headquarters is currently situated in irvine california from which it can reach the southern california market and has a modest staff in phoenix but it plans to open the following additional physical offices over the course of the next several years potentially in the following order  first new york and then orlando  next after the above offices are operational and upon securing additional financing if necessary we plan to proceed to dallas and then chicago  finally after all the above offices are operational and upon securing additional financing if necessary we plan to proceed to las vegas and then atlanta through these office locations we plan to engage more actively with clients through sales marketing employee onboarding training and payroll processing in each instance as necessary and appropriate to the applicable market these markets collectively account for or allow us to cover approximately  of our target market in the restauranthospitality sectors us department of labor bureau of labor statistics may  occupational employment and wages table of contents shiftpixy and its subsidiary collectively serve as of may   an aggregate of approximately  clients with an aggregate of approximately  active paid worksite employees as well as providing only payroll administration services to an additional  clients with  employees none of these clients represents more than  of our annualized revenues for the three or nine months periods ending may   shiftpixys anticipated business and revenue growth will result from the following factors  large potential market  the burdens placed on employers with over  fulltime employees under the aca  marketing advantages from strategic insurance provider relationships  new shiftpixy mobile app that is designed to provide additional benefits to employers and shift workers  ultimate development of a shiftpixy ecosystem  mitigation of employment law compliance risks the problem employment law compliance requirements present a multiobstacle ridden employment related compliance landscape for our target market of businesses that rely significantly on parttime and temporary workers challenges facing such businesses include the need to secure applicable workers compensation insurance coverage to effect employment related tax withholdings and filings and to navigate laws related to hiring and release of employees including discrimination race color national origin sex age religion disability pregnancy and sexual orientation sexual harassment sick pay and time off hours of work minimum wage and overtime gender pay differentials immigration safety child labor military leave garnishment and other wage imposition processing family and medical leave cobra and unemployment claims aca compliance currently adds another significant burden to businesses with more than  fulltime workers as they try to manage the additional burdens associated with mandated health insurance benefits a business can secure assistance in mitigating and even eliminating these challenges by retaining shiftpixy the shiftpixy solution shiftpixy is developing an ecosystem comprised of a closed proprietary operating and processing system that helps restaurant or hospitality businesses and in the future businesses in additional industries wherein we plan to market our services as well as shift workers by matching available shifts with available shift workers the shiftpixy ecosystem provides the following benefits  compliance  cost containment  cost savings shift human capital management inc we formed shift human capital management inc a whollyowned subsidiary in december  we formed this subsidiary in response to the need to have workers compensation policies

when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the companys management in consultation with its legal counsel as appropriate assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company in consultation with legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein if the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the companys financial statements if the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed loss contingencies considered remote are generally not

aca compliance shiftpixy™ revolutionizes the gig economy structure irvine ca – june   –shiftpixy inc is currently offering to help fellow employers use innovative solutions to avoid the many burdens created by the affordable care act providing unique insurance products regulatory compliance services and proprietary human administration tools shiftpixy also lends out their private variable workforces to third party employers that have been forced to reduce the size of their organizations “shiftpixy not the employer retains the workforce known as ‘shifters’ all administrative and regulatory matters that accompany the hiring of shifters is handled by shiftpixy totally removing that burden from its contract employers under shiftpixy’s tutelage these employers get the benefit of having a workforce without the regulatory burdens that normally accompany the hiring of that workforce the employer gets to maintain workforce levels while providing shifters the opportunity to receive ‘full time’ revenues and healthcare coverage” states scott absher ceo shiftpixy inc “the affordable care act is affecting personnel decisions a survey of more than  small business owners by the society for human resource management found that  of companies surveyed reported they have cut the number of workers they employ employers are not required to offer coverage for employees who work less than  hours per week a related study found that  of employers’ nationwide are planning to reduce workers’ hours as a result of the aca by making the shifters into shiftpixy employees we can now lend them out to the third party employers who are in need of additional workers” continues absher shiftpixy has reported filing a reg a the new sec regulatory vehicle that allows nonaccredited

mobile application shift workers or “shifters” can find shift opportunities within their skill set and geographic range and pick unfilled shifts when they need the work shiftpixy processes the entire workflow on the provider side from offering open shifts approving a shifter based on their rich profile to processing the entire payroll insurance and regulatory demands for each shift hour worked helping employers in helping employers take care of their employees we could see changes and decisions for employers that were resulting in fewer hours for shift workers but leaving gaps or holes in employers’ schedules shiftpixy’s solution shiftpixy was designed to sync work opportunities from job providers with the open time slots of available shift workers shiftpixy manages relationships with job providers to take open shift opportunities that are filling their schedules and offer them as work opportunities to qualified workers without the formal job interview and commitments the shiftpixy app allows shift workers to enroll profile and prequalify based on their work and training experience for open shift opportunities  “shifters” can earn provider specific qualifications to boost their

structure by creating its own proprietary workforce to lend out to third party employers jun    et from shiftpixy inc irvine california june   prnewswire  the shiftpixy solution allows employers who choose to reduce employee work hours as their default option to avoid mandated regulatory costs and related burdens gives them the ability to maintain workforce levels while providing employees opportunity to receive full time wages and healthcare coverage shiftpixy management explains why they believe that the company has the potential to significantly increase revenues in the future shiftpixy has filed a regulation a offering circular with the sec will use a new sec regulatory framework that allows nonaccredited investors the opportunity to invest in sec registered a ipo offerings  shiftpixy inc shiftpixy® or the company a disruptive next gen gig economy provider of unique insurance products regulatory compliance services proprietary human administration tools and variable labor force provider announced the initial rollout of its business model in southern california  building upon this success the company plans to release a new application in early september  that will enable unemployed underemployed or parttime andor fulltime individuals in the nations restaurant and hospitality industry workforce and ultimately in all business workforce to apply for variable shift work from businesses in their local market appropriately this proprietary app is planned for release on labor day  the company saw that the affordable care act aca while solving problems also inadvertently opened up a whole new market for labor services… and the company also saw that the shortcomings in the much hyped new class of the service industry the gig economy was not the way to tap into this vast new market the gig economy is a service industry where workers are expected to operate like minibusinesses the influence of these kinds of service industry companies is growing according to an analysis by greylock partners the value of transactions over platforms such as car services lyft and uber grocery delivery service instacart and courier service postmates could grow as large as  billion this year scott w absher shiftpixy founder  ceo said as technology has advanced over the past decade new internetbased employment platforms emerged which are often referred to collectively as the gig economy many of these platforms such as uber transportation and instacart grocery delivery regularly engage contract workers rather than employees for jobs gigs among other reasons this classification allows companies like uber to operate with  to  less in labor costs than the competitionleading to eyepopping numbers like ubers  billion valuation or instacarts latest  million round of funding many fear the loss of the gig workforce structure either by a wave of classaction lawsuits intervention by regulators or through the collective action of disgruntled workers and the gig economy may be in serious jeopardy httpwwwfastcompanycomthegigeconomywontlastbecauseitsbeingsuedtodeath shiftpixys evolution of the classic gig model totally eliminates this key weakness in the standard model of treating workers as independent contractors shiftpixy has embraced the next gen structure for the gig economy by making their workers shiftpixy calls them shifters employees of shiftpixy and lending them out to third party employers in need of additional workers the employers get the benefit of having a workforce without the compliance and regulatory burdens that normally accompany their hiring of a regular workforce particularly ones that exist in industries with many parttimeshift workers such as the restaurant and hospitality industries shiftpixys initial target market shiftpixy and not the operating business is the entity that employs these shifters and handles aca and other administrative and regulatory compliance matters that accompany the hiring of employees shiftpixy totally removes that burden from its operating business clients the need for the services the company offers is an unintended result of and has been amplified by the compliance burdens placed upon employers of gig economy workers under the affordable care act aca shiftpixy recognized this need early on and saw it as an opportunity as shown by the studies below the acas new compulsory insurance requirements for us business owners has caused companies to reduce the number of hours worked by employees as their default solution  however that left them with a need for additional workers to fill the void as a result employers require a greater number of employees who are each working fewer hours than before… and shift workers now need more opportunities to work for different companies in order to maintain their income level absher added the affordable care act is affecting personnel decisions a survey of more than  small business owners by the society for human resource management found that  of companies surveyed reported they have cut the number of workers they employ employers are not required to offer coverage for employees who work less than  hours per week a related study found that  of employers nationwide plan to reduce workers hours as a result of aca  httpwwwncpaorgpubst one direct casualty of aca has been the shift worker with full time employment with one employer becoming a thing of the past as employers dropped hours and shifts to bring their business into aca compliance by having less than  full time employees  full time employees not only include traditional full time workers working more than  hours per week but also requires employers to make complex calculations involving all part time workers to make sure they dont have part time workers constituting equivalent full time employees there are approximately  million part time workers in the united state said absher of these more than  million people are classified as involuntary parttime workers meaning that they would have preferred fulltime employment but were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a fulltime job  httpwwwblsgovnewsreleasearchivesempsitpdf on the other side of the table due to aca in order not to be subject to aca insurance mandates job providers now had to have more people working fewer hours the company has seen that race to meet the new demands and covering new gaps are stressing small business as never before in the us the new demands have made delivery and cash flows challenging for small employers who provide most of the us employment scott w absher cofounder  ceo added we have seen that the race to meet the new demands and covering new regulatory requirement gaps are stressing small business as never before the new demands have made compliance staffing and cash flows more challenging for small employers who provide most of the us employment to address these widespread pain points shiftpixy has established a unique and what we believe are a highly desirable suite of services that merge insurance coverage access operational compliance and financial support along with intermediation of shift workers and available shifts at participating businesses one valuable aspect of shiftpixys services to employers is access to a large pool of qualified shift workers that are part of the companys proprietary ecosystem many of these shifters will come into the ecosystem through their current employers who become shiftpixy clients thus making shiftpixy the employer of record for their workers the company intends to add to the shiftpixy ecosystem others seeking employment but not working for shiftpixy employers from company marketing initiatives focused on continuously expanding the pool of available shift workers initially from the new mobile app the company will offer in september  these activities will give employers a greater incentive to become shiftpixy clients by making available to them a greater number of qualified local shift workers to fill available shifts through marketing to potential shifters outside the ecosystem will occur simultaneously with onboarding additional shifters via new employer enrollment with shiftpixy shiftpixy will initially target the restaurant and hotel industries a market comprised of  million workers management has also identified several additional markets such as new york chicago dallas and orlando where shiftpixy may in the future target for marketing through what it will promote as bringing the same high value type services to these industries as it is now bringing to the restaurant and hospitality industries shiftpixy is already generating significant revenue and has the realistic potential to achieve what few startups can in a short period of time  generate significant annual revenues asher added management has leveraged its expertise and long standing market alliances within the property and casualty producer community to assemble a large backlog of potential provider clients for what we believe to be the companys unique platform and programs shiftpixy now is in the position of being able to select rather than inviting provider clients into its proprietary program which we believe will enable shiftpixy to grow more rapidly and select clients that may add more profitably to our operations absher added we call a prospective employee a shifter we have designed our shiftpixy mobile app to be the primary entrance into the shiftpixy ecosystem for a shifter who was not an employee of an company that became a shiftpixy client the user experience on this app is being designed to provide a simple mobile access and opportunity management tool for shifters to select and manage their shift opportunities shiftpixy intends to collect nominal monthly user fees from shifter participation in the shiftpixy ecosystem via this app the shiftpixy app will also serve as a gateway for shifters to access perks and benefits an employee of a large company would enjoy these perks may include health dental and vision coverages k or ira access and a variety of discounts media expenditures are planned to support the launch of the mobile shifter access application additionally the companys electronic marketing plan focuses on generating message buzz around the aca enforcement actions we expect in  will show up in the form of penalties in  for the unprepared employers of  these penalties are steep potentially in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more and we expect will gain a great deal of national attention when this happens the company intends to produce a significant volume of publicity around the shiftpixy compliance solution within the trade and financial media to attempt to attract additional clients shiftpixys planned bb digital message program will track hot subject matter surrounding aca enforcement and compliance and produce additional content we will use to elevate shiftpixy as an innovative employer solution to these aca problems the company also reported that it has filed with the sec an offering circular on form a under new regulation a this new sec regulation allows not only just wealthy accredited or institutional investors but also nonaccredited investors… everyday people…

compulsory insurance markets and new compliance requirements for us businesses where statutory requirements for business owners collide with extremely limited access to the required insurance coverage particularly health care insurance coverage and related regulatory compliance issues shiftpixy management has leveraged over  years of experience in developing and marketing alternative risk programs to address unique business insurance needs into the delivery of a unique and what we believe to be a highly desirable suite of services to merge coverage access with operational compliance and financial support shiftpixys management team discovered that recent new demands due to the affordable care act aca were forcing a new compliance layer into the marketplace for our existing and potential provider clients which we were forced to aid in addressing for them due to the compliance and risk areas of expertise that were core to our client delivery mastery of an effective solution such as the one we have developed has become essential in the work to master and incorporate a means to effectively address the new aca compliance demands as part of our core service platform we observed that shift work was now very vulnerable the direct casualty of aca was the shift worker who is now seeing full time employment with one employer becoming a thing of the past as small employers dropped hours and shifts to bring their business into aca compliance the shift worker has now become part of the underemployed and forgotten millions in the us economy one the other side of the aca impact were the job providers who now had to have more people working fewer hours the race to meet the new demands and covering new gaps are stressing small business as never before in the us the new demands have made delivery and cash flows challenging for small employers who provide most of the us employment  shiftpixy management realized that they were in the prefect position to intermediate a better solution to meet the needs on both the provider and shift worker sides of the new next gen labor reality in the us shiftpixy has developed proprietary technology and client engagement processes that enable the company create high value on both the employer and the employee sides of the us shift work chasm when launched in september the shiftpixy mobile app allows available and qualified shift workers to connect with immediately available shifts from participating shiftpixy provider clients through a simple mobile application shift workers or shifters can find shift opportunities within their skill set and geographic range and pick up available shifts when they need the work shiftpixy processes the entire workflow on the provider side from offering open shifts approving a shifter based on their rich profile to processing all of the payroll insurance and regulatory demands for each shift hour worked the shiftpixy provider platform secures and monetizes longterm provider client relationships under annual agreements which are not passive or transactional but active and vital to our clients success our product suite is designed to meet critical operational and financial needs and are specifically focused to exploit what we see as the current market weakness with our goal of placing our value proposition very high with the provider clients we target the shiftpixy shifter platform secures and monetizes individuals seeking shift work based on need and availability matched to their specific skills and within their geographic range on a monthly fee basis for access shiftpixy management has leveraged not only its expertise but also its longstanding market alliances within the property and casualty producer community to assemble a very large backlog of provider clients anxious for the planned launch of our unique platform and programs the company has the unique position of allowing rather than inviting provider clients into its proprietary program which allows shiftpixy to grow rapidly and select provider clients profitably our goal for our small business provider client business owners is to liberate them to do what they do best provide high quality service to their customers our dedication and mastery of the dailies for our provider clients and ability to guide through small course corrections keep our provider clients on a path free of surprises or risks from failure to attend to and cure small issues before they take root and grow to expensive obstacles to the growth of the business the resultant freedom our provider clients find now allows them to dedicate their focus to the growth of their business these are truly liberating tools for small business owners on many significant business and personal levels shiftpixys primary client provider service engagement is contractual and allows client providers coverage access operational and processing bandwidth from which we extract regular residual fee income monthly management is developing other high value touch points designed to strengthen and further monetize these provider client engagements shifter user engagements will be monetized by charging for the services but keep the charges at low levels intended to drive mobile app utilization and community growth through not only shift access and opportunity management but personal access to perks an employee of a large corporation might enjoy due to the shiftpixy economy of scale for more information on shiftpixy please visit the companys website at httpwwwshiftpixycom shiftpixy has
