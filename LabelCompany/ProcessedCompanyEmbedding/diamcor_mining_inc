exploration overview diamcor focuses on the identification acquisition and operation of nearterm production based diamond projects which demonstrate the potential to generate sustained diamond production and cash flow diamcors experienced management and operational team have a proven history of successful project operation on a  basis in south africa the companys production based focus is a clear and intended deviation from the typical highrisk exploration focus aimed at the discovery and establishment of new kimberlite diamond mines instead diamcor focuses on acquiring projects which deal with the processing of tailings reserves using modern technologies some tailings reserves in sa are approaching  years old andor the very careful selection of quality alluvial and eluvial projects which allow for the recoveries of documented diamondiferous gravels using simple low cost stripmining types of operations both project types have the potential to achieve sustained diamond production with short leadtimes to that production many industry experts agree that when the growing demands from emerging markets of china and india are combined with economic recoveries around the world there will be a significant shortfall in the current known world wide diamond productions abilities to meet those demands receive updates copyright  diamcor mining inc home     about diamcor
