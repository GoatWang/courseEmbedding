 denver co  october   dear mr eves – thank you for taking the time to send boulder voters a letter detailing xcel energy’s opposition to ballot measures b and c i typically don’t send letters of thanks to those who waste ink  paper to fill my mailbox with threats pseudotruths  baseless supposition however as a previously undecided voter on the question your note helped me cast my vote in favor of bc this afternoon without trepidation now mr eves i appreciate that as an officer of xcel energy you are dutybound to act in the interest of your shareholders but that does not absolve you of the responsibility to be upfront with your customers or afford you license to play fast  loose with the truth your claims that b and c necessarily incur or somehow constitute a “hostile condemnation process in the courts” involving “years of litigation” are simply not true – they are baseless supposition at best in fact i see the situation as quite the opposite xcel controls whether this process would go smoothly or be mired by what you describe as “litigation and uncertainty” simply by the level of cooperation the public service company of colorado psco exhibits or chooses not to in divesting distribution  generation assets at a fair market value or on the other hand psco has sole discretion in making these threats a reality by acting in a retaliatory manner by inflating sale prices throwing forth technical barriers and complicating demarcation to try and retain control of grid assets or mire the municipalization process in costs delays and negative press however that or any other red herring – be it costs xcel’s claimed progress towards renewables or fancy glossy marketing materials  slogans from xcel aren’t what cast my ballot for me these are all distracting accoutrement adorning the core of the issue xcel energy is responsible by nature to its shareholders and the profit motive intrinsically there is nothing wrong with this notion in fact as a shareholder of many corporations former employee of a major corporation and a founder of my own i truly appreciate that idea but i also appreciate the deeper implications it has for energy policy in boulder i’m not interested in the fancy portmanteau named programs xcel has touted as “innovative” in renewable capacity many of which were done in part or in whole to meet state or federal mandated generationmix or cleanair requirements i might add i’m also not convinced by xcel’s claims graphs and thick glossystock printed collateral boasting a “proven track record” in renewable energy instead as an astute investor businessman and shareholder i’m particularly swayed by certain facts gleaned from your annual report balance sheet and investments which frankly speak louder to the issues than any letter you might send my way speaking directly to facts that xcel has largely kept off their talking points prompter on the issue for obvious reasons anyway you slice it xcel is “big coal” and has not been “responsible” by boulder customers let alone nature xcel’s  sec k filing demonstrates that the psco enjoyed a  improvement in diluted earnings per share of course the informed voter will not be surprised that this is the case since xcel fought for and was awarded the nation’s nd highest electrical rate increase  in  the story becomes even more sordid when you recall that the primary justification for this rate increase to the puc was a  billion expenditure to construct the brandnew comanche  coalfired plant and the conversion of a former nuclear facility to fossilfuel based generation this is not the picture of the clean and renewablecentric xcel your corporation has spent millions trying to portray is it there are so many more examples of how the entire gamut of xcel’s asset mix investment posture and business model demonstrate that xcel is neither committed to renewables nor interested in any other goal than protecting their profit motive and their shareholders’ pecuniary interest either in boulder in the psco or across their entire portfolio of businesses distribution infrastructure or generating capacity in reality the facts and history confirm an even more disappointing outcome xcel and the psco will act in its own pecuniary interest and do only what they must when their feet are held to the coal fire to demonstrate a token shift to renewables and not only do they remain firmly encamped in coal country but they continue to lay deeper foundations there too but i won’t waste your time or any more paper waxing poetic about the story the actual numbers tell themselves i’ll believe an audited k filing over glossy inserts in my xcel billfrom an xcel funded pac any day by the way instead i’ll leave you with this thought after being bullied  threatened by your letter and the various “citizens groups” xcel has funded to the tune of nearly  at last count – the number invariably will continue to tick upwards in the final days of the campaign i’m left with solid confirmation that our energy future is not wellcared for in your hands and should not be in the hands of your corporation xcel’s values  conduct in the past decade in how it has done business and more recently with how it has approached the bc question has given me pause and reason to be excited to see even an inefficient bumbling and slow government entity take the reins although i truly believe the city of boulder can do much better than that and isn’t nearly as incompetent has xcel has painted them to be again mr eves thank you for clearing the air on these ballot issues – it helped me do something “responsible by nature” and vote to find a way to put more naturally responsible leadership in place for my utility needs sincerely basit mustafa boulder co meter ba rate
