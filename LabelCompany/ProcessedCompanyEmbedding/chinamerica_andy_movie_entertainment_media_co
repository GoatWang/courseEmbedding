operating performance our overall business strategy and our earnings for the periods covered general chinamerica andy movie entertainment media co formally known as court document services inc is an operating company that is focusing its efforts in movie projects including preproduction research and strategizing introduction of american talent and potential partners from hollywood california we are seeking to provide training and global market consulting production and postproduction activities and particularly the distribution and promotion in the united states market we have an operating history and have generated revenues that have produced both net incomes and losses in the periods in which we have been fully operational we are currently in discussion with parties to begin preproduction on a project utilizing facilities that are already in production mode we are looking to establish a came presence in hengdian china which is deemed to be the hollywood of china our president is working to secure a new location in building  f hengdian industrial park for movie and tv businesses hengdian zhejiang province china mr fan travels in various parts china extensively for both business and pleasure and has been working on securing the new location our board of directors believes that we can operate as a movie entertainment media and documentary production company during the next twelve months to increase revenues for the company however the production of a movie documentary or animated film may take years to complete and future cash flows if any are impossible to predict at this time the value of any revenue and potential profits from any production or animated film is largely dependent on factors beyond our control such as the market for our films we may raise cash from sources other than our operations our only other source for cash at this time is investment by others in the company subsequent events  new business on december   chinamerica andy

account for the benefit of chinamerica under our management agreement employees as of december   there were no paid employees this includes our officers and director who run the corporation critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results could differ from those estimates to be as accurate with our estimates as possible we use our historical data to forecast our future results deviations from our projections are addressed when our financials are reviewed on a monthly basis this allows us to be proactive in our approach to managing our business it also allows us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions regarding our estimates management does not believe that our actual results are related to any sensitivity in estimates made by management the yearend consistency of our results has shown that our prior years historical data is the best projector of our future results income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes codified primarily in fasb asc topic  income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes codified primarily in fasb asc topic  income taxes fin  provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation

we continue to focus on developing operations in the peoples republic of china operating expenses expenses were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   this difference is primarily due to a change in operations and all expenses for the year ended december   were attributable to discontinued operations our current expenses are directly attributable to our

on developing operations in the peoples republic of china net income loss as a result of the factors described above we show a net loss of  for the year ended december   we believe the loss from

movie and tv businesses hengdian zhejiang province china management believes that with the new contract agreement between came and zhong mei yin shi we will begin to see an increase in expenses

regarding accounting standards codification  asc  to address topics related to the film entertainment industry as modern films today can cost and return revenues in the millions of dollars each one needs to be accounted for with care further as there are a multitude of ways films are distributed today different rules may apply as to when revenue may be recognized for each the company may enter into arrangements with third parties to coproduce many of its theatrical productions these arrangements which are referred to as cofinancing arrangements take various forms the parties to these arrangements could include studio and nonstudio entities both domestic and foreign in several of these agreements other parties control certain distribution rights the filmed entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film asset acquired in these transactions the substance of these arrangements is that the thirdparty investors own an interest in the film and therefore receive a participation based on the respective thirdparty investors interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  entertainmentfilms asc
