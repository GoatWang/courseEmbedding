burlington ma read his story × as a health coach what makes me happiest is developing a relationship with my patients i love watching them grow supporting them when they need to be supported and letting them go when it’s time helping people change for the better feels amazing getting to know my patients is key to this job with gideon it’s so much more than setting goals for his weight it’s understanding what else is happening in his life — like his new marriage or the stress of hour weeks as a carpenter — so we can tackle it together i want my patients to see it’s okay to say ‘i need help’ as health coaches we’re here for the physical needs but also for their mental and social health i always wanted to be a doctor as a kid but now i truly feel like i have my dream job see more stories ▶ it’s a whole new patient experience iora changes primary care as we know it our care team which includes a dedicated advocate for each patient works together to treat the whole person we see people when they’re sick but also when they’re well so that we can keep them healthy here the environment is caring and patients have a voice it’s our job to give them everything they need to live happier and healthier lives our medical team empowers the individual a team of a doctor nurse and a health coach works with each person we set goals with the patients enabling them to become active participants in their own wellbeing we know people by name but more importantly by their dreams fears and challenges health coaches are the connection our health coaches are relationship builders between the patients and their care teams they are screened and hired for their ability to connect deeply with people because our health coaches are more than caregivers they are confidants cheerleaders and friends fully integrating behavioral health we believe it’s easier for patients to manage their lives when mental health is also prioritized and seen as integral to one’s overall health at iora our patients can access their own behavioral health specialist in the comfort and privacy of their doctors’ office our specialists provide shortterm counseling assessments and referrals as well as consultation to other team members all within the scope of primary care our technology is inspired by our care most medical record systems prioritize billing first patients second ours is designed around patients period we created our collaborative care platform to support caring for the whole person and we’re always improving it based on feedback from our care teams and their patients — recent updates include patient access to their own records and a place to share notes we’ve also built a tool to manage not only an individual’s health but an entire population’s   say goodbye to paying by transaction doing the right thing for our patients extends to our payment model too we’ve moved away from a transactionbased model to one based on care now care teams are free to do what’s best to treat our patients rather than what the system deems reimbursable because not all aspects of caring have a billing code we find partners that make it happen for our model to work we need partners who share our belief in a better way to take care of people together we open practices understanding that high quality primary care is the solution for happier healthier and more engaged patients and in the long run this is what leads to lower costs learn more news blog patients contact us privacy policy notice of non discrimination back to top about us  iora health toggle navigation

relationship with my patients i love watching them grow supporting them when they need to be supported and letting them go when it’s time helping people change for the better feels amazing getting to know my patients is key to this job with gideon it’s so much more than setting goals for his weight it’s understanding what else is happening in his life — like his new marriage or the stress of hour weeks as a carpenter — so we can tackle it together i want my patients to see it’s okay to say ‘i need help’ as health coaches we’re here for the physical needs but also for their mental and social health i always wanted to be a doctor as a kid but now i truly feel like i have my dream job see more stories ▶ it’s a whole new patient experience iora changes primary care as we know it our care team which includes a dedicated advocate for each patient works together to treat the whole person we see people when they’re sick but also when they’re well so that we can keep them healthy here the environment is caring and patients have a voice it’s our job to give them everything they need to live happier and healthier lives our medical team empowers the individual a team of a doctor nurse and a health coach works with each person we set goals with the patients enabling them to become active participants in their own wellbeing we know people by name but more importantly by their dreams fears and challenges health coaches are the connection our health coaches are relationship builders between the patients and their care teams they are screened and hired for their ability to connect deeply with people because our health coaches are more than caregivers they are confidants cheerleaders and friends fully integrating behavioral health we believe it’s easier for patients to manage their lives when mental health is also prioritized and seen as integral to one’s overall health at iora our patients can access their own behavioral health specialist in the comfort and privacy of their doctors’ office our specialists provide shortterm counseling assessments and referrals as well as consultation to other team members all within the scope of primary care our technology is inspired by our care most medical record systems prioritize billing first patients second ours is designed around patients period we created our collaborative care platform to support caring for the whole person and we’re always improving it based on feedback from our care teams and their patients — recent updates include patient access to their own records and a place to share notes we’ve also built a tool to manage not only an individual’s health but an entire population’s   say goodbye to paying by transaction doing the right thing for our patients extends to our payment model too we’ve moved away from a transactionbased model to one based on care now care teams are free to do what’s best to treat our patients rather than what the system deems reimbursable because not all aspects of caring have a billing code we find partners that make it happen for our model to work we need partners who share our belief in a better way to take care of people together we open practices understanding that high quality primary care is the solution for happier healthier and more engaged patients and in the long run this is what leads to lower costs learn more news blog patients contact
