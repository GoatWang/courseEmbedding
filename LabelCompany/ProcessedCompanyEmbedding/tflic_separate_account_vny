the prospectus for the advisor�s edge� ny variable annuity dated may�   total annual separate account expenses shown  apply to the annual stepup to age  death benefit option this reflects a fee that

riders to the policy are available that provide optional benefits that are not described in detail in this prospectus there are additional fees each year for those riders �  the fee is a percentage of the total withdrawal base the total withdrawal base on the rider date is the policy value less any premium enhancement if the rider is added in the first policy year after the rider date the total withdrawal base is equal to the total withdrawal base on the rider date plus subsequent premium payments less subsequent total withdrawal base adjustments the next item shows the lowest and highest

policy date and may not be later than the last day of the month following the month in which the annuitant attains age  �  the following hereby amends the prospectus architect guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit you may elect to purchase the optional architect guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit which provides you with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit if you invest subject to specified equity limits �glwb� in certain designated investment choices this rider is available during the accumulation phase the architect glwb may vary for certain policies and may not be available for all policies please contact us at � for additional information regarding the availability of the architect glwb in addition the tax rules for qualified policies may limit the value of this rider please consult a qualified tax advisor before electing the architect glwb for a qualified policy architect glwb this benefit is intended to provide a level of cash withdrawals regardless of the performance of the designated investment choices you select if you elect this benefit we will provide a maximum annual withdrawal amount regardless of your policy value your ability to change the frequency or amount of your withdrawal ceases if your policy value reaches zero under this benefit you can withdraw up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount each calendar year starting with the calendar year immediately following the annuitant�s th birthday and lasting until the annuitant�s or the annuitant�s surviving spouse if the joint life option is elected death unless your total withdrawal base is reduced to zero because of �excess withdrawals� see total withdrawal base adjustments below all withdrawals before the annuitant or the annuitant�s surviving spouse if the joint life option is elected is  are excess withdrawals a penalty tax may be assessed on amounts withdrawn from the policy before the owner reaches age � example assume you are the owner and annuitant and you make a single premium payment of  when you are  years old further assume that you do not make any additional withdrawals or premium payments but that after ten years your policy value has declined to  solely because of negative investment performance you could withdraw up to  which is the applicable income benefit percentage of �multiplied by the total withdrawal base of  each calendar year for the rest of your life assuming that you take your first withdrawal when you are age  �  and that you do not withdraw more than the maximum annual withdrawal amount in any one year of course you can always withdraw an amount up to your policy value pursuant to your rights under the policy at your discretion example continued assume the same facts as above but you withdraw  when you are  years old that excess withdrawal decreases your future maximum annual withdrawal amount to  see the sai for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail �  please note � � � � any withdrawal in excess of the maximum withdrawal amount in any calendar year is an excess withdrawal � � � � an excess withdrawal will impact the maximum annual withdrawal amount and the total withdrawal base on a greater than dollarfordollar basis like all withdrawals withdrawals under this benefit also � � � � reduce your policy value � � � � reduce your base policy death benefit and other benefits � � � � may be subject to income taxes and federal tax penalties and � � � � may be limited or restricted under certain qualified policies maximum annual withdrawal amount you can withdraw up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount in any calendar year without causing an excess withdrawal see �total withdrawal base adjustments� below the maximum annual withdrawal amount is zero if the annuitant is not  years old on the rider date ie the date the rider is issued and remains zero until the first day of the calendar year after the annuitant�s th birthday if the annuitant is at least  years old on the rider date the maximum annual withdrawal amount in the calendar year during which the rider is elected is equal to the income benefit percentage of the total withdrawal base prorated based on the number of days from the rider date to the end of the calendar year thereafter the maximum annual withdrawal amount for each subsequent calendar year is equal to the income benefit percentage see below of the total withdrawal base for qualified policies if the plan participant generally the annuitant is at least  � years old the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that calendar year and each subsequent calendar year is equal to the greater of � � � � the maximum annual withdrawal amount described above or � � � � an amount equal to a minimum required distribution amount calculated using only �the living annuitant�s age �the irs uniform lifetime table or if applicable the joint life and survivor expectancy table �the policy value of the base policy including the present value of any additional benefits provided under the policy to the extent required to be taken into account under irs guidance and �amounts from the current calendar year no carryover from past years an amount not calculated as set forth above cannot be used as the maximum annual withdrawal amount once your policy value reaches zero by a combination of nonexcess withdrawals andor negative performance you cannot make premium payments and all other policy features benefits and guarantees except those provided by this rider are terminated in order to receive withdrawals guaranteed by this rider after your policy value reaches zero you must select the frequency of future withdrawals once selected the amount and frequency of future withdrawals after your policy value reaches zero cannot be changed please note � � � � the maximum annual withdrawal amount described above is based on calendar years not rider or policy years � � � � the maximum annual withdrawal amount is not cumulative amounts not withdrawn in one calendar year are not carried over to the next or any subsequent calendar year ie your maximum annual withdrawal amount is not twice as high the next year �  � � � if the rider is added prior to the annuitant�s th birthday the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be zero until the beginning of the calendar year january st after the annuitant�s th birthday however you will still be charged a rider fee prior to this time � � � � excess withdrawals may cause you to lose the benefit of the rider � � � � all policy value must be allocated to a limited number of specified funds see �designated investment choices� below income benefit percentage we use the income benefit percentage to calculate the maximum annual withdrawal amount the income benefit percentage is determined by the annuitant�s age at the time of the first withdrawal taken on or after the january�st immediately following the annuitant�s th birthday or if the joint life option is elected the th birthday of the younger of the annuitant or the annuitant�s spouse the income benefit percentage is as follows � age�at�time�of first�withdrawal �� income�benefit percentage  ��   ��   ��   ��   ��   ��   ��   ��  � ��  please note that once established at the time of the first withdrawal on or after the january�st immediately following the th birthday of the annuitant or if the joint life option is elected of the younger of the annuitant or the annuitant�s spouse the income benefit percentage will not increase even though the annuitant�s age increases total withdrawal base we use the total withdrawal base to calculate the maximum annual withdrawal amount the total withdrawal base on the rider date is the policy value after the rider date the total withdrawal base is equal to the total withdrawal base on the rider date plus subsequent premium payments less subsequent total withdrawal base adjustments total withdrawal base adjustments gross partial withdrawals up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount that are made in a single calendar year will not reduce the total withdrawal base gross partial withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount that are made in a single calendar year �excess withdrawals� will reduce the total withdrawal base on the date of the withdrawal by the greater of the dollar amount of the excess withdrawal or a pro rata amount in proportion to the reduction in the policy value possibly to zero see the sai for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail including an excess withdrawal that reduces the total withdrawal base by a pro rata amount excess withdrawals may eliminate any guarantee offered by this rider �  please note � � � � the total withdrawal base is generally equal to the policy value on the rider date consequently purchasing this rider after the policy issue date may result in a smaller maximum annual withdrawal amount if the policy value decreases prior to the rider date than what it would have been had the rider been purchased on the policy issue date � � � � upon the death of the annuitant the architect glwb terminates

maximum equity percentage discussed below or to any other subaccount within  days after the first rider anniversary ie the anniversary of the rider date you can terminate this rider terminating the rider will result in losing all your benefits under this rider starting the next business day you may transfer to a nondesignated choice maximum equity percentage you select either the   or  maximum equity percentage at the time you elect the architect glwb your equity percentage is equal to the policy value in all �equity� investment choices divided by the total policy value asset rebalancing monthly asset rebalancing is required at all times while the architect glwb is in effect your asset rebalancing equity percentage cannot exceed your maximum equity percentage if asset rebalancing is discontinued if the asset rebalancing equity percentage exceeds the maximum equity percentage or if you make a transfer which causes your policy equity percentage to exceed your maximum equity percentage then we will notify you of your failure to comply you will have  days from the date we mail the notice to fix the problem or your rider will terminate �  upgrades you can upgrade the total withdrawal base to the policy value after the first rider anniversary by sending us written notice we reserve the right to limit your upgrade election to a day period following each rider anniversary as long as you are younger than the maximum rider issue age at this time the minimum remaining withdrawal amount and maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated if an upgrade is elected your current rider will terminate and a new rider will be issued with a new rider date and its own rider fee percentage which may be higher than your current rider fee percentage and growth rate if any the new rider date will be the date the company receives all necessary information please note � � � � even if the rider fee percentage does not increase the charge for the rider will increase because it would be based on a higher total withdrawal base � � � � if you upgrade while you are receiving systematic payouts of the maximum annual withdrawal amount the dollar amount of the systematic payout of the maximum annual withdrawal amount after the upgrade may decrease for the reminder of the calendar year even though the total withdrawal base increases this is generally because the maximum annual withdrawal amount for the remainder of the calendar year is calculated based on the remaining partial year and the systematic payout is calculated on a yearly basis annuitization if you have reached your maximum annuitization date we will allow you to annuitize your policy and elect to receive lifetime annuity payments equal to your maximum annual withdrawal amount architect glwb � joint life option if you elect the architect glwb you can also elect to postpone termination of the rider until the later of the annuitant or annuitant�s spouse�s death this allows the maximum annual withdrawal amount to be withdrawn until the death of the later of the annuitant or annuitant�s spouse if the annuitant�s spouse continues the policy please note � � � � the annuitant�s spouse must be either a joint owner along with the annuitant or the sole primary beneficiary and there is no joint owner if you elect this option � � � � if at the time of the annuitant�s death the spouse cannot continue to keep the policy in force under the tax code then the rider will terminate and no additional withdrawals under the rider are permitted � � � � the annuitant�s spouse for purposes of this rider cannot be changed �  architect glwb fee a rider fee which is a percentage of the total withdrawal base on each rider anniversary is charged annually prior to annuitization the percentage depends on the maximum equity percentage that you select and on whether you select the joint life option the rider fee percentages are � maximum equity percentage �� single�life�option �� joint�life�option  ��  ��   ��  ��   ��  ��  we will also deduct the rider fee pro rata upon full surrender of the policy or other termination of the rider the rider fee is deducted from each investment choice in proportion to

state law � � � � the annuitant is also an owner except in the case of nonnatural owners � � � � there are no more than two owners and � � � � if the joint life option is elected the annuitant�s spouse is not yet age  lower if required by state law and �a joint owner along with the annuitant or �the sole primary beneficiary and there is no joint owner termination the architect glwb and any

following text replaces the definition of annuity commencement date in the statement of additional information annuity commencement date � the date upon which annuity payments are to commence this date may be any date at least one year after the policy date and may not be later than the last day of the policy month following the month in which the annuitant attains age  except expressly allowed by tflic the following disclosure is hereby added to the statement of additional information architect guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit total withdrawal base adjustments total withdrawal base gross partial withdrawals up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount that are made in a single calendar year will not reduce the total withdrawal base gross partial withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount that are made in a single calendar year will reduce the total withdrawal base by an amount equal to the greater of �  the excess gross partial withdrawal amount and �  a pro rata amount the result of a  b  c where � � a is the excess gross partial withdrawal the amount in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount remaining prior to the withdrawal � � b is the policy value after the maximum annual withdrawal amount has been withdrawn but prior to the withdrawal of the excess amount and � � c is the total withdrawal base prior to the withdrawal of the excess amount the following demonstrates on a purely hypothetical basis the effects of partial withdrawals under the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit when a withdrawal is taken two parts of the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit can be affected �  total withdrawal base �twb� �  maximum annual withdrawal amount �mawa� this supplement must be accompanied or preceded by the statement of additional information for the advisor�s edge� ny variable annuity dated may�  example  �nonexcess� withdrawal assumptions � you  owner and annuitant or younger of annuitant and annuitant�s spouse if joint life option is elected for additional cost age  on rider issue age  at time withdrawals begin which means the income benefit percentage is  twb at rider issue   twb at time withdrawals begin    withdrawal �wd� beginning  years from the rider date would be   of the thencurrent  total withdrawal base � wd   excess withdrawal �ewd�  none policy value �pv�  �������� in  years is any portion of the withdrawal greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount no there is no excess withdrawal under the guarantee if no more than  is withdrawn result in this example because no portion of the withdrawal was in excess of  the total withdrawal base does not change example  excess withdrawal assumptions � you  owner and annuitant or younger of annuitant and annuitant�s spouse if joint life option is elected for additional cost age  on rider issue age  at time withdrawals begin which means the income benefit percentage is  twb at rider issue   twb at time withdrawals begin    wd beginning  years from the rider date would be   of the thencurrent  total withdrawal base � wd   ewd      pv   in  years is any portion of the total withdrawal greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount yes      the excess withdrawal amount note for the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit because there was an excess withdrawal amount the total withdrawal base needs to be adjusted and a new lower maximum annual withdrawal amount must be computed had the withdrawal for this example not been more than  the total withdrawal base would remain at  and the maximum annual withdrawal amount would be  however because an excess withdrawal has been taken the total withdrawal base and consequently the maximum annual withdrawal amount will decline �  new total withdrawal base step one the total withdrawal base is reduced by the amount of the excess withdrawal or the pro rata amount if greater step two calculate how much the total withdrawal base is affected by the excess withdrawal �  the formula is ewd  pv �  wd  twb before any adjustments �           step three which is larger the actual  excess withdrawal amount or the  pro rata amount  pro rata amount step four what is the new total withdrawal base upon which the maximum annual withdrawal amount is based      result the new total withdrawal base is  new maximum annual withdrawal amount because the total withdrawal base was adjusted as a result of the excess withdrawal we have to calculate a new maximum annual withdrawal amount that will be available starting on the next january�st this calculation assumes no more activity prior to the next january�st step one what is the new maximum annual withdrawal amount  the adjusted total withdrawal base     � result going forward the maximum you can take out in a year is
