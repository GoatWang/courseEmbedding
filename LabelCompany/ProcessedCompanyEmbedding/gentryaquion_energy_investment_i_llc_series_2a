0 by anya litvak  pittsburgh postgazette tweet email related media austrian firm positions itself to buy aquion energy at auction for m lawsuit claims bankrupt aquion energy fired workers without notice after a bankruptcy auction where four bidders vied for battery maker aquion energy inc an entity called julinetitans llc had the winning  million bid the firm which registered in delaware on may  is an affiliate of the china titans energy technology group according to bloomberg titans is an investment holdings company that “engages in research development manufacture and sale of electric products and equipment” in china aquion the lawrencevillebased saltwater battery manufacturer filed for bankruptcy in march after a decade of raking in silicon valley bonefides and capital it was scheduled to go before a bankruptcy judge wednesday afternoon seeking to certify the sale enpower energy corp ltd  a chinese battery firm underbid titans by 00 an austrian firm called bluesky energy that once sold aquion’s batteries had served as the socalled stalking horse bidder setting a floor of about  million the sale makes it very likely that aquion’s technology will be leaving pennsylvania in the next few months according to conditions negotiated in the purchase contract it appears aquion will be evacuating its large manufacturing space at the former sony corp plant in mount pleasant as well as its other locations in belle vernon and lawrenceville the contract does require titans to offer jobs to at least  aquion employees up from two in a previous version of the purchase contract when bluesky was the stalking horse bidder in march aquion said it laid off more than  workers leaving  of its fulltime employees and kept  on as consultants during the bankruptcy process finding a market aquion got its start during a time when money for clean energy technology flowed freely said reed mcmanigle senior manager at carnegie mellon university’s center for technology transfer and enterprise creation now a startup like aquion might have to trudge through small government research grants but 0 years ago enthusiasm for clean tech was driven in part by the expectations of a more aggressive shift away from fossil fuels than has materialized it didn’t hurt that aquion’s technology was developed at cmu by jay whitacre whose ideas are now roaming the surface of mars in the rover curiosity “they started out of the gate with significant money” mr mcmanigle said in total aquion raised 0 million in equity documents show but by late last year aquion found it couldn’t raise any more money to stay afloat “energy was big a decade ago” mr mcmanigle said “but more recently people recognize what a challenge it is to bring any technology to market and lots of investors don’t have that kind of patience” perhaps a bigger issue was that in recent years the price of aquion’s chief competitor the lithiumion battery fell dramatically as production ramped up in 0 when aquion hired eric hittinger an assistant professor of public policy at the rochester institute of technology to build a model of a microgrid so it could test its competitiveness against lithiumion batteries mr hittinger said aquion’s batteries came out as the cheaper alternative he suspects that if he ran the same experiment today lithiumion would come out ahead mr hittinger knows aquion well mr whitacre was mr hittinger’s thesis adviser at cmu his take on the bankruptcy is this “they were actually a bunch of really good people and made pretty smart decisions and the market just basically got away from them” as lithiumion batteries made advances in the market cheap shale gas also made the search for effective energy storage less urgent mr hittinger said while aquion’s technology found an enthusiastic if limited market in residential and small commercial applications — paired with solar panels for example as an off grid solution — the company kept pushing into the utility space utilities are interested in energy storage in part to supply power at peak times without having to build more power plants that would sit dormant most of the year aquion had several pilot projects with utilities including one with exelon corp whose venture capital arm constellation technology venture was an investor in the battery firm some experts have suggested that aquion’s batteries aren’t wellsuited for this function lithiumion batteries can pump out a lot of power all at once supplying a jolt to the grid each time that happens the battery loses a bit of its life a fan but a realistic one aquion’s batteries discharge more gradually but they last a lot longer explained nick dizon president of nidon clean energy in oahu mr dizon has been selling aquion’s batteries for three years he still monitors some of the homes and commercial buildings he’s taken off the grid with aquion’s products since 0 and reports he’s never had a problem with the batteries and hasn’t seen any appreciable loss of life in them as a standalone solution for utilities he said the batteries aren’t the best fit mr dizon is quick to shower aquion with superlatives and he plans to keep installing its batteries until the inventory runs dry in hopes that the company will be reconstituted and start manufacturing once again he believes so much in aquion’s technology that the company had potential investors and prospective buyers call him he’s spoken with french petrochemical giant total whose venture capital arm invested in the battery company in 0 and shortly after the bankruptcy filing he talked to germany chemical company basf about aquion’s batteries “but i was honest to the investors” he said “people don’t know how to sell them they won’t understand why this thing is far more valuable than any other battery on the market” expenses outpacing sales in the end aquion said it couldn’t rack up enough orders to keep pace with its expenses in part that’s because the company grew so quickly and started largescale manufacturing earlier than many startups are able to do “the only way to see how cheap you can make something is to build a gigantic factory” mr hittinger said “and of course the downside of this is you need to figure out how to sell that much product” aquion’s clients and some industry observers cautioned that the company’s trajectory while dramatic isn’t an indictment of its technology whose promise was using common environmentally friendly materials sometimes mr mcmanigle said “even when startups fail they can be viewed as successes from the perspective of the new people who came to pittsburgh and then move to another local company “and the increased pool of people who have taken the entrepreneurial plunge and are wiser for their next effort” he said anya litvak
