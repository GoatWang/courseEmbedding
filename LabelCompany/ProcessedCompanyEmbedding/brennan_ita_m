jayshree jayshree ullal  arista networks inc thank you charles thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for the first quarter of  earnings call i am pleased to report that we had a pretty good quarter given our normal seasonality we demonstrated our predictable and profitable growth with nongaap revenue of  million as we grew  year over year nongaap earnings per share were  with an operating margin of  services contribution was higher at  of overall sales from a geographic perspective our customers in the americas contributed  of total revenue while the rest of our international theaters progressed steadily in the quarter we delivered nongaap gross margins of  in our highly dynamic and competitive industry our top  customers included four verticals namely our cloud titans our cloud specialty and service providers and financial services our new customer acquisition continues to be healthy made up mostly of leading hightech enterprise customers in terms of new introductions for the quarter we began the year in february of  with the introduction of arista data analyzers short for danz danz is a programmable statedriven data analysis architecture and software bringing the next frontier of network packet broker telemetry danz in  is supported in aristas popular  and r leaf series as well as r universal spine and this coupled with cloudvision telemetry offerings delivering anytoany mirroring of network traffic up to gigabit line rates this is a compelling advantage of x to x over standalone products this includes highperformance hybrid mode operation with traffic capture analysis filtering all in a compact footprint with low power and cost savings this quarter we also announced the certification of aristas  series from the joint interoperability test command jitc for inclusion in us department of defense dod approved product indiscernible  at aristas  analyst day on march  in our headquarters we unveiled a gamechanging containerization architecture the arista ceos this containerized extensible operating system provides controls across the server network as containers leveraging the mechanisms of our statedriven networkwide database netdb customers can now deploy eos natively as a containerized application where ceos supports multifaceted use cases including natively hosting containers to create applicationspecific customizations network functionality between virtual machine servers and containerized applications and the simulation of  large networks for their behavior under load ceos was also demonstrated as the march ocp event with microsoft sonic our launch of ceos really underpins our continued differentiation in cloud networking based on five a principles available architecture to deliver a selfhealing highquality aperture for data across a highly resilient leafspine network agile workx delivering microservices for bare metal compute or new workloads such as containers work streams like video or workflow for storage automation to rapidly provision a modern software infrastructure for the agile deployment in minutes rather than hours or days analytics tracing deeply the workflow to quickly pinpoint problems through our tracer technology for dynamic telemetry and finally any api cloud whereby the state of the network via arista netdb and open apis offers public private and hybrid cloud access with our rich partner ecosystem as i reflect upon  and our start i am pleased with aristas performance and trajectory arista has restored the majority of its lead times as we are now in mainstream production across both our domestic and international manufacturing sites we continue to invest in cultivating key talent retaining our engineering groups to that end im also pleased to welcome john mccool as our new chief platform officer for platform hardware engineering and manufacturing operations john has worked closely with both andy and myself for over three decades as a trusted industry executive in this newly created role john will be one of our key assets on the technical leadership team complementing our already strong anchors andy bechtolsheim our chief development officer and chairman ken duda our founder and software senior vice president and chief technology officer and anshul sadana our chief customer officer with that i will now turn it to ita our cfo for q  financial details ita m brennan  arista networks inc thanks jayshree and good afternoon this analysis of our q results and our guidance for q  is based on nongaap and excludes all noncash stockbased compensation expenses and legal costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits a full reconciliation of our selected gaap to nongaap results is provided in our earnings release total gaap revenues in q were  million up  year over year and above our guidance of  million to  million demand in the quarter remained strong reflecting continued broadbased adoption of our products service revenues represented approximately  of revenue up from  last quarter international revenues came in at  million or  of total revenue down from  in the prior quarter we remain focused on expanding our international footprint but you should expect our geographical revenue mix to fluctuate on a quarteroverquarter basis depending on the timing of us and international deployments overall gross margin in q was  down slightly from last quarter at  and favorable to the midpoint of our guidance of  to  this improvement versus guidance primarily reflected a higher than expected consumption of components sourced internationally during a previously open importation window operating expenses for the quarter came in at  million up  from last quarter rd spending returned to a more typical  of revenue for the period up from  last quarter this reflects expected increases in prototype and nre spending and continued head count growth sales and marketing expense remained at approximately  of revenues down slightly from last quarter our operating income for the quarter was  million or  of revenue other income and expense for the quarter was a favorable  million and our effective tax rate was  resulting in net income for the quarter of  million or  our diluted share number for the quarter was  million shares resulting in a diluted earnings per share number of  up  from the prior year the significant increase in the diluted shares in the quarter was primarily related to the adoption of asu  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting this guidance removes the excess tax benefit on sharebased awards from the diluted share calculation reducing the assumed shares to be repurchased under the treasury stock method this resulted in a oneoff step function increase in our diluted share count of approximately  million shares this increase in share count is recorded on a gaap and nongaap basis and reduced our nongaap eps for the quarter by approximately  those of you who focus on our gaap financials will note that we recorded a gaap income tax benefit of  million in the quarter the adoption of asu  also resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits on sharebased awards as a reduction to the gaap provision for income taxes this benefit however is excluded from the nongaap financials as it relates to stockbased compensation amounts legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits came in at  million for the quarter just below our outlook of  million on the last earnings call as a reminder these expenses are excluded from the nongaap results discussed above now turning to the balance sheet cash cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately  billion we generated  million of cash from operations in the march quarter this reflects strong net income performance combined with growth in productrelated deferred revenue offset by an increase in supply chain related working capital dsos came in at  days down from  days in q this improvement primarily reflects strong collections in the quarter inventory turns were  times down from  in q inventory increased to  million in the quarter up from  million in the prior period this reflects growth in both the raw material and finished goods level and is in line with our strategy of continuing to invest in supply chain related working capital where appropriate in addition consistent with last quarter we maintained a further  million of inventory deposits recorded in other assets at the end of the quarter you should expect to see us continued to scale these working capital investments over the coming quarter our deferred revenue balance was  million up from  million in q this balance continues to be made of short and longterm service contracts and productrelated deferrals associated with acceptance terms and future deliverables accounts payable days were  days down from  days in q reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments capital expenditures for the quarter were  million now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and beyond were pleased with our continued strong execution in the quarter with revenues and earnings per share up more than  on a yearoveryear basis the fundamentals of the business remain strong and we are seeing broadbased demand for our products across the customer base operationally we have continued to ramp volumes at our us contract manufacturer and believe we now have the capacity to support the us customer base from this site in addition we have worked to solidify our us supply chain and while we believe this will help ensure availability of supply it would likely also result in a more consistent use of usbased sourcing over the coming quarters with this as a backdrop our guidance for the second quarter which is based on nongaap results and excludes any noncash stockbased compensation expenses and any legal expenses associated with the ongoing lawsuits is as follows revenues of approximately  million to  million gross margin of approximately  to  operating margin of approximately  our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately  with diluted shares of approximately  million please note that based on our current outlook we expect costs associated with the ongoing lawsuits to be approximately  million finally we just received the commissions ruling on the  case included in this ruling was a requirement that arista establish a bond to cover the importation and sale of products and related subcomponents subject to the orders during the twomonth presidential review period we currently believe that the maximum payment required under this provision will be approximately  million we intend to record this penalty as an operating expense in the gaap income statement and will to exclude it from our nongaap financials given its nonrecurring in nature as a reminder all of these lawsuitrelated costs are excluded in the second quarter nongaap outlook that we provided above i will now turn the call back to charles charles charles yager  arista networks inc thank you ita we are now going to move to the qa portion of the arista earnings call due to time constraints id like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the qa portion of the arista earnings call which also includes marc taxay aristas senior vice president and general counsel and mark foss aristas senior vice president for global operations and marketing your first question comes from the line of jess lubert from wells fargo securities your line is open jess lubert  wells fargo securities llc thanks for taking my question and congrats on another nice quarter i wanted to actually try and squeeze two in here but first just on the outlook it appears that your first half  revenue has a chance to actually accelerate year over year so i guess i just want to understand the breadth and the strength to what degree theres been any pullforwarded business if theres any reason to expect less than seasonal trends during the second half of the year and then the second question i think were likely to get a final determination on the  case tonight so i just was hoping you could update us on where you are in the process of developing workarounds for the patents in that case and if theyll be submitted and embedded within eos sometime soon thanks jayshree ullal  arista networks inc hi jess well try and answer one question which one jess lubert  wells fargo securities llc i guess just the business and the revenue outlook seasonality in the second half and hopefully someone else will follow up on the  case and the workarounds jayshree ullal  arista networks inc you gave them a question to ask i appreciate it thank you ill get through as many of them as possible so i think i said were feeling very good both about the q guidance weve given and in general our customers acceptance of our products as ive often shared with you visibility in the long term is always hard with our cloud customers but in general their spending pattern continues and their investment in capex in the foreseeable future i cant speak to q but i think we can look into the summer and say the trends continue like were seeing in q and our guidance for q i think in general what arista is experiencing here on one hand its unique because were such a strong supplier in cloud networking on the other hand its also a strong reflection of our innovation and investment in our new products and our new product uptake has been particularly strong it was strong in q where it was more than  of our revenue and it continues to be strong and stronger in q as well and i expect that to continue in the second half too operator your next question comes from the line of jeff kvaal from nomura instinet your line is open jeffrey thomas kvaal  nomura  instinet thanks very much and let me follow up on jesss question a bit and that is could you perhaps jayshree talk a little bit about the market segmentation you have changed your terminology a little bit and then you talked about service provider this quarter is that linked to the acceleration in revenues that youve been able to post over the last few quarters thank you jayshree ullal  arista networks inc sure as some of you who were with us at analyst day may recall arista has really now started talking about five verticals not four there are the cloud titans which tend to be our largest customers who are deploying over  million servers theres a new category of tier  or cloud specialty providers who could emerge to be cloud titans in the future that are making heavy investments in the cloud space and expect to be public and perhaps hybrid cloud providers the service providers which is really the classic definition of service providers tier  tier  tier  the financial services and rest of enterprise that tends to be highly adoptive all five sectors generally contribute doubledigit percentages to aristas verticals and mark foss do you want to add something more to that mark foss  arista networks inc sure we dont usually give out specific breakdowns of the five segments but we can rank them in terms of the order size for q so in terms of size the cloud titans was the number one segment for q number two was the service provider segment number three was the cloud specialty provider segment number four was the rest of enterprise and last but not least the fifth one was the financial services vertical operator your next question comes from the line of mark moskowitz from barclays your line is open daniel gaide  barclays capital inc guys this is dan gaide for mark so you just mentioned that – or can you just talk about balancing the percent of components that youre going to be sourcing internationally and domestically and just how that impacts gross margin guide thank you ita m brennan  arista networks inc yes dan i think very consistent with the dialogue that weve had over the last while weve got a gross margin range of  to  and weve always commented that in a world where were using a balanced mix of components from the us and from overseas that we would be in the middle of that range so that lines up nicely with our guidance of  to  so i think nothing new or different from what weve been saying on the gross margin front we just see ourselves operating in that kind of balanced mix environment over the next coming quarters operator your next question comes from the line of mark kelleher from da davidson your line is open mark kelleher  d a davidson  co great thanks for taking the question im going to follow up on that a little bit maybe you can give a little more puts and calls on your inventory during the quarter i know the window was closed for most of it you were sourcing from overseas but the previous quarter you built a lot of inventory in the quarter should we expect a little bit lower on your gross margin range because of that inventory when the window was closed and what are you expecting going forward are you still going to source internally jayshree ullal  arista networks inc i think it still comes back to that concept of having a mixed balance of sourcing from us component drivers and then some components that will come out of inventory so we very consciously put the infrastructure in place that we have us manufacturing us sourcing and were going to be leveraging that plus any inventory that we have so i think nothing new nothing different here mark kelleher  d a davidson  co so the window opening and closing doesnt matter really to you jayshree ullal  arista networks inc obviously at this point you can see the inventory that we have and well continue to leverage that mark kelleher  d a davidson  co okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of steve milunovich from ubs your line is open steven milunovich  ubs securities llc thank you could you comment on your microsoft business in terms of either growth this quarter or growth you expect for the year hp lost their server business there and one potential read is that microsoft is just slowing their procurement generally speaking are you seeing any of that jayshree ullal  arista networks inc hi steve microsoft as a customer continues to be one of our top customers their business with us is strong as ive always commented it would be difficult to expect them to be the same customer concentration as they were last year which was i think  but a good guess is they will be in the  to  range this year steven milunovich  ubs securities llc thanks operator your next question comes from the line of simon leopold from raymond james your line is open victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc hi guys this is victor chiu in for simon i wanted to ask you about some potential shifts possibly in the competitive landscape because juniper has reported several quarters in a row now doubledigit switching growth and then just recently they started breaking out the contributions from their cloud customers and that vertical implying that theyre making progress there and thats starting to become a more important vertical for them so i just wanted to ask if youve seen them more so than you have in the past and then maybe just quickly viceversa how your progress is with your routing platform jayshree ullal  arista networks inc no theyre both good questions thank you victor we do not see any dramatic change in competitive pressures our dominant competitor continues to be cisco we do see juniper in the service provider sector specifically when we are competing in routing as you know theyre quite strong there but no major change there expect our entry into routing has therefore made juniper more visible for us in routing victor w chiu  raymond james  associates inc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of hendi susanto from gabelli  company your line is open hendi susanto  gresearch llc hi jayshree hp is planning to shift away from its core legacy network products to selling arista would you be able to share what our expectations should be on the partnership and whether or not it has fully ramped up at the moment jayshree ullal  arista networks inc thank you hendi as i said before we have very strong executive involvement from both the ceo of hpe meg whitman and the executive vice president antonio neri and mutual commitment to the partnership continues to be strong but i think both companies would like to see more progress here and are still in the very early stages of this engagement as ive always said i expect to see better results in the second half of  and  and both teams are working hard to streamline the training the process the channels and the customer reach so were doing a lot of work but the real results of this will be more apparent in  and  hendi susanto  gresearch llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vijay bhagavath from deutsche bank your line is open vijay bhagavath  deutsche bank securities inc thanks hi jayshree ita you had solid results here my question is on the r the routing portfolio we have heard you have over  customers for the r so it would be very helpful to know are there any specific use cases in routing or end customer segments in cloud that this product is seeing demand and roughly what percentage of those plus customers are in product acceleration mode versus more in field trials thanks jayshree ullal  arista networks inc thanks vijay i expect to see  routing customers by this summer so were making very good progress to that i would say we are over north of  of that goal this is both the r series as well as the r so both products and generally we classify it with the flexroute license in terms of use cases i think the biggest difference here is arista is not a legacy router company and what were seeing is a lot of routing capabilities where most service providers are transforming from traditional traffic engineered routers to resemble more the cloud so the cloud network aggregation and core for both ethernet and ip is changing dramatically especially with the migration in their backbones and migration to mobile g as well as were seeing a lot of content delivery networks and peering use cases so i would say the new norm for sp networks is cloud networking and thats where arista is particularly shining and is bringing out its cloud heritage for routing vijay bhagavath  deutsche bank securities inc perfect thank you operator your next question comes from the line of paul silverstein from cowen  company your line is open fahad najam  cowen  co llc hi this is fahad in for paul one quick question on your deferred revenue is up very nicely can you help us understand whats going on there and then a bigger broader question for you jayshree from here on what are the greatest opportunities you see from here and what are the biggest risks ita m brennan  arista networks inc ill take the deferred revenue one quickly first the growth youre seeing is partly just growth in services renewals based on the installed base and then we did see some increase also in product deferred and again thats purely driven by the timing of shipments where we have acceptances or features that we need to deliver in the future so again nothing unusual there its just the normal ebb and flow of the business that happens to result in that growth in this quarter jayshree do you want to take the jayshree ullal  arista networks inc no i think you answered the question well thanks operator your next question comes from the line of simona jankowski from goldman sachs your line is open simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co yes hi thank you i just wanted to follow up i think ita i heard you mentioned that you just received the  ruling other than the up to  million bond can you just tell us a little more about what was in the ruling ita m brennan  arista networks inc marc do you want to take that marc taxay  arista networks inc sure id be happy to take that one so as ita said we did just receive the product termination notice we actually havent received the written opinion yet were going to get that tomorrow so well know more once we actually get the opinion but what we know today is that the icc found that we infringed two out of the six patents that were asserted in that case one is the  patent and the other is the  patent we obviously were very glad that the commission sided with us on four out of the six but disappointed about the other two as ita also said there was  bond that was stated in there and i think we explained that and at this stage we really just need to take a look through the decision to see how it impacts our goforward strategy simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co thank you operator your next question comes from the line of james faucette from morgan stanley your line is open james e faucette  morgan stanley  co llc thank you very much i wanted to ask about the opportunity within cloud titans jayshree you talked about we should expect microsoft maybe to come down a little bit at least as a percentage of revenue how do you see your opportunities more broadly and over the long run there do you feel like containerized eos opens up a lot of incremental opportunity within the cloud titans and i guess over the medium to long run do you think that cloud titans will remain your biggest market vertical or is there a point in which you think that others can overtake it thanks jayshree ullal  arista networks inc sure thanks james i think the cloud titans will always remain a big vertical whether it will be the biggest or not will depend on how the other verticals perform in the cloud space theres no doubt in anyones mind that workloads are moving to the cloud and companies like amazon azure google platforms i dont know i can list them all out for you are doing very very well but so are the next tiers so i think there will be many consumption models in the cloud and many customers of ours will be successful depending on the vertical stack or offerings they have they may be different shapes and forms of clouds so that brings me to your real question the heart of your question is what about containerized eos today its really an architecture and a technology for a handful of very sophisticated customers these customers basically will be looking for different consumption models and if you take an example like ive often shared on microsoft they have several tiers of leaf and several tiers of spine and they may use our containerized eos in some use cases and applications to the leaf but they may choose to keep the spine highly no pun intended selfcontained and well defined as it is now so we dont expect massive shifts to containerized eos in the near term but we do expect containerized eos to be an important consumption and packaging model for our cloud customers and sophisticated developers operator your next question comes from the line of rod hall from jpmorgan your line is open rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc hi guys thanks for the question i just wanted to follow up again on the  ruling the  and  patents can you guys comment on workarounds and just timeline on that or should we be expecting the timeline to flow the same way that  did and is there a possibility this all is done by the end of this year thanks jayshree ullal  arista networks inc thanks rod ill let marc answer it but i think having been through this experience once with  we are more comfortable and familiar with the process as well as you are so i think it will be very similar we fully expect to have software and possibly hardware workarounds depending around the details once we read the patent and it will be a process that tends to take six to  months is that about right marc marc taxay  arista networks inc thats right jayshree ullal  arista networks inc i think we wont know more  until we read more closely so more as we know more rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks jayshree operator your next question comes from the line of kulbinder garcha from credit suisse your line is open kulbinder s garcha  credit suisse securities usa llc thank you for the question jayshree its a question on your cloud titans business when i looked at and based upon the charts you gave at the analyst meeting it looks like the next five customers whoever they are are probably collectively still smaller than microsoft im just looking at that youve had business with them all dealings i think for three or four years so how does that market penetration relative to microsoft being it just takes this long and is the opportunity ahead of you or is the footprint and the opportunity there just a little bit smaller than maybe three or four or a few years ago just any commentary around the cloud titans would you expect for example this year to grow faster than your overall company average jayshree ullal  arista networks inc okay thanks kulbinder ill try and process your questions there were multiple subplots in that question first of all the cloud titans are healthy theyre doing well and i think theyll continue to do well many of these cloud titans we have now worked with an average of three to five years so they know us were intimate with them theyve operationalized us the cloud specialty providers and the service providers both those are new categories who could potentially spend like the cloud titans but were anywhere from our first year to third year with them so arista are much newer to them and they to us so depending on their success and where theyre trying to be successful i think they could be very large customers for us perhaps even as large as some of the cloud titans but they just arent as far enough along with us or we with them so i think kulbinder s garcha  credit suisse securities usa llc i guess jayshree my point is just in the cloud titans not in either of the specialty providers just in the cloud titans microsoft youre doing very well with all of the rest of them the five or so customers that are in there i guess arent as big as the microsoft business yet despite you having business with those five customers for a number of years so im talking about that specific opportunity has that taken longer to penetrate than you thought jayshree ullal  arista networks inc no so ill leave it at this several of them are in our top  customers so theyre doing quite well for us but it is fair to say that of all the cloud titans microsoft is doing better than any of the others for us and perhaps even in the industry they and amazon lead everyone so i think youre just seeing the reflection of the industry trends on arista customer trends kulbinder s garcha  credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you jayshree ullal  arista networks inc sure operator your next question comes from the line of stanley kovler from citi research your line is open stanley kovler  citigroup global markets inc yes thank you i just wanted to ask a question about linearity in the first half of the year it seems like youre benefiting from a little bit of pentup demand and your lead times have come in now with the backdrop of q as we think about the rest of the year there are going to be other demands for some of your customers as they begin to potentially shift spending to servers and those product cycles can you help us understand the ebb and flow of spending in the data center that you expect to impact between the serverstorage and networking as we get through the year with some of the competing product cycles there that they have funds for thank you jayshree ullal  arista networks inc sure stanley first of all we probably dont see the ebb and flows youre describing between serverstorage as a purchase segment versus networking at any given time the networking component of our total data center is  to  so the server and the storage is significantly higher so we tend to have networking operational experts who plan the networking piece so therefore how it ties into ebbs and flows the server and the storage spend usually occurs at or before the network comes in thats how we have really seen it and therefore the tie is more loosely coupled than youre stating in terms of lead times our lead times have become very predictable right now so customers are able to plan better and certainly they work with us on anything they need in the next and the forthcoming quarter but anything beyond  weeks is difficult for us to get visibility from them on and also for their planning they have to plan on that since some of our lead time components are that far out so i would say one or two quarters and generally  weeks is a good boundary condition for how they plan operator your next question comes from the line of erik suppiger from jmp securities your line is open erik l suppiger  jmp securities llc hi congrats on a good quarter can you comment on the danz product did you see that gain momentum in the quarter and you said that your advantage is x to x is that based on a cost advantage you can provide the customer or can you discuss that in a little detail jayshree ullal  arista networks inc sure so we introduced the danz in february and its based on our new products the r the r as well as the ongoing support weve had on danz in  the reception has been very good its only been a quarter since we introduced the new features but i will tell you similar to routing i expect to see  new customers in the first year of danz however the size of these deals vary depending on how much monitoring functionality they need in a small use case versus cap aggregation at gigabit ethernet type of capabilities in a larger scale use case so were seeing both so in terms of competitive advantages were not trying to build cap aggregation as a sole monitoring product our emphasis is clearly high port density the ability to run in switching mode in parallel so that customers can mix and match switching and danz in a common chassis and routing in some cases as well as the footprint and power and pricecost capability so all of that is factoring into the x to x depending on which metric im looking at the customers are very pleased with our systemwide focus of not just how do we do danz but how do we do danz with our leafspine networking portfolio operator your next question comes from the line of ittai kidron from oppenheimer your line is open ittai kidron  oppenheimer  co inc thank you congratulations on a great quarter a clarification and a question for me the clarification when you say  from new products can you just mention what those new products you include in that category and then the question ita your shortterm deferred has doubled in two quarters doubled its a little bit hard to think how growth in services contracts can really make up for that big of a jump so clearly a lot of customers – or very few customers are putting a lot of money up front with you is there any color you can give us that helps us profile those customers or the type of the use cases or the products for which these orders are going forward is there any way you could give us some color on whats being built up there that would be great ita m brennan  arista networks inc yes you guys clearly services is a piece of this we have seen the product deferred grow some of it is linked to the new products and just an increase in the number of customers who have some acceptance terms around those new products and the rest of it really is timing and timing of shipments in the quarter if you look at the mix of customers in that group its across the customer base theres nothing particular to any one of the verticals that mark and jayshree talked about earlier it really is more tactical and in a lot of cases in terms of new products have an acceptance clause and then depending on when you ship that determines what that balance is so the balance is cycling as you go quarter to quarter and it really is just a question of what do we ship and how do we ship in the quarter and how much of it ends up going to those customers and ending up in the deferred so i still encourage everybody to think about it more as a tactical balance as opposed to something thats strategically reflecting some shift at this point ittai kidron  oppenheimer  co inc okay and what is included in the category of new products ita m brennan  arista networks inc the rseries routing products jayshree ullal  arista networks inc the r and the r are the primary ones ittai kidron  oppenheimer  co inc very good good luck ladies ita m brennan  arista networks inc okay thanks ittai jayshree ullal  arista networks inc thank you it isnt often you get to say congrats to ladies only operator your next question comes from the line of jason ader from william blair your line is open jason n ader  william blair  co llc hello i just wanted to follow up on the deferred revenues ittai asked about the jump that youve had ita what should we expect in the second half for deferred revenues after the strength that youve seen over the last couple quarters should we expect the deferred revenue balance to continue to grow at the same rate ita m brennan  arista networks inc im not going to try to guide the deferred revenue balance its tough enough to guide the revenues i think as we see some of the new products become more mature thats when we may see some decline on that but again in the context of at least on our current guidance were not factoring that in so i know its interesting and intriguing but really it is more tactical in terms of whats in that balance so it will move around and again i wouldnt read too much into it jason n ader  william blair  co llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of aaron rakers from stifel your line is open aaron rakers  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes thank you for taking the question and also congratulations ladies i hate to do this but im going to go back to the deferred discussion i think as we look forward and you see the shortterm deferred build so much im curious of how you think the contribution of your total services revenue will grow relative to total revenue over time and then also more importantly where do you think the gross margin of the services business could go jayshree ullal  arista networks inc yes ita go ahead ita m brennan  arista networks inc i think the services revenue has been growing as a percentage of total revenue over time at a nice steady growth rate weve seen it go from  to  to  and i think it can continue to do that but its going to be at that steady pace whats your entitlement could it be as much as  from pure services maybe but that will take time the growth the margins on the services side its a little chunky in that the cost structure tends to be fixed and going in blocks but its probably – right now its probably operating and its as high as we would expect to see it operate but you could see some chunkiness in the gross margin if we have to put in a new piece of infrastructure to support something aaron rakers  stifel nicolaus  co inc and you guys dont quantify the product deferred is that correct ita m brennan  arista networks inc we dont split it out jayshree ullal  arista networks inc we split it into longterm and shortterm ita m brennan  arista networks inc longterm and shortterm but we dont break it out between services and products aaron rakers  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of alex kurtz from pacific crest your line is open alex kurtz  pacific crest securities thanks thanks for taking the quick question here just on the  results i was wondering if you could give us a quick refresher on interparty ptab process the review of the  patent and the timing of that and what the strategy could be now that youve learned the fate of the  patents marc taxay  arista networks inc sure so yes there are two iprs that have been instituted on the  and the  patents which were the patents that were found to have been infringed in the  there were hearings that were held at the ptab in march and the final decisions by the ptab will be issued by june  so from a timing standpoint as you probably know theres a day review period – presidential review period following the issuance of the final determination of the itc so that should come out to july  so the ptab decisions will come out several weeks before that at this stage obviously weve been evaluating as i said a moment ago our designaround strategy we are obviously preparing that strategy in the event that we were to lose the iprs and as i said we just received the final determination so we have to go through the actual written opinion to see how that flows through but certainly our plan would be based upon our review of that we have several different options that were evaluating and well have something together before the end of presidential review period alex kurtz  pacific crest securities marc is there an appeals process to the iprs or is it just thats the final decision when that comes out and theres no followon to that process marc taxay  arista networks inc there is an appeal process like everything else there would be an appeal i think to the federal circuit but once those – assuming for a moment that the iprs that were instituted actually that we prevailed the view to the itc as i understand it would be that theyd be considered in effect and the order wouldnt apply to us alex kurtz  pacific crest securities got it thank you charles yager  arista networks inc this concludes the arista q  earnings call i also want to mention that we have posted a presentation that provides additional information on our fiscal results which you can
