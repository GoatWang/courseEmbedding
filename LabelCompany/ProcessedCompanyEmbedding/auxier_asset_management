managementauxier focus fund in an era where the experience of many fund managers is just  years jeff auxier offers his clients a  year record of performance a seasoned perspective on every market bump and bubble a passion for research and an unprecedented devotion to “eating his own cooking” that record includes serving as sr portfolio manager for smith barney where he created a business model that demanded higher levels of accountability to investors he has earned national awards and recognitions for performance and “integrity knowledge and commitment” jeff founded and manages the auxier focus fund jeff began lessons in finance early–at age  mowing the lawn of robert pamplin senior the former longtime ceo of georgia pacific and recipient of the “world’s top ceo award” mr pamplin tutored jeff on living a life of ethics as jeff puts it “mr pamplin always put his shareholders first and believed business should be transparent he said the language of business is accounting and that if you can’t speak the language you can’t make money” in  jeff graduated with honors from the university of oregon with a degree in finance and an emphasis on accounting immediately jeff began calling or personally meeting with some of his investment heroes long before they became today’s financial rock stars names like warren buffett not yet known as the oracle of omaha mr buffett graciously took several of jeff’s calls and offered advice most notably “number one don’t lose your principal and number two never violate the first rule” to this day the cornerstone of the auxier focus fund is respect for the power of compounding jeff began his professional career in  at foster marshallamerican express now smith barney in portland oregon jeff connected with “value investing” but found the retail brokerage business a challenging environment in which to encourage investors to buy businesses wall street despised so in the late ’s jeff helped smith barney create the portfolio management advisory board along with jamie dimon—now ceo of jp morgan chase—jeff and other executives formed policies aimed at better serving client interests “we wanted high levels of disclosure reasonable fees and no broker compensation for trading the portfolio” says jeff jeff also served as a member of the chairman’s council from  to  and senior vice president of investments and senior portfolio management director in  jeff was awarded the consulting group bob dwyer award which honors the portfolio manager whose “integrity knowledge and commitment to the discipline of investment management exemplifies the highest standards” in a national competition pitting some of the nation’s top performers against each other money magazine named jeff their “allstar broker” two years in a row  in  jeff realized his professional dream he left smith barney to start his own investment advisory auxier asset management and in  the auxier focus fund from the start jeff wanted a fund where the manager is held highly accountable so he committed to remaining one of the auxier focus fund’s largest shareholders how many managers invest their entire personal retirement into their own fund in jeff’s case that’s over  shares right on the line with his investors jeff instituted company policy that he will not sell a single share while still manager in addition his family’s assets are included in the money management portion of auxier asset management jeff volunteers gips® compliant numbers showing performance back to  and members of the auxier asset mgt team also have large percentages of their own personal net worth invested in the auxier focus fund the small longtime staff enjoys a “nearly never” meetings policy instead focusing on aggressive fundamental research “everyone here is focused on performance” says jeff “we’ve all got our own money on the line” you don’t survive  years in portfolio management and research analysis without a passionate love for research “we are  research  trading most investors work the opposite” says jeff who happily devours numbers spending  hours each day scrutinizing  companies per week he pours over annual reports trade journals investment publications tracking quarterly conference calls reports and evaluating competitive threats to each franchise stocks are aggressively monitored says jeff “this daily grinditout research helped us sail right around the enron hurricane early on we saw that management claims didn’t square with the numbers we discovered a balance sheet debt that was completely hidden to most investors we sold and made money off enron” jeff doesn’t focus on economic trends—as he puts it the “unknowable”—rather crunching through numbers to unearth outstanding companies that have been knocked down with a temporary problem you can’t predict the future but you can analyze and discover exemplary companies since  jeff has served on the board of directors for colorado based ebags whom he has helped guide to being the  bag retailer in the united states jeff his wife and four children deliberately live far from the wilds of wall street on a  acre farm just outside of portland oregon and just west of the end of the oregon trail nursery stock timber and hazelnuts grow abundantly on the fertile hillsides in a valley where  percent of the nation’s hazelnut crop is harvested in the fall of  jeff harvested a record  tons of hazelnuts from his farm when he’s not researching you may find jeff clearing land on his  thousand pound caterpillar dc bulldozer or scanning his favorite nonfinancial website bulldozercom jeff also conducts research from his acre ranch in the high desert of central oregon where antelope cougar wild boar rattlesnakes and coyotes share the wideopen space jeff sees similarities in investing on wall street and his life on the farm and ranch “all take extremely hard work and involve consideration of price value margin of safety and wise allocation of capital this lifestyle keeps you humble and focused on the rewards of hard work” says jeff “i’m far from the greed and emotion of wall street and able to conduct the kind of independent thinking that keeps us ahead of the pack not chasing it i love my job and consider it a stewardship of other people’s hardearned money i want to do this the rest of my life” chrisi badrick director of portfolio services

shareholder letter forms annual  semiannual reports prospectus  sai for the media contact request materials homeinvestment philosophy  share investment philosophy we believe the power of compounding is the most valuable and underappreciated investment concept our respect for compounding leads us to have a strong aversion to permanent capital loss although there can never be assurance that any portfolio holdings will not decline in value we first look at the downside risk of any investment before looking at the upside potential a dedicated diligent research effort is the key to seeking high compounded portfolio returns our unique advantage comes from the wisdom of managing individual portfolios in every kind of market for over  years we strive to maintain an intense work ethic with the goal of mastering the principals of capital allocation it is imperative for an investor to study history and past market behavior in an effort to avoid repeating costly mistakes the firm’s founder jeff auxier spends  –  hours daily researching annual reports trade journals and investment publications we evaluate domestic and international companies traded on the major exchanges using a valueoriented approach each individual holding is constantly monitored and the operating fundamentals scrutinized we aim to think independently and rationally we are skeptical of conventional wisdom the proper temperament humility and emotional control are critical we dig to find compelling undervalued companies that ideally exhibit the following attributes strong or improving fundamentals consistency in operating results a substantial advantage over competition strong franchise a demonstrated ability to earn high rates of return on capital understandable products honest competent shareholderoriented management intelligent capital allocation policies generates substantial free cash flow with nominal mandatory capital requirements a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility the investment candidates are then screened to determine what price represents good value with acceptable low risk and the potential for above average returns one of the chief investment sins is overpayment we count on exceptional investment selection for our returns not the market during the research process and monitoring of portfolio positions we will look at each company as if we are going to buy the entire enterprise compare the price to private market values and the present value of future cash flows look at each individual security on its own merits and weigh positions based on where the widest gap between price and value exists watch for floods of “easy money” ipos coming into an industry as a warning signal lighten up if the fundamentals deteriorate if “bubble” conditions lead to inflated valuations if a company’s management loses their focus consistently fails to execute or misallocates capital avoid stocks that are highly valued have high expectations and are vulnerable to severe drops on minor disappointments these we call “torpedo stocks” and they destroy the compounding effect on each stock we look to make money from the company’s growth in earnings and intrinsic value together with an upward revaluation by the market we theoretically will hold a company indefinitely if the operating fundamentals continue to improve and the price is reasonable typical situations our goal in managing portfolios is to significantly outperform the sp  index over the longterm while taking far less risk as measured by the beta statistic— volatility measurement relative to the sp  index the ideal investment scenario is one where we have a very high quality high return business with exceptional management selling at washout bargain prices we also look to invest in businesses whose sales and profits are progressing at a sustainable rate and whose price is low due to misperceptions surrounding the true facts and fundamentals we are always weighing the odds to ensure the potential rewards more than compensate for the level of risk a stagnant price is normal and welcome while we are buying as overall market levels become risky and overvalued we then look for the “workouts” that often can provide positive returns but shield us from sharp market declines rising prices lead to a more defensive posture workouts to attempt to add stability and predictability to returns we will typically have a portion of the portfolio in securities that have a timetable these are called “workouts” and are dependent upon a corporate driven event or catalyst as opposed to the supply and demand of the auction markets workouts can arise from reorganizations mergers splitoffs spinoffs sellouts etc while these can be very rewarding in flattodown markets they can penalize returns in a strong up market over the past two years this category has included corporate debt and preferred stock as corporations over borrowed in the boom times balance sheets suffered this led to urgent actions to reduce debt to the benefit of bondholders conditions we thrive in the ideal investment climate to allocate capital and identify significantly undervalued securities is one where the headlines are negative fear and panic abound and emotions are running high extreme volatility usually follows and can lead to exploitable misappraisals as us financier and presidential advisor bernard baruch used to say facts are facts even in the height of emotion often in these periods what is perceived to be risky is far safer than normal like john train author of the money masters has said “the safe time to invest is when investors are discouraged and desperate” conversely the time to be cautious is when everyone is excited news is good and initial public offerings are
