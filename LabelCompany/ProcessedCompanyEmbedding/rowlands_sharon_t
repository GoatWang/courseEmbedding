rowlands its executive of the year in  ms rowlands received her postgraduate certificate in education from the university of london and her bachelor of arts in history from the university of newcastle newcastleupontyne how has your life experience made you the leader you are today my leadership style was shaped by my experience as the oldest of four in a working class family i was head girl in my high school in england and early in my career i transitioned from being a teacher to a financial executive all of these experiences helped shape me into the leader i am today i always find myself excited by the next challenge a small example of that is seen in my passion for golf before one of my mentors mentioned to me that i could actually conduct business on the golf course i had never even picked up a club now i do it as part of my business process but also as pure enjoyment how has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at reachlocal one of my first significant leadership roles was as a sales manager in sales you quickly learn if you have what it takes  or not you hit your quota or you dont as a sales leader youre doubly accountable for those measures because youre responsible for ensuring your entire sales force meets their goals as well in short order you must learn to hire the right people and help them develop their skills to set goals and to appraise people correctly if you dont develop those talents you wont succeed what i learned thirty years ago as a sales manager is still useful to me today in my role as a ceo we are an organization that relies heavily on sales success and making sure our clients are happy so that skill set is still very important to me today what have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at reachlocal we are on a transformation journey that we expect to begin showing positive momentum sometime in the middle of  and leading us back to growth and profitability for years to come when i started in april i knew we had some work to do as a business i think we lost a bit of focus we made some tactical execution errors for example we made a change to the north american sales operation in december  before i started that has had a significant impact on the performance of the company good news is that we know how to course correct and are moving forward with a more effective go to market approach that includes a stronger focus on lead generation were evolving our sales organization to one that balances the need for new business growth and client retention internationally were being smarter about the markets that we invest in and aligning success scaling appropriatelyin those markets as a result all of these challenges have helped us better understand our clients and we are now developing products that provide them greater value  products that they want and need we have a solid talented leadership and employee team who are passionate about our business and helping our clients succeed we are working on the right things now and we have a product roadmap in place that will get us back to growth and profitability i remain optimistic and excited about the future of reachlocal what advice can you offer to women who want to start their own business i recently wrote an article for huffington post that included tips to becoming a ceo i think those tips are also relevant to women who want to start their own business those tips are  manage a sales force at least once in your career  learn your way around a balance sheet and a computer  build your network in addition to that id advise building a sound business plan so that you are smartly measuring your risks associated with that business putting all that aside i say go for it we can always come up with a reason for why we shouldnt do something what is the most important lesson youve learned in your career to date i had always thought that if i focused on my job and drove results then the next opportunity would come when my previous employer merged with another company i did not get the top job i realized that i had not spent enough time networking managing up to the board and building my own pr making sure you have champions who can help push on your behalf and also bring opportunities to your attention is also key i tell my executives that i dont want them to do much of this but the reality is you have to do some of it how do you maintain a worklife balance im not sure that theres such a thing as worklife balance and everyone defines that differently i think its just life what do i mean by that there are going to be times when im so focused on work that i have to push everything else aside but then there are times when i may not look at email all day if ive made a commitment to one of my children there are times when i might be on my way to the dentist and im taking a conference call hands free of course on my way to that appointment each individual has to adjust their life in the way that is best suited for them what do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace i think men and women run into similar challenges in the workplace i do still think that women have to work harder to move ahead in certain areas of business thats why i think its critical for women to ensure they have the right financial acumen if they have ambition to follow a career path outside of support functions in a business i would advise those women to take that more seriously at the beginning of their career how has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life i attribute part of my success to the fact that i had great opportunities and great champions along the way but i also worked to develop skills that i saw were necessary for the leadership roles that i wanted which eventually led me to my role today i also want to call out that i had champions i think mentors can be helpful but champions or advocates can have even greater impact these are going to be the people who open up paths for you make you aware of opportunities that you otherwise may not have visibility to and who introduce you to other influencers that can help you in your career which other female leaders do you admire and why its great to see more women leaders across all sorts of organizations  political business and nonprofit personally i am impressed when i see women who have achieved so much despite having to overcome many personal challenges typically these women all have something in common  courage i have gotten to know so many courageous women over the last few years that have become great friends and colleagues women who have suffered pain in their lives from losing loved ones or going through intense emotional challenges such as divorce and illness yet they still manage to succeed in their careers and serve as inspirations to many people if i have to name one person in terms of public figures hillary clinton always stands out for me i love the way she holds her head high and powers ahead despite all she endured in terms of her personal life playing out in the public arena its a great lesson for us all in keeping your focus and not allowing the challenges that inevitably come up get in the way of your ultimate goals what do you want reachlocal to accomplish in the next year i want us to remain focused on executing our strategy of providing the leading total digital marketing system to local businesses we know that our clients need great products and a great client experience i want us to be more vocal about the unique value that we provide our clients  software with expert service so we help you do it we can help business owners easily and simply get a total view of all of their digital marketing from lead sources to conversion rates to revenue from new customers all so they finally know their return on investment and can make better decisions about their marketing budget  something that our competitors
