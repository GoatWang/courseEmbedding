call over to pierre pierre nanterme thank you angie and thanks everyone for joining us today this was not a strong quarter for accenture we delivered revenue growth in the upper end of our guided range and again gained significant market share i am particularly pleased with our very strong new bookings for the quarter and yeartodate which demonstrates that our services and capabilities continue to be both highly relevant to our clients and very differentiated in the marketplace we generated very strong cash flow for the quarter and returned substantial cash to shareholders all the while continuing to make significant investments to drive future growth here are a few highlights for the quarter we delivered excellent new bookings of  billion we grew revenues of  in local currency to  billion with broad based growth once again across the different dimensions of our business we delivered earnings per share of  on an adjusted basis an  increase operating margin was  on an adjusted basis consistent with the third quarter last year we generated strong free cash flow  billion and we returned approximately  billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend so we had another good quarter and as we enter the fourth quarter i feel very confident that we are well positioned to deliver our business outlook for the year now let me hand over to david who will review the numbers in greater detail david over to you david p rowland thanks pierre and thanks to all of you for joining us on todays call as pierre mentioned we were pleased with our third quarter results which were in the range we expected and position us very well to achieve our full year financial guidance before i get into the details of the quarter i thought it would be useful to highlight how were delivering on an essential aspect of our growth strategy and our model for driving superior shareholder value you have heard me saying many times previously that our growth strategy was conceived with an important objective in mind which is to create durability in our revenue growth at a level which is consistently above market thereby taking share and strengthening our position as a market leader and against that objective weve created a diverse business that spans  industry groups  geographic markets  businesses which has created a powerful growth model in both scale and durability our third quarter and yeartodate results are good illustration of our growth model in action where being a market leader across many dimensions of the market has resulted in consistent growth levels that we estimate are more than two times the rate of growth of the basket of publicly traded companies and importantly we delivered these results in a highly dynamic environment which is exactly the way our growth strategy is intended to work with that said we will also comment on a few of the highlights and the context of our three financial imperatives for driving shareholder value net revenue growth of  in local currency in the third quarter continued to be highlighted by strong doubledigit growth in all three areas of the new including digital cloud and security related services we continued to see positive growth in most geographic markets and industries and while we saw encouraging signs in several areas of pressure previously noted we did experience lower than expected revenues in health and public service in north america at the same time we continue to be very pleased with momentum in europe in the growth markets which combined delivered  growth in the quarter operating margin on an adjusted basis of  in the third quarter was consistent with last year and resulted in  basis points of expansion on a yeartodate basis this level of margin expansion continues to include significant investments in our business and our people and on a yeartodate basis we have delivered very strong earnings per share growth of  over fy adjusted eps and free cash flow of  billion in the quarter and  billion yeartodate keeps us on a trajectory to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year while returning at least  billion cash to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and we continued to invest significantly to acquire skill and capability in key growth areas with a yeartodate capital investment of  billion across seven ph transactions so were pleased with our overall results in the third quarter which continued to demonstrate the durability of our growth profitability and cash flow with that said lets get into the details of the quarter starting with new bookings new bookings were  billion for the quarter consulting bookings were  billion with a booktobill of  outsourcing bookings were  billion also with a booktobill of  we were very pleased with our new bookings which represent  growth in local currency reflecting the second highest level of new bookings in our history with a record high in consulting bookings turning now to revenues net revenues for the quarter were  billion a  increase in usd and  in local currency reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of approximately  compared with a  impact provided in our business outlook last quarter our consulting revenues for the quarter were  billion up  in usd and  in local currency outsourcing revenues were  billion up  in usd and  in local currency looking at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions growth was led by operations which posted doubledigit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter and application services which delivered highsingledigit growth both operations and application services growth was fueled by significant rotation to the new strategy and consulting services combined continued to grow lowsingle digits across those businesses the dominant driver continues to be strong doubledigit growth in the new with all three components digital cloud and security growing doubledigits as well taking a closer look at our operating groups product flow at all operating groups was  growth driven by strong growth across all industries and geographies led by consumer goods retail and travel services financial services grew  in the quarter driven by strong growth in banking and capital markets globally and overall strong growth in both europe and the growth markets resources grew  and returned to positive growth this quarter as expected reflecting growth across all geographies globally we saw very strong growth in chemicals and natural resources and good growth in utilities while the challenges in energy continued communications media and technology also grew  reflecting strong doubledigit growth in software and platforms which more than offset roughly flat growth in the other two industries we saw solid overall growth in north america and very strong growth in the growth markets partially offset by continued contraction in europe finally hps came in lower than expected at  growth as we did not see the uptick that we anticipated in both public service and health in north america our north america business was negatively impacted by a slower than expected decision making and initiation of new projects due to continued uncertainty on healthcare legislation and state and federal budgets we now expect these factors to continue to impact our business at least through the fourth quarter moving down the income statement gross margin for the quarter was  compared to  the same period last year sales and marketing expense for the quarter was  consistent with the third quarter last year general and administrative expense was  compared to  for the same period last year this quarter we recorded a settlement charge related to the terminations of our us pension plan consistent with my comments in march this  million charge decreased quarter three operating margin by  basis points lowered our quarter three tax rate by  and decreased net income by  million and diluted earnings per share by  the following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results operating income was  billion in the third quarter reflecting a  adjusted operating margin consistent with quarter three last year our effective tax rate for the quarter was  compared with an effective tax rate of  for the same period last year diluted earnings per share were  compared with eps of a  in the third quarter last year our days services outstanding were one days compared to  days last quarter and  days in the third quarter last year free cash flow for the quarter was  billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of  billion net of property and equipment additions of  million our cash balance at may st was  billion compared with  billion at august st with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders in the third quarter we repurchased to redeem  million shares for  million at an average price of  per share at may st we had  billion of share repurchase authority remaining finally as pierre mentioned on may   we made our second semiannual dividend payment for fiscal  in the amount of a  per share bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately  billion so with three quarters in the books we feel good about our results today and were working hard to deliver quarter four and another successful year now let me turn it back to pierre pierre nanterme thank you david our strong results for the quarter and yeartodate demonstrate that we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy we are successfully driving the business transformation at accenture while at the same time consistently delivering above market performance today the breadth of capabilities we provide end to end is truly unique in the marketplace and we are well positioned to compete at scale in each of our five businesses driving synergies across them to deliver value and business outcomes for our clients we continue to rotate our business to the new digital cloud and security related services which again grew at a very strong doubledigit rate in the quarter and now accounts for  of total revenue i am absolutely delighted that we have achieved this significant milestone for our business so rapidly our ascension to these new high growth areas the differentiation of our capabilities in the market and the diversity of our business have enabled us to continue to gain significant market share the need to go digital remains a top priority for clients and we are investing aggressively to drive innovation and deliver digital transformation a great example is the capability we have indiscernible accenture interactive and i am again delighted that for the second year in a row advertising age has named accenture interactive the largest provider of digital marketing services both globally and in the us accenture interactive is working with many of the worlds leading brands to transform the customer experience as an illustration with carnival the cruise operator we are helping develop a new platform using wearable technology the internet of things and analytics to transform the guest experience with intelligent customerization carnival will be able to anticipate every passengers preferences likes and needs and we continue to broaden the services we provide through accenture interactive in the third quarter we acquired two creative and design agencies in australia the monkeys and maud and we acquired kunstmann in belgium to expand our digital and user experience capabilities in todays digital and highly connected world security is essential and were building a market leading security capability to help clients become more resilient i am pleased that in the third quarter we saw very strong doubledigit growth in our security business and we are bringing deep and differentiated expertise to our clients we are working with a california based facility to protect its critical assets including nuclear power plants through expertise inside their security as well as identity and access management increasingly the work we do is enabled more and more by new it including automation robotics and intelligent platforms we are helping a global healthcare company embrace digital across its entire enterprise ultimately using accenture mywizard our intelligence automation platform to improve application quality and productivity we are working with the us transportation security administration to modernize the enterprise applications using agile and devops software development and during the quarter we expanded our capabilities in intelligent automation with the acquisition of genfour in the uk and earlier this month we acquired solutionsiq a leading provider of agile services adding some of the most experienced agile coaches in the industry to our team we continued to hold a unique position in the technology echo system as the leading partner of both the established providers and emerging players just last week microsoft named accenture its si partner of the year for the tenth year in a row in may we received three sap pinnacle awards more than any other company for our work helping clients design deploy and manage sap enterprise systems and we have expanded our collaboration with sap to coinnovate codevelop and jointly gotomarket with new solutions that combine our industry expertise and analytics capabilities with sap leonardo the new system that integrates digital technologies including match and learning analytics and internet of things turning out to the geographic dimensions of our business and our results for the quarter in north america we delivered revenue growth of  in local currency driven by united states as david mentioned this was below our expectations given the increased uncertainty in the marketplace in health and public service related to healthcare legislation and state and federal projects in europe i am very pleased that we had another strong performance growing revenue  in local currency driven primarily by doubledigit growth in the united kingdom germany and france and in gross markets we delivered another excellent quarter with  growth in local currency led by very strong doubledigit growth in japan ph as well as doubledigit growth in australia as well as in singapore before i hand it back to david i want to take a moment to acknowledge some of the external recognition we have received for our brand and differentiated strategy and again we never take this for granted i am delighted that for the th year in a row we were recognized on brandzs list of the top  most valuable global brand as well for the sixth consecutive year we were included in forbes ranking of the top global brands we improved our rankings and drove significant increases in brand value on both lists and for the second year in a row we were among the top  companies on the barrons  and we were also included on barrons list of most respected companies i strongly really believe that over the years we have built a durable business model for accenture based on two major building blocks first our accelerated rotation to the new which enhances our relevance to clients and second our highly diverse portfolio of business which enables us to drive durable performance of a cycle of uncertainty and volatility and that is why looking ahead i remain very confident in our business strategy and our market position with that i will turn the call over to david to provide our updated business outlook david david p rowland thank you pierre let me now turn to our business outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect revenues to be in the range of  billion to  billion this assumes the impact of fx will be negative  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  and reflects an estimated  to  growth in local currency for the full fiscal year  based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks we now assume the impact of fx on our results in us dollars will be negative  compared to fiscal  for the full fiscal  we now expect our net revenues to be in the range of  to  growth in local currency over fiscal  for operating margin on an adjusted basis we now expect fiscal year  to be  a  basis point expansion over fiscal  results we now expect our annual effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to be in the range of  to  our earnings per share on an adjusted basis we now expect full year diluted eps for fiscal  to be in the range of  to  or  to  growth over adjusted fiscal  results for the full fiscal  we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of  billion to  billion property and equipment additions to be in the range of  million and free cash flow to be in the range of  billion to  billion we continue to expect to return at least  billion through dividends and share repurchases and also continue to expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by slightly more than  as we remain committed to returning substantial portion of the cash to shareholders and finally for the full year we now expect to invest in the range of  billion in acquisitions with that lets open it up so we can take your questions angie angie park thanks david i would ask that you each stick to one question and a followup to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question ryan would you provide instructions for those on the call questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of tientsin huang with jpmorgan please go ahead tientsin huang hey good morning thanks just let me start by asking about bookings bookings were good and in line with where we were at you said it would improve in the second half it did in the third quarter do you expect that momentum to carry into the fourth quarter have you replenished the pipeline etc going into q david p rowland yeah we still hate tension by the way we feel good about our bookings position in the fourth quarter and we expect to have another very good quarter of bookings so we think that momentum does continue tientsin huang okay and then on just the new revenue here versus the i guess you want to call it legacy or the not new any surprise in the trend there just thinking about the math and if theres been any change in momentum in either david p rowland well i would say on that front its really been more of the same our growth in the new continues to go at very very high levels well above  growth in the quarter which is what weve seen pretty consistently this year the market demand is tremendous and it plays extremely well to the investments that weve made over the last several years now and building capabilities to be the leader in that part of the marketplace so were extremely pleased it is broad based literally across our operating groups our  geographic units and if you look at the three components of digital cloud and security again very strong doubledigit growth really across the board so we couldnt be more pleased with what we see in that part of our business tientsin huang thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line edward caso with wells fargo please go ahead edward caso hi good morning i was curious about your efforts on the acquisition front obviously youre providing all your cash flow back to investors and therefore using the cash on your balance sheet to fund your fairly aggressive acquisition program at what point do you hit a level where you desire to have your cash david p rowland well i think  and weve talked about this before and we are fortunate in that with the strength of our overall financials including our balance sheet we have a lot of levers at our disposal as we manage our business really for many years to come when we look out our need to acquire critical skills and capabilities in important growth areas in the market we dont see that changing certainly over the next three years and so we think thats going to continue to be an important part of our investment strategy we think it will be an important part of an engine for growth overall and ultimately for us as you know this is all about quickly assimilating these capabilities and driving organic growth over time so we really see more of the same with our acquisition strategy going forward and we think we have the financial flexibility to accommodate that while also returning cash to shareholders pierre nanterme yeah not much to add i think we have an extremely clear strategy at accenture which is all about rotating to the new and in order to enable this strategy we have set very clear financial context we shared with all of you on how we are going to locate our cash and our free cash flow with this rate at the same time investing more than ever to the transformation of accenture to give the relevant services of the future and create durable performance over the next cycle of change and at the same time continuing with very i guess very good return to shareholder approach both in term of share buyback and in terms of dividends so we believe that this strategy is playing very well and as david mentioned we still have opportunities to invest even more should that be required leveraging more our balance sheets one way or the other so i feel extremely good with where we are from an investment standpoint from a financial standpoint and from our strategic allocation of cash edward caso my other related question is around the assimilation of these employees these are generally smaller more entrepreneurial firms that generally have a different character of employee than a traditional accenture trained and developed person can you give us any sense for the attrition at these acquired companies that are relative to the base and how youre managing that thank you pierre nanterme thanks for the question because it was  when we decided our new strategy of rotating to the new that was clearly a big question we had in front of us we benefit from accenture from a very strong culture you know very well based on what weve been doing for multiple decades and when you are rotating to the new and the new is still different in terms of you mentioned digital we are talking about the millennium but again in terms of disciplines such as designled thinking such as experience driven projects such as prototyping such as being more agile devops no doubt you need to attract people who are going to be different from where you are and simply said we make what i think is a very profound and important evolution in our industry which is creating this concept of accenture we have a culture of cultures so we celebrate the diversity of the cultures so we are extremely respectful of the cultural field which is our design digital marketing organization with now thousand people we have the largest digital design studio in the world we are extremely respectful of the people we are hiring from security as you know that well and i would not elaborate these people are different in the security specs and theyre walking like a tribe around their own discipline and we are extremely respectful to keep that culture thats why we created endtoend accenture security under the leadership of kelly bissell an incredibly strong security leader on the side by omar abbosh our chief strategy officer so we developed this culture this concept of culture of cultures very different from this old and i think outdated concept of one culture on the other end we are extremely stringent on our values and we are making a big difference around cultures they have to be different which is what is bringing richness in our company and innovation but the values shouldn’t be compromised and are not for negotiation and the values at accenture we will never negotiate with respect for individual inclusion and diversity ethics compliance client first stewardship and all of this has nothing to do with culture its just the appropriate business and personnel behavior you and i and everybody on the planet should develop and i think we have been very good in creating and developing this culture of cultures concept and right david all the integration we made all but i am not saying thats likely been successful david p rowland yeah are we carefully manage the retention of the people in these companies that we acquire and our performance have really over the last three years in terms of retaining talent has been very good edward caso thank you david p rowland thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of bryan bergin with cowen please go ahead david p rowland good morning bryan bryan bergin thank you as the number comes from majority share of your business how should we think about potential changes and corporate revenue trajectory or particularly margin expansion do you foresee any inflection in item over the mediumterm pierre nanterme you know again i will stop short of saying anything that would imply guidance for next year or beyond but i would say that broadly speaking if you look at two of our three overriding financial objectives the first one being to drop durable growth which is consistently above the market as i said taking share and extending our position as a market leader and in the second overriding objective which is consistent modest margin expansion while investing in increasing scale in our business and driving eps growth faster than revenue growth we remain committed to those as kind of multiyear objectives that we work very hard to achieve and i think the rotation to the new creates more opportunity for achieving those as opposed to a threat so that is  i think it gives us better positioning and a better opportunity to continue to deliver on those overtime bryan bergin okay and just a follow up then just as far as expanding into some of our markets interactive business i thought was a great example of getting you access into an area within the same office are there other areas that youre potentially looking at within client wallets that are logical extensions that you might be targeting pierre nanterme security is another one with the business resulting with accenture security clearly we are expanding our access to new leaders given the depth and breadth of all services you are absolutely right it is our ambition to increase the coverage of the leaders we might serve with clients from the ceo the cfo the coo the cio now the chief digital officer with the launch of accenture digital you know there are new leaders under this terminology and we want to be the top choice for the newly appointed cdos which should be a quite a natural act you mentioned the cmos with what we are doing with accenture interactive and we have all the business in the different parts of the business so if i am looking at accenture we have now settled with the five businesses we have in this businesses you have all the activities such as analytics interactive mobility cloud security i could mention accenture credit services we are in the us which is providing access in banks to credit part of the organization and i mentioned a lot so i guess and i would claim that we are settling the organization in professional services which today broader access to any client leadership group bryan bergin thank you pierre nanterme thank you operator our next question comes from the line of lisa ellis with bernstein please go ahead lisa ellis hi good morning guys i am good so question just around the mix of business so i noticed gdn mix down ticked slightly this quarter thats quite unusual i think thats the first time in years thats happened and at the same time you had a really strong headcount growth quarter at over  but then david in your comments you called out that youre seeing very strong growth in the new in areas like application and services which suggests more like build related activities which i would associate with offshore so kind of two part question coming out of that one are you with the strong headcount growth and gdn mix that are stabilizing are we going to see an acceleration in revenue per head that might cause some break in the linearly in the business and then also just secondarily can you just talk a little bit about the mix of the type of work youre seeing in the new as it gets to be over  of the business and if thats sort of fundamentally different in terms of mix of service lines relative to the core pierre nanterme yeah maybe i get a start with our strategic direction on this we are working extremely hard as you know at accenture on robotic automation and bringing intelligent capabilities to significantly improve our productivity especially where we have largescale operations so with technology and in operations so we are working hard on what you said how we are moving forward were going to have less direct correlation between revenue and headcount and clearly the big game on this is to accelerate our investments in robotic automation and intelligent services which is exactly indiscernible for accenture technology and debbie polyshoot ph for accenture operation are working extremely hard and we are starting to see some very encouraging results where we could drive more revenues with a bit less people in some part of accenture operations and in some part of our bpo we are starting to feel the support of inflection certainly we need another year or  months to see whether this trend might accelerate and change the dynamic between revenue and headcount growth which is something of course we are pursuing systematically on the second question what is the complexion of our work in term with the new i mean the good news is we were taking everything to the new strategy consulting digital of course technology and operations and all our services in the new are going very well strategy and consulting growth in the new is doubledigit but as well it is driving significant growth in accenture technology and in our platforms if i am looking at the business with driving analytics through sap hana and tomorrow with sap leonardo is driving significant growth in the new sap in the new microsoft in the new oracle and i can mention  and i could mention others but as well it is creating activities in operations i am thinking about what were doing in customer analytics leading to accenture analytics or to accenture interactive it is driving business with platform as a service in terms of analytics what we are calling accenture analytics insight platform this is a service which is directly linked to the new services we are providing from an analytical standpoint so its really the new is driving growth in each of our five business in a very meaningful way and we love that david p rowland yeah and lisa i would say that you may remember that it was the third quarter of last year and then again in the fourth quarter where i had made comments that we were starting to see an improving trend and the progression of revenue per billable head and so you asked will we start to see that i think we have seen instances of that if you look over the last three or four quarters the other thing just to remind you and others who are looking at the headcount numbers gdn includes our locations around the world including gdn headcount and lets say the more mature markets and so gdn is in the united states as an example its not just india and the philippines lisa ellis terrific thanks and just one quick follow up pierre i think on your comment there on the new so would you characterize at this point if you just compared this year versus maybe like this time last year or two years ago that the mix of work in the new now is much more diverse across your service lines youre fully into what id call more like build and run activities pierre nanterme absolutely right and i think we see and im pleased with that we see this new maturing so as all services you have a kind of maturity curve where you are starting with more pioneering strategy consulting rich programs kind of prototyping in the early phase of the maturity curve what we see is now all these new capabilities im thinking about interactivity mobility identity cloud security soon come into traffic artificial intelligent block chain and immersive reality and certainly in the near future quantum computing all of this new capabilities are getting more mature are driving on balance bigger programs and as we are moving from small prototyping to bigger programs suddenly it is expanding in several service lines from strategy to consulting but as well to technology and to operations so we  this business is maturing very well at accenture with a positive effect in all our five businesses if you will and indeed we see more bigger deals which is a sign of the market maturing david p rowland thank you lisa operator our next question comes on of bryan keane with deutsche bank please go ahead bryan keane hi guys wanted to ask about the accenture business dimensions the growth rates there have surprised me i guess on one hand app services which grew mid singledigits in fiscal year  has gone up to high singledigits and i know theres a lot of worries in the marketplace about a secular decline in that business so thats been a surprise on the positive end and then on the other strategy and consulting which grew doubledigits in fiscal year  is kind of hovering below kind of my expectations at low singledigits so just trying to understand the strength in app services versus the weakness in strategy and consulting david p rowland yeah i think when you  i will make a few comments and pierre may have some as well but first of all when you look at app services its important to focus on the point that our growth is coming from the higher value application engineering systems integration type work that is driven by the adoption of new it in this rotations of the new and so to some extent it kind of ties back to lisas question and pierres answer is that what youre starting to see is the adoption rate of new it and digital broadly is increasing youre starting in our business to see more systems integration application work associated with the implementation of digital technologies new ip etc and i think that is really whats driving our application services weve said before pierre has said many times that our strategy in app services is to rapidly grow and expand in the si space the application outsourcing is a different marketplace it is largely commoditized and we will continue to have an application maintenance footprint but our application services business is really all about the systems integration application engineering enabling the adoption of new it and digital technologies for our clients and thats reflected in the pickup in growth rates maybe just one more comment on the strategy and consulting combined again that can ebb and flow pierre also eluded earlier and its worth noting again is that you really have to decompose the strategy consulting number to really understand whats going on and if you look at our strategy and consulting business that is related to projects in the new that part of strategy and consulting is growing mid teens so lets say in the  kind range so its a very very strong growth for those services related to enabling the new with our clients the area that is not as robust right now lets say is the more traditional strategy and consulting that is not specifically tied to this rotation to the new bryan keane okay thats helpful and then just as a follow up on contributions of acquisitions how much did acquisitions contribute to the quarterly revenue growth and i know we talked about  points for the back half of the year i dont know since you took up the amount that you were going to spend on acquisitions i think it went up to a little bit to  billion from  billion if that changed anything for the outlook thanks so much david p rowland you know that does have materially changed the number because obviously were acquiring these  lets say that increases more in the back of the last three months of the year so that has more of an impact on  than it does this year having said that we still think were going to be at roughly in the ballpark of  for the full year previously i have said the back half of the year would be  it will be just incrementally kind of above that but not materially above that so clearly it is consistent with what i have said before a slightly higher in the back half of the year than the  bryan keane okay thanks so much im just curious on the third quarter itself was it up to  points so far or not quite yet david p rowland yeah in that zone bryan keane okay thanks so much david p rowland thank you operator next question comes on of jim schneider with goldman sachs please go ahead david p rowland good morning jim jim schneider hello good morning thank you for taking my question i was wondering if you could maybe comment on the north america piece of the business what are you hearing from clients just broadly speaking can you maybe just kind of give us a sense about whether the north america slowdown was purely isolated to the health and public service area or what you are hearing from clients generally and what you expect that to be kind of like a one off one quarter thing or something that could continue for a couple of quarters david p rowland first of all as it relates to our expectations and then pierre may add some comments as well but let me just deal with the results relative to our expectations so we had seen slower growth in hps in quarter one and quarter two you will remember quarter two was a  which is where we ended up and not in quarter three we had expected not based on hope but based on what we felt was kind of tangible evidence in the second quarter that we were going to see an uptick in growth in the third quarter in the second half of the year and thats what i called out  days ago what we saw was that that uptick if you will or that freeing up of the initiation of new projects and lets say a return to more normal decision making patterns on contracting new work that just simply did not improve as we had expected and so if you look at north america and the difference between where we landed and where we expected to land the difference is the vast majority of that is in health and public service for the reasons i mentioned in the script its the difference between north america growth being at  and  order of magnitude and it was the difference  it was probably a point of growth it was a point of growth at the expense level in total so it was meaningful having said that we have a very strong health and public service practice and at some point the logjam will break and work will be initiated and we will be right there and again when that happens and of course broadly in north america we feel that way as well pierre nanterme yes absolutely right and i understand you are asking this question on north america for me on the positive side we continue to grow more than the market and gaining significant market share in north america despite the fact that the level of growth is lower at the level of growth of the market as we are analyzing it as well as slowing down secondly our rotation to the new in north america is excellent and were going to get close to  as with the rest of accenture so we have zero issues in terms of executing our strategy and three we continue to invest so we are not changing our investment profile and we believe its the right time to invest to be prepared for the future and to be prepared when the market will be good again now what is the situation and indeed a big difference from what we expected three months ago these annual you should probably know when you are in the us and french you are probably have a certainly better informed point of view on this but there is an expectation that indeed the new administration will launch critical reforms in order to boost the business and economy growth and this economic reform probably i would say the one which are the most important the healthcare reform the tax reform the trade reform and anything linked to the infrastructure investments and all of these four were the ones supposed to indeed unleash more growth for the business so the business could invest and drive more growth and by driving more growth and driving more investment we would have a positive impact fact of the matter of is that we dont do this to be honest three months ago because just rating the observers and all the analytics we believe that these four reforms would happen reasonably rapidly in the us and fact of the matter they are not yet being announced or executed and so we are in this zone where the business is still waiting its still positive but waiting for these reforms to happen to invest and so which has a negative effect especially on hps which has been the vertical more impacted by this kind of wait and see mode on what could happen with the reform and we are ready to in fact in these couple of quarters the overall profit for services market in the us been slowing down and so to some extent we are moderating with the market while continuing to do much better than the market and so i am positive that when the market will be back because that will happen we are in better position than anyone else given the investment and the positioning we are taking so im looking that with my french glasses and i would encourage the us to accelerate their reforms david p rowland and as i said its a perfect illustration though of the power of the diversity of our model where europe and the growth markets combined in the third quarter and grew doubledigits  and so that is intentionally the way our business is constructed for this exact reason and so it is working as designed pierre nanterme and its interesting to see sorry to elaborate but i think its important for all the people listening to the call because you might wonder is why things are doing so well in europe we have  growth and you know it is  but i think in europe you have less uncertainties now i think we had good prospect that probably germany might reelect angela merkel so its a poll of stability i guess the election of emmanuel macron in france has been recognized and celebrated by the market because he is proeuropean which has created a very positive impact around whether europe will disappear or not i think germany and france are being extraordinary for business is recreating a very solid coalition and the brexit thing is moving at its pace but the place we know it is going to happen so its not an uncertainty the uncertainty is what exactly is it going to be hard soft gentle probably the european will figure out as a  or we can figure it out over centuries but its interesting if you take china china i guess not much uncertainty the credibility is very clear on what it wants to achieve its driving these five years of reform program so you see what i mean its interesting that there is one place it is a big place in the world where you have this kind of wait for the reforms to happen it is currently in the united states but i am personally feeling very good that these reforms will happen and the business will pick up again jim schneider that thats helpful thank you for the color and just as a quick follow up going back to the ma question for a second if you look at the run rate of ma that you are doing in q this year would you expect that to accelerate incrementally from here getting into fiscal  and then i think pierre you made an allusion to using the balance sheet for ma does that imply youre willing to put some debt on the balance sheet to finance more ma at this point david p rowland i think as it relates to your last question we said consistently for as long as i can remember that we always i mean were well aware of that being an option and given the right circumstances we would have no concern about doing that and we would as we always do we would make very smart decisions as to when and at what level we do that but that is certainly an option that is open to us and we have no concerns at all about using that option given the right circumstances pierre nanterme i mean so far we said i mean david and i we are extremely disciplined and our financial model is extremely clear and has been communicated to all of you we expect  to  of our annual growth to be driven by acquisitions our growth is  to  organic lets be clear and frequent from that and  to  of annual growth my counter acquisitions depending on the opportunities these things are lumpy so about that we expect that anything between  to  every year of free cash flow will be dedicated to acquisition and the right as we do would be a return to our shareholders in a program which i think is extremely attractive to all of you with the mix share buyback and dividend so this is our ongoing thesis from a financial algorithm if you will now we have opportunities by leveraging more to balance it to if we have any relevant opportunities that would bring differentiation that would be more transformation more leadership in the new in some spaces it could be artificial intelligence factoring immersive realities quantum computing would say what to make some significant steps but so far we are with our ongoing thesis i just mentioned before and we are very pleased with where we are and im very pleased that we have what we need if we have for good reasons to move faster or make different transactions jim schneider thank you david p rowland great thank you operator our next question will come from the line of david koning with baird please go ahead david koning yeah hey guys thank you i guess first of all just when we think of the new i think you said about  of revs now when we looked back a year ago was about  of revs so its growing like  to  something like that whereas the rest the business is declining high singledigits it looks like is that just existing clients are just shifting their preferences rather than really some of that old stuff just going away its just a shift and then i guess second to that overall growth has decelerated a little bit is that because of the yield on some of the new projects are a little less than some of the legacy david p rowland you know first of all when you look at overall growth when we provide a guidance of  to  at the beginning of the year and of course were going to land very solidly within that range we have said that growing doubledigits each and every year is just an unrealistic expectation we worked hard to drive as much growth as we can but each and every year were not going to drop doubledigit growth and we think that we look at our growth rate against what the market is growing and in a market that lets say generally has grown lets say anywhere in the  to  range lets say if you looked over the last two to three years if were growing  as we are this year were growing two times the rate of the market growth and so are we lower than where we were doubledigit growth the last two years we are but were growing two times the rate of overall market growth which is clearly the indicator of a leader in the sector and so thats what were all about and growth in the  to  range where weve got to  to  growth is actually quite strong growth in the market pierre nanterme yeah i mean we are just reflecting on when im looking at the performance of the company and we are in the right place or not i mean summarizing what we are really doing at accenture we said our revenue would be in the range of  to  right david i mean so far we are at  right in the zone then the question might be is  good or not the only way to understand whether  is good or not is to compare with the rest of the market and we believe that at  were growing twice the market and growing twice the market for a company of our size is an incredible positive results second part of our philosophy as well at the same time our revenues are growing  our eps is growing  were growing the eps more than our revenues and again i think its a sign of good financial performance i remember that it said we want to grow eps at the same rate as our revenues we are growing eps even slightly higher than the revenue which is of course an exceptional performance from david and then for me david is taking care of the numbers and i am taking care of the strategy thats why we have  we are a good duo for me if there is a highlight for this quarter and i hope thats the one youre going to take is this  there are all sorts of metrics all sort of numbers there which i think are all landing in the right place we are probably beating our guidance we said three months ago on each and every dimension and providing extraordinary good financial but then whats important i think for all of you and for me are we executing this strategy which is going to create a new accenture which could be competitive for the future and again it is a yes thats why i wanted to put even in the announcement for the first time outside in what according to figures we had that we hit the milestone of  and i would like all of us analyst investors because youre putting a lot of confidence on accenture to celebrate this milestone because its a very big and important milestone for us at accenture we will properly celebrate in boston with a very nice glass of cocacola among other things by the way because we are still humble so no champagne yet but it is very important jokes apart i mean imagine what it is in  years we are rotating  of the business of the company of  billion to the new thats what has been achieved and were not going to stop there we will continue accelerating because we won by  towards the vast majority of our revenues being in the new this might turn  was for me at least was for me the highlight of the quarter and i hope it is as well something you will consider extremely important in the successful execution of our strategy together with the rights to very strong financial performance pierre nanterme so that being said thanks again for joining us on todays call i mean needless to say and with a few words i just said before the conclusion that i and the leadership team of accenture we feel good about where we are we feel good about where we are because we continue to build on our strong position in the marketplace i mean what we have said we are rotating our business to the new which is now  of our revenues and again i would like to pound that because for me its exceptional we are gaining significant market share growing in average twice as fast as the market and i think this is very noticeable in each and every market if you look at this north america europe and the gross market the minimum is twice the market in some markets were growing much more than twice sometimes four times the market and we continue to gain market share and we continue and this is where im delighted with what were doing we continue to invest in new capabilities to drive future growth and to create the future of that company while delivering value for all of you but as well for all our stakeholders including  people who are working every day very hard to transform the company and make accenture the partner of choice for many of our clients we look forward to talking with you again next quarter in the meantime if you have any questions

the hbr ideacast from harvard business review i’m sarah green carmichael today i’m talking with pierre nanterme the chairman and ceo of accenture pierre thank you so much for talking with us today pierre nanterme my pleasure sarah green carmichael so i thought i would start with the very big picture i am constantly hearing people say that business is more volatile more uncertain things are moving faster and faster this has become one of the things that people just say and accept as if it’s true what is your take on that is that in fact the way business is today or is there something else going on pierre nanterme i mean certainly yes the world has always been uncertain this is the nature of the world but probably the pace has changed and the radical eq of the transformation are more important than in the past which is requiring a lot of agility in the way you run the business now sarah green carmichael now i have heard you say before that there is three phases to digital transformation what are those three phases pierre nanterme the three would be number one the digital consumer this is a way we’ve seen how you interact and you engage with the consumer using digital technology and creating what i would call hyperpersonalization the second wave is digital enterprise it’s how you digitalize your business process operating processes inside the company it could be hr it could be finance it could be the way you interact with your employees it could be governance it could be the ceo being fully digitalized using hologram which is the ultimate illustration of how you can digitalize governance and the third wave is kicking now it’s what we’re calling digital operation you could call that industrial internet you could call that the internet of things it’s where the internet is going to be pervasive across all products we’re going to use and create a brand new environment sarah green carmichael so i’m glad you mentioned the hologram you’re the only ceo i’ve ever talked to or even heard of who has ever appeared as a hologram what was that story pierre nanterme i mean sarah you’re very lucky because i’m here physically maybe next time you will interview my hologram indeed we are a very large organization we have  people operating in  countries and you can’t be everywhere and it’s extremely important that you’re remaining in touch with your people and we are using a lot of digital technologies at accenture we have our internal social network if you will all our conference and when i address our  people it’s through digital webcast telepresence ogio last time we had to record  people live which i guess is probably a worldwide record people participating from all over the world to inaudible our web conference i organized so the ultimate and we tried that inaudible way of communicating would be me being in multiple places at the same time which of course is impossible except by using technology so we tested that in a big conference we had in chicago i was in paris in my office we used this holographic technologies and so my hologram was in chicago delivering the conference so in that case it was only in one location now what i’m trying to do is to use my hologram at the same time in multiple locations so i can be in front of thousands of people without leaving my office sarah green carmichael that’s very cool so i’m interested as we’re talking about some of these big shifts obviously accenture part of what you’re company does is help other companies sort of adapt to this landscape but i’m also curious to know how it has changed in your business because when you think about consultants and people flying and traveling all over the world and also giving very personalized oneonone advice but obviously changes like big data and advanced analytics and cheaper computing power that sort of affects perhaps that business of advicegiving as well and then obviously business travel you just mentioned is totally being upended by some of these technologies as well so just tell me a little bit about how these shifts affect your business pierre nanterme sure i mean the consultancy business is in the midst of radical change and if i had to characterize the trend if you will it would be from issue to outcome this is what our clients want they want now a result so advisory services are not enough to create an impact in the marketplace and this is the evolution we’ve been driving at accenture is how to organize our company to create new capabilities so indeed we can commit on an outcome we can commit on the results while providing services from strategic consultancy services accenture strategy then we created accenture consulting to drive the transformation at our clients we have accenture digital where we have the capabilities to implement digital native solutions analytics mobility all the interactive we created accenture technology to leverage the best technology platforms and finally we have accenture operations where we operate on behalf of clients and by creating this suite of services we are relevant from the ideal generation the business case shaping the future to building and operating solutions and so delivering a measurable outcome it’s a massive revolution in our industry sarah green carmichael well and another change i was just reading about is you’ve actually changed the performance management system as well so you’ve just recently gone from an annual review system that is sort of the standard at many companies to something that’s sort of much more realtime tell us a little bit about that transformation pierre nanterme it’s a very big transformation and to be honest since it has been announced i have received tons of mail and requests for information on how you’re going to do it and i’m thinking that as it is overdue it seems that most of the companies large and small are looking for a new way of driving performance management and again at accenture we always want to be more at the front line of the change and testing on us the new ways of doing things the rationale behind is we’re working more and more with the famous millennium generation so people who are digital native they want to have realtime performance feedback they want to understand where they are what might happen what their future is and they want to understand that quickly in a very direct conversation and of course the standard annual interview doesn’t fit anymore that purpose so we decided to get back to something which we believe is going to be a more fitful purpose simpler and better for accenture the feedback going to be given real time after each projects or activities and for that of course digital will be extremely useful so all this feedback will be done and recorded on digital tablets smartphone or all devices so i’m with you we’re closing a job we have the conversation i can simply type the feedback on my tablet i don’t need to get to whatever any laptop or other bureaucratic tools and techniques that’s the point number one second we’re going to simplify the criteria over time in order to better evaluate people we piled     criteria we need to get back to what matters if you will in the context of your evaluation on your project and that shouldn’t be more than three or four metrics or criteria  is not better than four and finally it’s all delegation of authority we’ve become a big firm as i mentioned before and so we can’t manage performance management in a centralized way it’s becoming just too cumbersome and too bureaucratic so we are back to delegation of authority to the leaders leaders are evaluating their people through very simple but relevant criteria and doing that on the regular basis so you see there is nothing kind of breakthrough thinking but it’s the execution which is going to be extremely important and this is what our people want now sarah green carmichael well and i’m wondering as you’re talking about giving feedback to people and maybe just four very important dimensions what are the things that you look for in telling what are the things that you would be wanting to see in people that you’d be evaluating or hiring pierre nanterme what we want to measure is your capability ability to progress and to grow with your carrier and what we’ve seen over time that of course you can have data metrics but at the end of the day what’s important is to tell the person you’re working with where are you today are you relevant in your job or for your clients or for what you’re doing and as important what is your ability to grow and to grow your carrier so you see that of course some data might serve as a kind of baseline but at the end of the day it’s more evaluating the possibility of the people to grow and progress their carrier this is where we want to move the performance management process from just mining the data your revenues your profits or whatever or your performance has been moving from x to z from we believe that you have the potential to grow and develop based on your performance but based on your personality sarah green carmichael as we’re talking about some of these big changes that are happening at accenture and then also outside in the world of business i’m wondering how you see your role in all of this i know we have listeners and readers who are ceos we also have many people who are sort of aspiring to that role and i’m just wondering what is it that only someone really at your level can do pierre nanterme if i had to probably define and characterize my job and maybe the job of a ceo today in this global world highly volatile uncertain and when you need to transform is to be the catalyst for change that’s probably the definition i would give to my job i’m the catalyst i need to create the environment for the change and the transformation to happen and probably it’s a combo of three ingredients if you will it’s of course the vision you need to set the vision you need to set the purpose you need to bring people with you with a goal which is going to be compelling for them second is the motivation it’s creating a high level of engagement commitment and again the purpose is extremely important but the way of working what i described before we are a very open organization very flat easy access to the leaders regular dialogue highly digitally enabled between the people so you can reach anyone anywhere with just one touch and finally the execution the vision and the motivation are great but beyond that you need to get things done and make sure you execute it and i think the ceo of tomorrow they should have this agility from the big picture to monday morning agenda from setting the vision to measuring the results testing trying coming back and being the catalyst of that change in all this large organization sarah green carmichael i think that’s a great answer how do you find time to do all of that that’s my other question pierre nanterme the next point is about your leverage nothing is big enough there is no superman or superwoman on the planet only in the movies so then you’re getting back to the real world and when you’re setting all this vision motivation execution mindset of course and it’s always been the same you need to be surrounded by people who are much better than you and this is what i’m trying to do at accenture is to make sure i have the right team but we’ve said that a lot that you need to have the right people now the point is they need to be extraordinarily relevant for what they have to do we have different businesses at accenture we have different geographic leaders they all have a very specific mandate so it’s like a team everybody’s got a role that should be delivered with a sense of perfection and amazing commitment and of course with a very strong common culture sarah green carmichael well ok this will be my last question i could ask you questions all day but tell me a little bit about how you make that strong common culture because i think that is something that every leader just finds so challenging when it’s not there pierre nanterme at accenture i must recognize that we benefit from a long time from a very strong culture probably because we’ve never been through any significant big transformational acquisitions to be honest so we’ve been growing in an organic way for decades all the leaders are coming from the ranks so on the one hand you might argue you’re not bringing enough fresh blood maybe but on the other end you continue developing a very strong common culture we’ve been very stringent and very key in communicating our values and our principles and we are absolutely stringent and not for negotiation around our values if someone is not doing what’s right for our clients for our people or for our companies then we will take some very drastic action but we don’t want to deliver a culture of punishment but more for encouragement for instance in term of calling compliance which might be perceived as a constraint we call all this program conduct counts and i think it’s profound because what we’re trying to do at accenture is more to promote to support to explain what it takes to do the right thing– again for our people for our clients for our different stakeholders if you will– a cultural of openness not a culture of fear and making sure that the leaders are leaving our core values and are the best promoters of our culture it’s an every day task and it’s really a leader by leader time of commitment because at the end of the day this is what it is leaders lead sarah green carmichael well that’s an excellent reminder pierre thank you so much for coming in today i’ve really enjoyed our conversation pierre nanterme thank you sarah

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans

that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
