over to mr michael tardugno celsions chairman president and ceo mike michael tardugno thanks jeff good morning and i also want to thank all of you for joining us on todays call as always we are delighted to have the opportunity to update you on our progress and particularly now given all the positive developments that weve shared with you over this past quarter and id say this past year now please take some time to review todays press releases if you havent already done so i think they will give you a good breakdown on the progress the company has made in this last quarter here with me today are dr nicholas borys celsions chief medical officer and jeffrey church from whom youve just heard our chief financial officer todays call will focus on the two very important and id say highly promising clinical trials of our lead product candidates the first is our new adjuvant study in firstline ovarian cancer combining gen with standard of care therapy followed by interval debulking surgery gen is our promising genemediated immunotherapy the factored foundation is il supporting our program or encouraging orally studies that were pioneered by gog the gynecologic oncology group you know this to be a cooperative funded by dh ph to just give you an idea of the interest that the researchers and investigators at gog have had and continue to have in gen virtually all of them have signed up and are interested to sign up to participate and interested in our clinical trials the second indication the second trial is in primary liver cancer the optima study of firstline phase iii global study of thermodox in combination with radiofrequency ablation standardized to a minimum of  minutes of timing of where we now know this ablation technology is most effective in combining and combination with thermodox thermodox as you know is our elegant heat sensitive liposomal dosage form of doxorubicin i will also take some time to review with you the significance of our strategy with the chinese pharma company hisun and i have a few comments about expenses in cash management at the close so we have a lot to cover so i want to get right to it during the following months you know celsion is exceptionally well positioned with a solid balance sheet and clinical trials addressing two of the most globally prevalent cancers of our lifetime both recognized as being indications with high unmet needs ovarian cancer for example is the eight most diagnosed cancer among women with a quarter of million global new cases every year virtually every one of us knows or knows someone who mother and daughter sister grandmother or friends life has been shorter by this malignancy and primary to liver cancer by  with  incidences growing at  annually it will be the worlds number one cancer according to the world health organization our incremental advances in interventional techniques have improved overall survival somewhat in this indication hcc remains the largest unmet need in oncology today so its clear to me and i trust to you that celsions work is off significance important medicine and mutations ph worldwide and if were right should our clinical research be successful in either of both indications not only will we bring ground breaking therapies to physicians and patients well be looking at new drug entities each with billion dollar revenue potential so as arising in the question we could ask will we be right the answer to that question of course is the subject of our clinical research but we can say now however and well allow and share with you its based on yearly evidence perhaps remarkable evidence we have every reason to believe that we will be successful let me start with gen and ovarian cancer now bear with me some of you may be new to the story im going to go into some detail as you may know immunotherapy has taken a premier position in oncology research largely based on what  years ago would have been called miraculous i mean all the big companies and a number of small development stage companies are involved with immunooncology research and so the new york times and its above the full series suggest that new oncology maybe the key to successful cancer treatments of the future now we call of our entry into this future of medicine gen gen is a genemediated immunotherapeutic which we put virtually all the mechanisms of the immune system to fight cancer gens foundation is the dna plasmid coded for cytokine approaching cytokine interlukin il as its called is the plasma thats incorporated into the nonviral nanoparticle system its a proprietary system called theraplas thats used to deliver this plasma into a viable healthy and diseased cells when this is administered the system is administered locally into a body cavity it could be into the peritoneum of the gut the bladder even the cavity that is created by the surgical removal of tumor mass nanoparticles invade the local original cells taking over the metabolic machinery of the cell turning each into a factory for sustained local production of the il protein just visualize that with me if you will so now you have got the cells high il and sustaining therapeutic quantities the question is how il affects the immune system so i will talk little bit about that il is an inflammatory protein or a cytokine as considered by many to be a master switch of the immune system and as historically has been recognized there is a great deal of research on this as one of the powerful immunotherapies and oncology it functions at multiple levels first it takes to break up the immune system and you probably know these cancer cells are smart they create an environment by upregulating something called the treg ph cells which put the brakes on the immune system so one of the first actions or one of the first mechanisms the il has to down regulate these treg cells which takes the breaks of the immune system secondly it upregulates the production of the interferons interferon has the effect of inhibiting blood vessel growth and third and fourth it powers up the immune system it puts the inept and tumor specific cell mediated immune activities into overdrive so this we know we have known them since the s question is why hasnt it been developed further and thats really a function of the pharmacokinetics of interleukin its utility as a therapeutic has been compromised by a serious toxicities associated with a very short halflife or poor pharmacokinetics as the scientists recall it as the physicians recall it its very short halflife requires very high doses of il in order for it to be have a chance to be effective in stimulating the immune system but in high doses it can be seriously toxic il for the most part has been on the shelf for twenty or more years now we have gen gen has been specifically designed to overcome these limitations these limitations are short halflife and poor pharmacokinetics by promoting the production of endogenous il endogenous meaning body produced itself as we described it by invading cells with this il plasmid il is then produced in a controlled and localized manner in a delivery factor in this nonviral nanoparticle whilst for repeated administration and in effect maintenance therapy so we can repeatedly administer il or gen to produce il and as result continuously stimulate the immune system to effectively treat cancers so where is the proof in addition to some impressive clinical findings translational data from our december  gog study in platinumresistant ovarian cancer patients this translational data earlier data were announced earlier this year we demonstrate that interferonnewly administered gen appears to live up to its designed promise pathology histology and analytic results from a patient trials confirm the production of an immunologically distinct il protein it is localized in the tumor in its vicinity it lasts for up to  week after a single treatment additionally dose dependent on increases in interferon we talked about an interferon and tnf tumor necrosis factor indicates that the il produced is immunologically active importantly the absence of overlapping toxicities allow for combination therapies our target indication is we have been talking is ovarian cancer or the resistant urgent need for new treatment options again  million new patients are diagnosed every year with  year survival less than  and because it is symptomatic and its in stages patients are often diagnosed as difficult to manage stage   stage  this is our current target population we call our trial on this population the ovation study ovation was initiated in quarter  last year and is expected to be completed by the end of this year its a phase i dose escalation trial a newly diagnosed stage  and stage  ovarian cancer patients these patients present with a great deal of disease in their belly as a great deal of cancer in the peritoneum so prior to debulking they are treated with multiple courses typically treated with multiple courses of platinum and taxane the goal of which is to improve the surgical outcome by shrinking and drying the disease tissue so in our trial to this regiment we are adding  weekly cycles of gen that then is followed by interval debulking surgery the trial is designed to enroll  to  patients per cohort as the dose escalation study increasing the dose by  with each escalation its goal is to evaluate safety and efficacy as well as defining an optimal dose for an upcoming registrational program that we are looking forward to evaluating gen in combination with avastin and doxil well talk more about that in a minute ovations pis are currently treating  patients in the third cohort so we have completed cohort   cohort  and now in the third cohort assuming no dlts dose limiting toxicities in september we will ask the dsmv to allow for the fourth and final cohort in the meantime we have reported very id say very encouraging results from the six patients in the first two groups and we announced that in a press release i want to quote the lead principal investigator dr premal thaker associate professor in gynecologic oncology at washington university school of medicine and she as i said is our new lead investigator and i quote “the totality did available todate from the first six patients suggests that gen holds great promise great potential its service is effective safe il immunotherapy in ovarian cancer we have seen dramatic decreases of  or greater in a cancer antigen  protein levels in all subjects which served as a key indicator of the presence of ovarian cancer cells as well as impressive pathological response data which is associated with prolonged survival we look forward to the completion of the study and learning more about how gen performs in this population” so let me talk a little bit more about the findings from these first six patients so in addition to what dr thaker points out the reduction in every case    reduction in every case is ca and by the way a  reduction is considered to be clinically significant in addition to this reduction in ca we get reports from radiologists from the surgeons and from the pathologists from the radiologists of the six patients involved we observed  disease control rate with one patient demonstrating a complete response of cr two patients a partial response and three patients demonstrating a stable disease and its population of what we expected a  or less disease control rate from the surgeons surgical assessment five patients had successful resection of their tumors two patients having an r which indicates a microscopically negative margin resection which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the tumor bay and we have three patients with an r indicating microscopic residual disease now the one patient in the second cohort that was ineligible for debulking surgery was of course ineligible due to a medical complication unrelated to the study and we have report from the pathologist and this may be the most impressive of the five surgically treated patients one patient demonstrated a pathological complete response a pcr two patients with  demonstrated a micropathological response a micropr and two patients demonstrated a macropr these data compare favorably to historical data which indicate that pcrs are typically seen in less than  of the patients receiving new vitamin chemotherapy followed by surgical resection pcrs have been associated with a median overall survival of  months which is more than three years longer than those who do not experience pcr in addition microprs are seen in approximately  of the patients and are associated with a median overall survival of  months so we find our physicians find the clinicians involved find these results to date in a small population to be extraordinary but before you can expect clinical findings from the third cohort patients being currently treated in the fourth cohort if its allowed by the dsmv will be announced as soon as the data is available we will provide that along with translational results then from the tissue samples that have been taken from these patients in september and again study them for us and under leadership of dr borys we believe that continued strong data suggests us to celsion to expand the trial of the therapeutic dose maybe the appropriate strategy to accelerate development we will see we have requested and have been granted a telephone meeting with the fda to review this option along with discussion of an appropriate study and plan so fingers crossed our continued strong data may result in the expansion of the current trial which as you know continued trial is much more time effective than completing a small phase i study and stopping and restarting other trials so inertia is not on our side continuing to study will allow us to enroll patients without interruption and expansion of the trial in the meantime however you know that we have been interested in combining gen with avastin and doxil doxil being ubiquitous in oncology its a  billion therapeutic preclinical data showing extraordinary tumor inhibition was presented from our frequent research at aacr the data showed that the three drug combination avastin and doxil and gen demonstrated the statistically significant greater than  reduction in tumor burden as compared to control and a statistically significant greater than  reduction in tumor burden as compared to the combination of avastin and doxil alone impressive enough that few big pharma companies picked up the phone as there is more about it assuming we have a dose invasion ph we remain ontrack for an ind submission for a phase ii clinical trial or recur ovarian cancer thats the one we just talked about avastin doxil and gen by the end of this year in support of our strategy to develop gen as a global therapy this is important its not to be missed its an announcement that we made with the zhejiang hisun pharma company for the production of gen production and global supply of gen this agreement provides for tech transfer and i can say at a very reasonable cost it also provides clinical commercial supply prices are prices to celsion although have a lot of celsion to answer virtually every world market an expectation of significant gross margins an enormous advantage in what we are seeing and i know other companies are also is with all this research now focusing on biologics limited capacity to produce these type of investigational products prices are going up dramatically we saw this coming folks and so about  or  months ago we began a process of more cost effective very high quality supply importantly prices for genuine to supply our clinical trials will be affordable almost well i am sorry i cant give too much away but believe me the prices for clinical trial supplies will be a fraction of the cost of what we or other companies are currently experiencing the move to hisun was carefully considered from our past work with them we do know that this is a company with state of the art manufacturing and with an excellent quality reputation and ethics in return for this deal which seems to be so favorable to advantage the celsion and our shareholders we have committed the certain percentage a percentage certain of the commercial volume of gen so its approved that i can ensure you that we will always maintain two if not three suppliers so in summary let me just summarize gen its one of the most exciting areas of therapeutic development in a generation really results treating phase iii and iv ovarian cancer patients are nothing short of remarkable our future trails for the past component of gen with the most successful oncologic advance in the  billion drug as i said and we are positioning gens cost structure to support global markets i hope you feel good about gen we do now to thermodox our most advanced product candidate now in a phase iii study over onethird in a row evaluating our well founded thesis that rfa administered for a minimum of  minutes will significantly improve overall survival and newly diagnosed primary liver cancer or hcc patients the evidence here is mainly that rfa a standard interventional firstline treatment for hcc if used within its engineered limitations will mediate a clinically effective local concentration of doxorubicin when combined with thermodox i will remind you this is not a conclusion that was derived simply from the subgroup analysis of the heat study data far from it weve done a great deal of work here it has been all but confirmed than a perspective preclinical study work a human equivalent dose of thermodox was evaluated during rfa heating times and healthy in liver of healthy pigs clearly clearly  and this is published report longer heating terms resolves in a significant increase in dox concentration around as in tissue this supported by a computational model funded by the nih through creda ph independently developed by world recognized research where the university of south carolina medical school again showing the value of longer heating times it was evaluated in a multivariate cox regression analyses guided by one of the most important names in hcc research where we concluded it was determined was significant that healing time only is responsible for the dramatic improvement and overall survival in heat study subgroup so this thesis has been presented and challenged that  it presented four challenge at six international medical conferences and through studyspecific symposia the conclusion from all these presentations is we are on the right track we get a great deal of support from the hcc research community for the optima study last quarter i referred to  i referred you to an article that was written by our own dr borys in the online journal of advanced healthcare network entitled testing a cure for hepatocellular carcinoma analyzing the use of lysothermally sensitive liposomal doxorubicin a link to this article is posted on our website i encourage you to read it  excuse me the basis for our confidence in the optima study some of which i just covered i believe you will all appreciate his insights more recently in june ricardo ph and some of his fellows are again looking at our data and our thesis were pleased to announce the expansion of peer reviewed research report supporting the findings from our hstudy it was reported in the medical journal of hepatic oncology publishing a comprehensive overview of each study most notably highlighting the curative potential underlined of thermodox and primary liver cancer the article detailed many of the insights obtained from the heat study particularly the posthoc analysis the basis for the optima study the group that we had been following which reinforces the potential efficacy of thermodox and its principal mechanism of action affirming that increased tissue exposure to heat will amplify the tissues concentration of doxorubicin and now for the past three years weve been following this well balanced well bonded subgroup of patients from the heat study who rfa treatment time was greater than  minutes this morning once again now for the eight time we presented findings from this three year followup announcing that the data continue to show us statistically significant improvement in overall survival consistent with so far a two year median survival benefit from treatment with thermodox plus optimized rfa thats greater than  minutes rfa and when i say so far is because we  keeping in this thermodox plus  minutes rfa we still havent seen they breach immediate and these patients are living more than  months we try draw the line item would be more than  months we will see i mean weve completed our overall survival suites over working with delivery ph how significant this is since optimistic so i think its  we choose to close down the study now after three years from the initial announcement so bottom line here we know more about rfa and intermediate stage hcc than just about any company on the planet youve heard me say that before but we know that rfa must be used within its engineered design limitations to be effective for tumors greater than three centimeters the treatment time becomes exceedingly important when we add thermodox to a procedure of  minutes or greater the outcome is extraordinary so with conviction i say on behalf of my colleagues here and our research is with conviction we are continuing to execute our phase iii optima study in primary liver cancer just quickly on the design and  ive talked a lot about this and you probably know it but the optima study is powered and designed in a way to set thermodox combination with rfa plus  minutes thats  and all investigators and all sites we control for that heating time in lesions three to seven centimeters and thats where we believe thermodox can be the most effective versus standardize rfa alone the study is planned to enroll  patients globally and upto  sites we continue to enroll sites were not looking to expand our study into vietnam where hcc is an erythema ph i mean its a major problem we have clinical sites in north america as we said europe asia pacific and china china representing an extraordinary market opportunity for  of the worlds incidence over  new cases diagnosed every year were expecting strong participation from the chinese and were starting together now with the cohort  the study cohort and china is up in the line with the basis for the study weve talked about  patients that represent  of the heat study  subjects not an insignificant number the most recent data suite this morning just little bit more detail on that  weve alluded to it it shows that overall survival in the thermodox plus standardized thats  minutes rfa arm maybe significantly greater than  months which by any standard and measure should be or would be considered conserved curative and an indication where curative treatments in patients within immediate sized lesions are unprecedented to be clear thermodox plus standardized rfa shows an improvement in the subgroup consistent with a twoyear plus benefit over all current interventional procedures rfa plus  minutes alone and key mobilization and radiation strategies a benefit of twoyear plus over everything thats being evaluated or used to treat patients newly diagnosed and for successful i can say one more thing here the strategic positioning of our global clinical trial sites will allow for filings and approval in all major markets including china southeast asia south korea the european union canada and united states small company but the global ambition for thermodox and you can say we just talked about our positioning or global strategy for gen also i want to make one more point here and this maybe a little bit premature with regards to the heat study and thermodox but we also  i think i mentioned this before looking forward to an independent confirmation of our hypothesis that longer heating time when activating thermodox translated into significant improvement in overall survival at celsion as you probably know has accredited with the nih under which the three terabytes of data from the heat study the entire country population has been independently analyzed by the researchers at nih i understand the findings will be ready for presentation in an upcoming medical conference if consistent with our thesis support from our study will be unprecendented so in summary primary liver cancer represents the largest unmet medical need in oncology we are committed to fully exploring the potential of thermodox which has demonstrated thus far and we are pleased with further progress weve seen in our optima trial and remain ontrack to complete enrollment andor in or around the end of  followed by a preplanned interim efficacy analysis hopefully the first and only but we have two preplanned in the study followed by the preplanned interim efficacy analysis read on in  ill just quickly in addition optima as you know that weve been advancing a program in recurrent chest wall breast cancer finding supporting in our european dignity study are extraordinary and were presented at the san antonio breast cancer conference if you need a demonstration of the value of thermodox just look at the pictures on our left side whoever ph have been treated with refractory disease these terrible lesions spreading on their chest treated with thermodox and three cycles or four cycles in some cases saving a complete response although tumor being resolved the healthy tissue replacing the diseased tissue we note that in this highly refractory group of patients that put calling your life and little bit treatment options result in very very poor existence and so fda has agreed with us that local tumor control in this population provides benefit sufficient to warrant a registrational application if were successful the challenge has been enrolling patients in the us so weve gone to europe as you know weve talked about new dignity studies expected to start up in quarter three of this year has been slowed down a little bit mostly because of our focus on gen and the optima study again we expect to be up and running at quarter three this is a simon twostage i believe patient study we expect the first interim efficacy and futility analysis by mid on the schedule that we are currently looking at so we remain very excited about the therapeutic programs and our potential and look forward  really look forward to presenting update since weve progressed in advancing our pipeline so with that im going to turn the call over to jeff who will review our financial results and then ill come back with a few final comments before questions jeff jeffrey church thank you mike our balance sheet is well capitalized we continue to operate in an efficient manner we ended the second quarter with over  million of total cash and investments compared to  million in cash at the end of  in june we completed a small registered direct stock offering yielding gross proceeds for the company  million while we were hopeful of raising more capital in this very difficult market we were also mindful of dilution to our shareholders so we opted for the current financing structure to minimize that warrant coverage the offering was completed with one institutional investor who led the option to acquire an additional  million during the first half of  if our share price improves in line with anticipated development milestones we expect in the second half of this year for the second quarter ended june   we reported a net loss of  million or  per share compared to a net loss of  million or  per share in the second quarter of  for the six months ended june  of this year we reported a net loss of  million or  per share that compares to  million loss in last year for the same six month period cash used for operations in the first half of  was  million that compares to  million in the same period last year which is down over  of this  million decrease was the result of cost reduction efforts implemented last year a tighter product development focus and prudent cash management we operated with a lean organizational structure with over  of our spending is directed to research and development activities historically our cash usage in the first quarter of each year is the highest due to certain onetime payments we expect our quarterly cash used for operations be approximately  million for the balance of the year we continue to monitor our cash expense just to ensure the most efficient use of cash to create shareholder value rd cost was  million in the second quarter of  compared to  million last year rd cost was  million in the first half of  that compares to  million for the same period last year our rd expenditures this year will be focused on the continued enrollment and treatment of patients and in the phase iii optimal study the enrollment of patients in the phase i of ovation study using gen to treat ovarian cancer can push your preclinical ind supporting studies for gen in combination with doxil and avastin in plasmid resistant ovarian cancer and the production of clinical supplies to support the clinical initiatives general  administrative expenses were  million in the second quarter of this year compared to  million last year ga costs were  million in the first half of  compared to  million last year this decrease was primarily the result of lower insurance premiums lower personnel and operating costs resulting from the reorganization and staff reductions announced in the second half of last year and a tighter clinical development focus on these programs that we believe will drive shareholder value in the near term through the first planned interim readout of the pivotal phase iii optimal study anticipated in  i will now turn the call back to michael michael tardugno well thank you jeff we always appreciate your comments i would like to make one last point before moving on to questions and i think it follows on to very nicely to what john is talking about with our earnings announcement we note that our yearoveryear expenses have decreased by  once you know we continue to be vigilant looking for opportunities to ensure efficient cash utilization while at the same time focusing our resources on value creating progress so continue to evaluate our current organizational structure and align our resources and clinical programs with our near term development objectives and without sacrificing our overall strategy we have tightened and developed our focus on optima and dignity for thermodox in advancing gen cancer as a result of these actions we hope to realize additional cost reductions and annual operating expenses in the second half of  our goal is to ensure sufficient runway to achieve milestones of significance so now with that those are our prepared remarks i would like to ask the operator to open the lines for your questions i ask that you limit your questions to no more than two to provide everyone an opportunity to participate so operator if you would open the line for question i would appreciate it thank you questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question today is from jason mccarthy from maxim group please go ahead jason mccarthy hi guys thanks for taking the questions michael can you just give us an update on the enrollment in the optimal study you know what percent of the study has been enrolled do you remain on track to complete enrollment next year and just thought i will stick in the second question now jumping over to gen i know you have the third cohort of patients who have been treated can you give us a sense of when we could see the data from that cohort and when we are going to see histology data will it include t cells and the full immune profile thanks guys michael tardugno okay so let me start with your first question i think in my prepared remarks i announced jason that we were well over a third enrolled in the study we continue to add new investigative sites and we have about  of the chinese sites up are running and the balance of the sites another  or  will be on board over the next few months in addition to that we have been exploring vietnam and concluded that the standard of care the quality of medicine the capability of researchers in vietnam to participate successfully in the phase iii study is consistent with our objectives we will be adding hopefully before the end of the year maybe leading it to next year  sites in vietnam perhaps some additional sites in europe all that said is we are on track we expect to have approximately  enrollment by the end of this year and we are on a pace that appears that we are going to we are going to meet that the overall objective is to complete the enrollment of the study by the end of  or could squeak into early  but at the moment thats where we are with regards to enrollment we are not giving specific numbers we think it provides too much opportunity for some inappropriate conclusions with regards to the value or potential of the study and our dmc doesnt like it frankly with regards to the third cohort as you know we have identified three patients they are being treated the course of treatment extends over to an  week to  week period followed by surgery the surgery that occurs usually within a week or two following chemotherapy and immunotherapy so at the earliest that we would be reporting the clinical results from these patients probably the end of september early october in the meantime with regards to translational data we are looking at into two chunks i guess best way to say it we have submitted the our tissue samples from the first six patients to indiscernible where the translational data is being evaluated and the tissues being analyzed from the translational data it will take four or five more weeks before we have that available to us and the reports have been quality assured or checked for quality so i would suspect at this point probably september before the first look at the translational data for six patients our translational data from the entire study given that we decided to move to fourth cohort we originally had conceived this trial to be three cohorts three dose increasing cohorts the fourth one now and the encouragement of our investigators will the enrollment rate will complete the enrollment in probably treating patients high into january of next year then you could expect about six weeks before translational data so if i got there right probably end of february early march for the translational data from all patients that have been treated in the ovation study does that answer your question jason mccarthy it does thank you for taking the questions michael tardugno thank you operator and next from griffin securities we have keith markey keith markey thanks for taking my questions i was just wondering given the data you had so far in the first two quarters looks quite impressive could you give us the thought on that what you might be doing in the next clinical trial of gen michael tardugno so i am going to start this answer and i am going to ask nick to jump in because i am going to miss some of it i am seeing the ninth commission in the room here seems to me that we are seeing such a dramatic response from the first six patients if it continues keith and if we can develop with fda an endpoint that gives us the reasonable assumption that we can read these study results in a reasonable amount of time it would make sense to us to continue the current new adjuvant study in an expansion format  expanding to a phase ii at the dose or maybe with as many as  patients but that will depend on some agreement with fda i know our investigators are there nick do you have nicholas borys yes keith this is nick i think these are exciting times for the new adjuvant program as you know we get very interesting data from the baseline on these patients and then at the time of debulking we get the tissue samples as well so as mike said we are going to be in discussions with the fda for the most efficient way to move forward in these studies so i think you just have to keep an eye on our announcements in the future as we feel with discussions but with this early data i would imagine we should have some pretty interesting designs coming in the near future keith markey great thanks and then… michael tardugno sorry i just want to add to that i hope you dont mind keith assuming we have full support from the fda we are not going to assume a lot of risks without support from the fda it doesnt make any sense to us and once we have complete support we will continue our current strategy which is to establish in dose this new edge of a study use that as a starting dose in plasmid resistant patients second line combining gen with avastin and doxil which is the standard of care in these patients who have failed the first line of treatment so that would be we would be making the announcement i am sure following our conversations and discussions with the fda certainly before the end of the year keith markey great thanks and then as for the followup i was just wondering if you could give us an update on the early access program for thermodox michael tardugno yes sure i think we have seen a great deal of interest in investigators like the biggest challenge for us with the early access program has been to negotiate all pricing that works for us and for the investigators we continue to explore options to make the early access program successful and not a cash problem a cash generator for the company and so thats about mike thats something we can give you at this point this early access program is important to the company and important to medicine and certainly to patients we know that thermodox incorporates doxorubicin which has been an oncologic agent for generations our safety profile is consistent with doxorubicin if not mildly better using thermodox in patients with primary liver cancer has only upside only upside as we see it and i think in amongst positions to have been introduced to our eap ph the problem  there is a problem it comes down to pricing in here we have to be very careful that we dont set a price ceiling by providing a discount for thermodox in the early access program and thats about what we are dealing with at this point keith markey thank you operator and our next question is from ramekin ph from hc wainwright unidentified analyst thank you this is rk from hcw how are you doing mike this morning just a couple of question in the heat study data you announced this morning i believe the chinese cohort represents close to the treatment parallel of optima if thats true then whats the survival benefit you saw in the chinese cohort and is there a meeting or publication that you have been doing where you can present the full data set from this new analysis michael tardugno yes nick do you want to take that nicholas borys yes i think your question is what is the survival data in the chinese cohort so the statistics in the when you break them out for the chinese patients we have well over  patients in the chinese cohort which is at that point gives us regulatory muscle and in china is consistent with the overall cohort and so if you look at the overall data that mike discussed early in his presentation its consistent with that but by itself as a small breakout we dont have the number the numbers are little bit more unstable than the overall cohort so all i can say is that its consistent unidentified analyst okay michael tardugno i would say i would like to add to that a little bit if i can please so part of our strategy in working with hisun is to have a local manufacturer for thermodox and i can say just as i sat here the product manufactured by hisun is good as anything if not better than anything that weve produced in the us stateoftheart manufacturing high quality and cost that provide us with gross margin potential and just works for every major market that said there are two pathways as you probably know for registering a drug in china one is a multinational company typically requires a cpp or certificate of pharmaceutical product from an approving agency outside of china along with the data from a global study next typically those global studies as you know are empowered for a pvalue and clinical benefit that is acceptable clinical benefit the other approach in china  any quest around that track we have a global study in progress called the optima study the other approach is submission as a local manufacturer and thats along the values of working with company like hisun as a local manufacturer assuming we have a commercial license with them and thats a big assumption at this point we  i believe that although the data is not enough its not powered enough from the chinese cohort there is only plus patients its not powered enough for statistical significance i believe as nick pointed out the results are generally consistent with the subgroup that weve been  the largest subgroup that weve been following so that implies a twoyear plus survival benefit so we believe that there is enough here there is enough evidence here we have a local supplier doxorubicin is an approved drug in china in their dosage form improved significantly and its valued to treat a highly profuse organ like the liver hcc is a major problem in china if we have support from our chinese manufacturing partner we are likely to present evidence to the cfda that we believe that there may be an opportunity for some consideration of  i dont know pv condition or some kind of opportunity to bring thermodox to market in china sooner rather than later so thats really what were looking at in this dataset we can provide you with a little bit more detail from the chinese dataset we do have some upcoming medical conferences it may make sense to break out separately although its going to be  has been working with medical conferences and skeptical oncologists who are all trained to be skeptical god knows they should be when you present small datasets a pvalue then it becomes sometimes a debate that you dont want to have so i hope that answers your question we really go through the heart of whats the value of the chinese cohort at this point unidentified analyst thank you and then on the new dignity study can you define for us the design and the endpoints that you have in the study again i think you us in the opening remarks but when is it that well start seeing some additional data michael tardugno ill answer the last question first you should begin to see treating patients its not a labelled study its powered with i believe  patients as the physicians become comfortable with the findings and per patient basis for happy to report the results as we go the trials are organized little bit differently than the dignity study in the us these are patients who are little bit earlier in the treatment of their recurrence but they are still eligible for radiation so this study is designed as a trimural therapy its a chemotherapy plus thermal therapy plus radiation being the new addition the study will begin enrolling somewhere in the last chance here of completing some of the regulatory submissions the study should begin enrolling patients in the fourth quarter at the latest and hopefully well begin to present results as were going to be treating patients up to six cycles  six weekly cycles and then assessed for tumor response so it could be by the end of the year or early next year were reporting findings from a patient an individual patient individual cases the endpoints in the study are many fold and maybe nick if you remember the endpoints can you talk about that please nicholas borys yes so as mike alluded to the basic design of the study is that were looking now at patients that are initially diagnosed with recurrent chest wall disease and currently the standard of care in these patients is to give them radiation  external radiation and you typically see maybe around a  response rate in these patients we believe we can improve that once you add heat and thermodox to that so the study is designed to look at those response rates we have assigned a twostage design its a phase ii singlearm study and i think well be seeing results as mike said relatively soon and i think it will be a nice boost to see greater response rates in this difficulttotreat population unidentified analyst okay thank you very much michael tardugno so operator we have time for one more question operator and that will be from barry rubin with arsenal investments barry rubin hi good morning thank you again for the great progress and hopefully more people will see it and it was a pleasure meeting you at the annual meeting just one quick question to end the hour the company if im correct about a year ago i went to the previous meeting said that maybe in the future at some point that wed be getting a collaboration with all the great news on gen whats holding it up i mean im probably missing something and youll elucidate further but do you see anything perhaps happening this year or what holding back a nice collaboration with somebody michael tardugno okay thats a good question its not for a lack of interest i think we take calls regularly and we have an outreach program also some business development mode presenting of the opportunity for both indications for both drugs both gen and thermodox i can tell you we have interest and i can tell you that that interest translates into ongoing discussions the reason for if i could generalize here the reason that we havent proceeded further one and with thermodox we have something to prove to be honest with you barry its a  but the point i was making in my prepared remarks here is that this is not just a subgroup thesis that supports our optima study we have completely encircled this hypothesis with every means to validate it that we can  we could possibly bring to bear here notwithstanding that i think we find companies  large pharma companies need a little more reassurance and i think thats coming with regards to gen we might be a little early in the development cycle the first study is at phase i so dont give up hope were  we see more human data our interest in gen continues well continue to grow on that the area where we had the most hope well i guess the most progress was with the third platform that we did not talk about this morning and thats with therasilence this is a platform that provides lungspecific delivery of rna therapeutics for a variety of indications oncology and otherwise and we have some very solid data preclinical data for the most part in nonhuman primates and a variety of small animals supported with peerreviewed publications weve had more than one very interesting collaborations ones still ongoing evaluating the rna therapy where we dont own the rna ip its owned by the development companies the rna therapeutic in an oncology setting a lung cancer setting weve been evaluating it collaboratively and theres always the potential here that that will result in the kind of meaningful partnership that weve been talking about barry rubin okay thank you ever so much michael tardugno so i think that given its  oclock and theres no burning questions were going to conclude this call with a sincere thank you to all of you who participated and i want you to know that we truly value the support that we get from our shareholders and your interest in the company we look forward to providing you updates on thermodox and gen and the rest of our research as the company progresses in these critical areas of oncology research so you can expect from us a continued dialogue through press releases and we look forward to talking with you on our next quarterly conference call thank you very much and with that were concluded thank you operator thank you this concludes todays call
