 bookmark this page    manage my reading list in some editions of walden there is included an inscription page which precedes the first chapter on this page the narrator of walden declares i do not propose to write an ode to dejection but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning standing on his roost if only to wake my neighbors up the reader attempting to approach an understanding and appreciation of walden should immediately note that here in this inscription the germ of the book may be found the tone is one of great confidence and joy the pages to follow will be the narrators optimistic proclamation of the richness and fullness of his life at walden pond he will brag lustily with a fullthroated voice that he like the rooster that greets the dawn has successfully created a way of living that has enabled him to find a new day in his life it is a new world and a new self that he has discovered through his thought and activity at his woodland retreat he feels as though he has been reborn into a fresh and new more satisfying life he celebrates the feeling of having left behind his old self the spiritually asleep creature made lifeless by the dead dry life of society for the sake of a new and ecstatic spiritual life in light of what has been said about thoreaus transcendentalism one might rightly expect walden to begin on just such a note of buoyancy and highspiritedness this is a fitting way to begin the artistic depiction of how one man moved away from the state of being a god in ruins and moved toward a godlike state of fulfillment thus commences one of the most sophisticated and artistic brags in the history of american literature and before the student decides to term the book the work of a rabid egomaniac a further word about the nature of this brag should be offered in the american scholar emerson described the three basic stages of a transcendentalists life first he learns all that is of merit in the wisdom of the past second he establishes a harmonious relationship with nature through which he is able to discover ethical truths and communicate with the divine with these two stages the transcendentalist has developed his higher faculties he has cultivated his life and spiritualized it we see the narrator of walden go through these two stages in his progress toward spiritual rebirth after thus cultivating his own spirit the transcendentalist does not selfishly remain content with himself the third stage he must attempt after selfrenewal is the renewal of societyatlarge after being nurtured by books and nature he must attempt to share his spiritual gains with other men who have not yet achieved their perfect spiritual states walden may be viewed as thoreaus attempt at this third stage in the transcendental life in it we hear the bragging narrator reiterating the firm conviction that all men may achieve the exhilaration that he feels he vividly shows us his life he brags of his achievement and he tries by his example to renew the dead dry life of society thus when the narrator brags it is not only for himself but for all humanitys potential for greatness like the other transcendentalists thoreau was a strong moralist and one of the most distinctive characteristics of walden is that the narrator consistently tries to alert his readers to their potential for spiritual growth so while the narrator may crow loudly sometimes proudly strutting about and may boast of his clear flame with a degree of pride approaching hubris it should not be forgotten that his selfpride is to be shared by his readers if the narrator sometimes seems smug and selfrighteous it must be recalled that he is crowing to wake his neighbors up to their own greatness not just his own the narrators celebration of life and his call for all men to recognize the potential magnificence of life form the core idea or unifying theme of walden this point cannot be stressed too strongly because for over a century many individuals — sometimes very intelligent ones — have tended to ignore this centrally significant fact and have chosen to view walden in other ways while one considers the different aspects of walden these aspects should not obscure the essential core of the book the process by which the narrator moves toward spiritual fulfillment the way in which the reader can keep this core foremost in his mind is to approach walden as what it primarily is a carefully contrived closelyknit work of art with a poetic structure designed to support and restate the core idea this may easily be done if the reader predisposes himself to two facts the first is that before anything else thoreau was an artist — an artist above and beyond being a devotee of nature a naturalist an economist an anarchist an abolitionist or a philosopher since the s this is the key fact about thoreau that has been established by scholars and it has been the key factor in thoreaus rise to prominence in american letters walden is the product of a man possessed with the idea of creating a great book the second fact is that walden was thoreaus most successful attempt at creating art to the degree that walden exhibits the qualities of a great poem if one traces the process by which thoreau transformed his first version of walden into the final version this may be done by consulting j lyndon shanleys the making of walden he can see the work being changed from a rough report on pondside living to a highly compressed complex and symbolic work of art of course one can grasp the central theme of walden without taking too much note of the poetic structure of the work if one takes the attitude that one critic has — that walden is a collection of eighteen essays recounting thoreaus experience at walden pond near concord massachusetts from july   to september   — it would still be possible to come to the theme of walden but to view the work as merely a collection of essays is to miss the rich texture that thoreau gave the work as a whole the organic poetic unity and the rich symbolic structure which thoreau created in walden is what makes it a work far superior to his other works which present almost identical themes and it is only by being aware of the symbolic structure that one can discover how the fiction of thoreaus walden is ultimately autobiographical it is through the symbolism that one comes to see that walden is thoreaus artistic projection of his most deeply felt shortcomings and needs — psychological needs that are fulfilled in the fiction that thoreaus narrator lives the term fiction is used here to describe the narrators record of what happened to him at walden pond both the i voice of the narrator and the world he describes must be distinguished from the real thoreau and the world that he inhabited while writing walden walden is a fiction an imaginative creation it is not a strict autobiography in the sense that we usually assign to that word the i voice we hear bragging as lustily as chanticleer in the morning is thoreaus representation of himself in  as he would like to be as he hopes to be someday or it is an older thoreaus representation of the ecstasy that he felt when he was younger in writing walden he is seeking to assert and perhaps recapture his former happiness it should never be forgotten that seven years separated the actual experience at walden pond and the publication of walden as many critics have contended those seven years witnessed thoreaus loss of the intense inspiration and the ecstasy in nature that characterized his youth in  thoreau was looking backward to his years of spiritual fulfillment before his highly subjective idealism had begun to wane and he is hopefully looking forward to regaining it in short walden is a kind of wish book with the i voice of walden thoreau fabricates an ideal alterego a wishfulfillment figure a character who is able to say the things about himself that thoreau would like to be able to claim in his youth thoreau felt a terrific sense of inspiration and wholeness whenever he was in the presence of nature he believed that he had empirically proven the tenet of emersonian idealism that the divine may be experienced through the medium of nature in fact thoreau was so excited so exhilarated by his sensual and spiritual experience of nature that he seriously entertained the idea that nature is actually god he went past emerson who declared that nature is the symbol of the spiritual and proposed that it is more than a mere symbol in a week on the concord and merrimack rivers thoreaus idealism surpassed emersons when he wrote may we not see god are we to be put off and amused in this life as it were with mere allegory is not nature rightly read that of which she is commonly taken to be the symbol merely statements such as this caused reverend george ripley to denounce thoreaus pantheism nature fulfilled him to such a degree that he had to celebrate it as divine so great was the physical and spiritual harmony between him and nature that he felt he was experiencing divinity and it was to this state that he wanted to return in  hence at the climax of the narrators quest for harmony with nature in the spring chapter we find the i voice experiencing natures expression of the divine the ecstasy that the i voice brags of in this chapter is the ecstasy that thoreau longs for the spiritual rebirth that the narrator achieves in walden is the goal toward which thoreau was attempting to design his life in  previous next chapter  pop quiz in the

transcendentalist movement extraliterary recognition of thoreau study help quiz essay questions cite this literature note henry david thoreau biography    bookmark this page    manage my reading list henry david thoreau was born on july   of rather ordinary parents in concord outside of boston massachusetts his childhood and adolescence from what little is known about these periods of his life appear to have been typical for the time thoreau attended the concord academy as an undistinguished student and when he was sixteen his father a pencil manufacturer had saved enough money to send him to harvard there he read a great deal and thus philosophically and literarily prepared himself to become a spokesman for the transcendentalist movement again however his career as a student was unspectacular when thoreau graduated from harvard in  he had been educated for four possible professions law the clergy business or teaching he was really interested in none of these professions for which he had been prepared but he tried teaching for a short while he was given a position in concord but soon resigned when he discovered that he was expected to teach by conscientiously beating the abcs into his students with a rod he decided that he would rather make pencils with his father and do some occasional surveying the latter activity would later come to be one of the main breadandbutter occupations of his life needless to say the townspeople were surprised that a harvard man should turn out so disappointingly this was to be the first of many ways in which thoreau would rebel against societys expectations for him yet while the townspeople were looking upon him as a loafer thoreau was then in the late s and early s mapping out his strategy to become as famous and influential a transcendentalist writer and lecturer as emerson he tried teaching again in  with his brother john and they conducted what today would still be considered a progressive school but this was only a tangential interest for him he had already decided what his primary vocation would be in  he had begun his journal the workbook to which he would practically devote his life and in which he would perfect his art until his death in  thoreau religiously worked day in and day out at this occupation of which the scoffing townspeople were ignorant to realize the intense seriousness with which he pursued it one can profitably read through his journal of  there one finds the anxiety of the struggling wouldbe master craftsman whose work does not yet meet his own standards of excellence but what does all this scribbling amount to what is now scribbled in the heat of the moment one can contemplate with somewhat of satisfaction but alas tomorrow — aye tonight — it is stale flat and unprofitable — in fine is not only its shell remains like some red parboiled lobster shell which kicked aside ever so often still stares at you in the path in short thoreau was deadly serious when he took up his pen — so serious that as was usual with thoreau he probably revised and polished the above complaint several times before he entered it in his journal during the time that thoreau and his brother were conducting their academy they went on a boat trip  that was to provide the raw material which thoreau would work into his first book a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  it was ten years between the actual river voyage and when his highly idealistic celebration of it was published during that time thoreau read wrote and worked at whatever jobs he could find he surveyed made pencils with his father and did odd jobs when he needed the money — thus leaving him plenty of time for his journal in  thoreau moved into the emerson household as the familys handyman he made much use of emersons library and a warm relationship grew between them as they daily conversed and as thoreau began to submit poems and essays to the dial the transcendentalist journal that emerson edited most of these poems and essays were later included in a week on the concord and merrimack rivers emerson came to admire thoreau so much that he allowed him to edit the entire april  issue emerson had high ambitions for his young friend and in  he arranged for thoreau to stay with his brother william emerson on staten island so that he might make contacts with new york publishers unfortunately this attempt to find publication was a failure and thoreau soon returned to concord and resumed work on his journal then in march  he initiated what was to be the most significant event of his life he borrowed an ax and began to construct a cabin on emersons land by the north shore of walden pond he moved into his cabin on july   and as walden indicates he attempted to reduce his needs to the barest essentials of life and to establish an intimate spiritual relationship with nature for thoreau living at walden pond was a noble experiment in three ways first thoreau was intent upon resisting the debilitating effects of the industrial revolution division of labor the minddulling repetition of factory work and a materialist vision of life the walden experiment allowed him to turn back the clock to the simpler agrarian way of life that was quickly disappearing in new england second by reducing his expenditures he reduced the time necessary to support himself and thus he could devote more time to the perfection of his art while at the pond he was able to write most of a week on the concord and merrimack rivers and third he and emerson had asserted that one can most easily experience the ideal or the divine through nature at walden pond thoreau was able to test continually the validity of this theory by living closely daytoday with nature thoreau left the pond in  and when emerson went to england in the fall of that year thoreau once again joined the household to look after the familys needs upon emersons return in  thoreau moved back to his parents home where he remained until his death between  and  thoreau spent his time walking through the countryside making pencils surveying and devoting himself to a new passion the composition of walden the work went through many painstaking revisions during those seven years yet when it appeared the product of those years of labor was not well received while it was not so great a failure as a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  sold  given away and while it did receive some good reviews it hardly fulfilled thoreaus dream of becoming a major spokesman for the transcendentalist movement he did not complain about the poor reception given to walden but it must have been a major psychological setback viewed today its publication marked the high point of his career and his contemporaries virtually ignored it thoreaus later years were characterized by an increased interest in the cause of abolition and the scientific study of nature in  he wrote an essay entitled herald of freedom which praised abolitionist wendell phillips and in  he published civil disobedience which also dealt with the subject of slavery in america in neither piece did thoreau protest loudly but in  his indignation began to grow when he delivered a speech entitled slavery in massachusetts he became more involved with the abolitionist movement and in  delivered his fiery plea for captain john brown wherein he praised the morality of browns violent resistance to slavery and sternly denounced the federal government for sanctioning the institution of slavery this speech was soon followed by another entitled the last days of john brown in  thoreau had advocated nonviolent passive resistance to slavery but as it became more and more a central concern of his life he gradually came to advocate armed revolt even civil war as a valid means of destroying an immoral system in his abolitionist speeches and essays thoreau revealed a turbulent sense of outrage that was one side of his personality the other side as seen when he was in the presence of nature also remained strong during his later years and as he grew weaker after his bouts with tuberculosis in  and  he turned to nature in order to regain his health — but not with the transcendentalist fervor that characterized his youth during this period of decline his journal reveals a growing interest in natural history accompanied by a more scientific less transcendental approach to nature although the latter part of his journal does contain many imaginative descriptions of nature similar to those found in walden there is an increasing number of entries like the following of  it rained hard on the twentieth and part of the following night — two and one eighth inches of rain in all there being no drought — raising the river from some two or three inches above summer level to seven and a half inches above the summer level at  am of the twentyfirst such entries have led some scholars to think that thoreau gradually decayed as a transcendentalist during the late s and early s on may   thoreau died in his parents home in concord a man of admirable spirit he passed out of the world with typical thoreauvian humor when a friend asked him if he had made amends with god thoreau quipped i did not know that we had ever quarreled when thoreau died scarcely anyone in america noticed and the few that did mourn his passing would have been surprised to learn that a century later he would be unanimously acknowledged as one of americas greatest literary artists george w curtis did not understate the matter when he wrote in thoreaus obituary that the name of henry thoreau is known to very few persons beyond those who personally knew him thoreau had fervently devoted himself to the pursuit of a literary career in the late s but after thirty years of intense effort in his art he died a failure by contemporary standards of success in his eulogy at thoreaus funeral emerson declared that the country knows not yet or in the least part how great a son it has lost and it was not until the twentieth century was well under way that thoreau came to be recognized as the genius that he was what little recognition thoreau did receive during the latter half of the nineteenth century was strongly colored by some unfortunate remarks made by emerson and james russell lowell two very influential men in matters of literary taste both men published essays on thoreau shortly after his death and virtually determined for quite some time what the publics attitude toward thoreau would be while supposedly eulogizing thoreau emerson managed to emphasize every negative trait that he had found or imagined in thoreaus personality one sees in his portrait of thoreau an almost inhuman ascetic and stoic he had no temptations to fight against — no appetites no passions no taste for elegant trifles and a somewhat cranky antisocial hermit few lives contained so many renunciations    it cost him nothing to say no indeed he found it much easier than to say yes in this eulogy emerson also strongly emphasized thoreaus abilities as a naturalist and thus established the image of thoreauthenaturelover in the worst sense of the term that was to obscure his primary significance as an artist for quite some time three years later in  james russell lowell published his essay on thoreau and reinforced emersons caricature of thoreau as a cold brittle antisocial recluse he wrote that thoreau seems to me to have been a man with so high a conceit of himself that he accepted without questioning and insisted on accepting his defects and weaknesses of character as virtues and powers peculiar to himself    his mind strikes us as cold and wintry this was a damning indictment but even more detrimental to thoreaus reputation was lowells assertion that thoreau was merely a minor emerson an imitator of his mentor in a fable for critics lowell depicted a thoreau who trod in emersons tracks with legs painfully short in addition he opened the essay on thoreau with a similar gibe among the pistillate plants kindled to fruitage by the emersonian pollen thoreau is thus far the most remarkable and it is something eminently fitting that his posthumous works should be offered us by emerson for they are strawberries from his own garden to realize the influence that lowells opinion carried in literary circles one should note that as late as  mark van doren reiterated a similar misconception in his henry david thoreau van doren wrote that thoreau is a specific emerson and that philosophically thoreaus position was almost identical with emersons to those familiar with emersons and thoreaus writings such a view of an emersonian thoreau is a gross misconception philosophically and aesthetically they were often at odds and one need only read emersons nature and thoreaus walden to note the differences in personality and most important the differences in their art yet the emersonian tag hindered the recognition of thoreaus unique greatness for over half a century as did the popular conceptions of the effete nature lover and the cranky hermit one finds for example oliver wendell holmes treating thoreau as a joke thoreau the nullifier of civilization    insisted on nibbling his asparagus at the wrong end and robert louis stevenson echoed lowell by terming thoreau dry priggish and selfish adding that it was not inappropriate surely that he had much close relations with the fish the illfounded jokes began to come to an end during the s when serious scholars began to take a closer look at the basis of thoreaus small reputation the portraits of thoreau by emerson and lowell were reexamined and most critics came to the conclusion that as charles c abbot wrote in  neither emerson nor lowell was fitted to the task they undertook emersons journals revealed a basic misunderstanding of thoreaus aims and accomplishments lowell the indoor kidglove critic was obviously out of touch with the thorny world that thoreau inhabited between the s and the midtwentieth century the old misconceptions about thoreau withered away and as critics began examining thoreau on his own ground — that is his writings — his reputation grew rapidly today his reputation as an artist is greater than emersons and ironically virtually no one except specialists in american literature reads either lowells poetry or his literary criticism as wendell glick has noted one of the most conspicuous nails in the coffin of lowells reputation is his maligning of thoreaus genius by the unanimous consent of literary critics genius is the only word
