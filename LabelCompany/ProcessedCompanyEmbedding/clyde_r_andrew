roby brock robytalkbusinessnet september    am  views  editor’s note this story appears in the latest magazine issue of talk business arkansas which you can read online at this link an el dorado boy can have a lot of fun on the backroads and highways of south arkansas and northern louisiana those roads can also offer a great education about commerce and life r andrew clyde who spent many a childhood day on those backroads is poised to lead murphy oil corporation’s new spinoff company murphy usa after years of prodding from investors murphy oil corp announced last december that it would separate its “downstream” operations – mainly its retail centers – and become a pure play oil and gas exploration and production company clyde was tapped in january to guide the new company after years of management consulting in the energy business in texas and around the world he majored in business administration and minored in geology at southern methodist university in dallas after an early stint with arthur anderson cpas he found his way into the energy industry working with a turnaround entrepreneur and consulting giant booz and co where he worked for  years at booz clyde managed to make time to earn a mba from the kellogg school of business at northwestern university in chicago he eventually headed booz’s north american energy chemicals and utilities practice which provided services to major oil and gas companies large independent firms and small box retail companies his work took him to  countries around the world and introduced him to murphy oil “i think that career absolutely prepared me for taking on this role both in terms of knowing the industry knowing the industry participants and the industry structure and dynamics” clyde said early years the year old president and ceo of murphy oil’s retail business moved to el dorado at the age of three after his father an architect relocated the family back to arkansas after several years in chicago where clyde was born the move offered clyde and his two sisters a less stressful life and made sure that there would be plenty of time spent with family and friends hunting fishing and playing golf el dorado’s public schools offered a high quality education with the nucleus of murphy oil executives in the town clyde’s grandfather robert aycock who worked and lived in the area sold fuels for panam southern throughout south arkansas and northern louisiana aycock eventually retired and set up his own commercial fuels business serving small customers in the region during summers and on winter breaks in college clyde worked for and traveled with his grandfather to call on customers giving the future business leader a real world education in “personal service ” “what visiting customers meant to him was driving him to a peach orchard near ruston going out and picking five bushels of peaches and driving through northern louisiana and south arkansas to these small tier  railroads and dropping off a bushel of peaches and having lunch with a railroad customer” clyde recalls “in the fall the only thing that changed was picking up pecans instead of peaches” for clyde those interactions provided a foundation for the energy business that he would turn into a career more importantly it planted the seeds of a more important career lesson taking care of customers “i learned a lot about the oil and gas business driving around with him and i learned a lot about customerfacing businesses watching how he interacted with his customers and how he was always there for them” said clyde “if you were a middleman – which he was and they were increasingly being phased out – he always said you have to offer something of value otherwise there’s no need for a middleman what he offered was the ability to get hold of him  he provided a level of service and responsiveness to their needs that the larger companies couldn’t” the spin clyde hopes to translate that simple premise into spectacular success with murphy usa the new company which will keep its headquarters in murphy oil’s el dorado corporate complex already has a major us footprint as of june   there were  retail outlets in  states with plans to top  by year’s end the business also owns midstream assets including product distribution terminals and pipeline positions murphy usa accounts for roughly  of murphy oil’s current revenues which topped  billion in  projections for  indicate that murphy usa will easily clear  billion in sales of fuel merchandise and other transactions about  of the company’s retail locations are  square foot kiosks that handle  million transactions daily murphy usa is experimenting with larger  square foot formats but its strength is in the smaller size many of which can be found on walmart properties across the south and midwest that “strategic and complimentary” relationship with walmart is one of five major pillars that clyde is counting on to come out of the gates fast with the new publicly traded company murphy usa has embarked on a store expansion with walmart over the next three years “when you’re sitting in front of the world’s largest retailer you’re drawing a lot of traffic” clyde says “it’s great real estate and it’s a great consumer base because they are looking for low price and great values everyday” lowcost gasoline and lowcost overhead are two more crucial components to driving shareholder value for clyde he notes that priceconscious shoppers – like the ones visiting walmart – are murphy usa’s target customers price is the overwhelming number one reason a customer chooses a gas station murphy usa’s research shows in presentations to analysts clyde highlights a slide that shows price and promotion account for  of the decisionmaking driving fuel purchases convenience is also an important factor murphy usa’s efficiency in building sites –  to  million per location – and the associated labor that comes with such an efficient operation is another crucial piece to its profitability puzzle in its smaller  square foot formats payroll may only include five employees “we think everyday about if we are doing something to add complexity to our business because we know if we add complexity we’re going to add costs” clyde said he also asserts that the company’s safety security and environmental record is “sterling” and its maturity in the fuel supply chain thanks to murphy oil’s history gives the new spinoff advantages to maintain low costs that will translate into lower prices for consumers “i think the story for investors is pretty straightforward” clyde says “we have some distinctive strength and strategies we have a strong earnings base we have growth ahead of us and we have a conservative capital structure those things make a really compelling story” next chapter on august   murphy usa shares launched trading on the new york stock exchange under the trading symbol “musa” murphy oil shareholders received one share of musa common stock for every four shares of murphy oil common stock held at the close of business on the record date of august   the company already has its management team and board of directors in place so it was open for business on its first day as a standalone firm “being prepared for day one is key” clyde stresses with murphy usa operating in many ways as an independent division within murphy oil clyde expects few if any glitches with the spinoff date being fluid he said his team hit a july  deadline to have all of the accounting finance it and human resources components in place contracts have been altered to segregate the two companies at the right time he’s hitting the road to meet with investors analysts and potential shareholders in the third quarter of  his presentation is made easier by the fact that he’s selling an existing enterprise that has been the baby of the family business “not only has the earnings been tangled up and hidden inside murphy oil corp but the story has been a little lost as well” he said “it just doesn’t get the attention on the earnings call and at the analysts’ meeting and rightly so it’s a smaller portion of the business as a standalone business it is the story” by the numbers  retail outlets in  states as of june    total revenues –  billion  billion merchandise sales  net income –  million  million transactions daily number of employees –
