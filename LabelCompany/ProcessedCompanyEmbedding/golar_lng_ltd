glancebusiness structureour strategyinnovationwhere we operateboard of directorsmanagementour history we embrace fresh thinking and our lean organisational structure enables us to develop new ideas quickly our two most significant innovations have been the world’s first fsru conversion the golar spirit – which went into operation in  the world’s first flng conversion the golar hilli – which will go into operation in  in both cases we converted an existing ship on a speculative basis conversion of an existing asset has enabled golar to offer a quickdelivering and cheap solution to an industry problem which might be a need to rapidly open up new markets for excess lng or to meet urgent requirements for new gas fired power a need to enable owners of stranded gas reserves to monetise their asset our willingness to initiate the speculative conversion of a ship into an fsru or flng demonstrated our belief in the soundness of our offering this in turn gave our first customers the confidence to transact with us we are definitely not pack animals we have demonstrated with our work with flng and fsrus that we are prepared to take leadership to date none of our competitors has successfully emulated this business model although the approach with flng is similar to an fsru conversion the cost and scale of flng represent a significant step up we therefore believe that it will be some time before we face serious competition in the flng business golar’s flng business model the rate of offshore natural gas discoveries has soared in recent years there are estimated to be at least  billion cubic feet of natural gas lying in offshore fields – of which  is estimated to be stranded “stranded gas” means gas that would not be viable to extract using established methods in use before golar’s flng solution existed locating the liquefaction process offshore on a vessel can dramatically reduce the cost per mmbtu of liquefying gas converting a vessel in a specialised shipyard where the skills and resources are already at hand and don’t need to be brought in is much quicker and cheaper than building a facility in remote parts of the world that lack the essential infrastructure necessary to get started with our flng model a megagasfield is no longer a prerequisite to monetisation it is now easier to sell small parcels of gas without flooding the market it is no longer necessary to find a large number of buyers at once golar’s flng solution is based on the conversion of a moss type lng carrier fitted with triedandtested black  veatch bv liquefaction technology and connected to a clientspecified mooring system the bv prico® process uses a single mixed refrigerant technology that is simple reliable and efficient black  veatch has developed more than  operating lng production facilities globally and most of them use this process the prico® process also has a small enough footprint that it can be mounted on a vessel the first marinemounted bv prico® process was successfully commissioned in  flng hilli episeyo  million manhours to completion  km of cabling  mw of power on board  people on board to complete conversion fsru the practice of converting lng carriers into floating storage and regasification units fsrus is now well accepted – thanks to innovation by golar we pioneered the fsru conversion concept with the golar spirit which went into operation in brazil in  we then successfully replicated the process three more times newbuild fsrus have since established themselves as a costeffective alternative to conversions for us at golar and for other market participants an fsru is an lng carrier with onboard regasification equipment it receives liquefied lng stores it and converts it into natural gas for pipelines or onshore processing and power generation fsrus have a number of advantages over landbased lng facilities they are quicker to build and less expensive they can be moved from one location to another as the business case demands they remain largely unseen by the public and are not an unsightly permanent feature of the landscape we put the first fsru into operation in each of the four areas in which we

value investors consider golar lng gmlp stock now july    am edt by zacks equity research zackscom shutterstock photo value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment after all who wouldnt want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value one way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process lets put golar lng partners lp gmlp stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for valueoriented investors right now or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks pe ratio a key metric that value investors always look at is the price to earnings ratio or pe for short this shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world the best use of the pe ratio is to compare the stocks current pe ratio with a where this ratio has been in the past b how it compares to the average for the industrysector and c how it compares to the market as a whole on this front golar lng has a trailing twelve months pe ratio of  as you can see in the chart below this level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large as the pe for the sp  stands at about  if we focus on the longterm pe trend golar lngs current pe level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past three years with the number having risen over the past few months further the stocks pe also compares favorably with the zacks classified oil and gas  refining and marketing  master limited partnerships industrys trailing twelve months pe ratio which stands at  at the very least this indicates that the stock is significantly undervalued right now compared to its peers however we should point out that golar lng has a forward pe ratio price relative to this years earnings of  so on the ground of the forward earnings estimates we might say that the companys share price is likely to appreciate in the near future ps ratio another key metric to note is the pricesales ratio this approach compares a given stocks price to its total sales where a lower reading is generally considered better some people like this metric more than other valuefocused ones because it looks at sales something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings right now golar lng has a ps ratio of about  this is marginally lower than the sp  average which comes in at  right now as we can see in the chart below this is below the highs for this stock but above its median in particular over the past few years if anything golar lng is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a ps metric which suggests that the companys stock price has already appreciated to some degree relative to its sales broad value outlook in aggregate golar lng currently has a zacks value style score of a putting it into the top  of all stocks we cover from this look this makes golar lng a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too for example the peg ratio for golar lng is  a level that is lower than the industry average of  the peg ratio is a modified pe ratio that takes into account the stocks earnings growth rate additionally its pcf ratio another great indicator of value comes in at  which is far better than the industry average of  clearly gmlp is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles what about the stock overall though golar lng might be a good choice for value investors there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name in particular it is worth noting that the company has a growth grade of c and a momentum score of f this gives gmlp a zacks vgm scoreor its overarching fundamental gradeof b you can read more about the zacks style scores here   meanwhile the companys recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best the current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower while the full year estimate has seen zero upward and four downward revisions in the same time period as a result the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by  in the past two months while the full year estimate has decreased  you can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below golar lng partners lp price and consensus golar lng partners lp price and consensus  golar lng partners lp quote this somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a zacks rank  hold and why we are looking for inline performance from the company in the near term bottom line golar lng is an inspired choice for value investors as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front however with a sluggish industry rank among the bottom  and a zacks rank  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall in fact over the past three years the zacks oil and gas  refining and marketing  master limited partnerships industry has clearly underperformed the broader market as you can see below so value investors might want to wait for estimates analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first but once that happens this stock could be a compelling pick will you make a fortune on the shift to electric cars heres another stock idea to consider much like petroleum  years ago lithium power may soon
