threestory building located in the lawrenceville neighborhood of pittsburgh pennsylvania the developer is seeking equity investments of  which will be invested for a period of    years and will be used to cover the acquisition cost of the building and to redevelop it from a single residential unit  retail space into four residential units  retail space investors will receive all cash flow until an  preferred return is met  most of the equity investment is expected to be returned when the building is refinanced at stabilization an overall internal rate of return of around  is projected over the investment period  both pittsburgh and lawrenceville are rapidly strengthening in market value and butler street is one of the leading urban retail corridors in pittsburgh the investment strategy consists of a twophase strategy to add value phase  in which the upper two floors are converted from one to four units  will be implemented immediately to better capture market demand phase  in which the underperforming retail tenant will be replaced will be implemented no later than the end of  and sooner if the retail tenant decides to leave rent is approximately  of market rate in the retail

third floors built in   butler underwent a major rehab in  and has an attractive brick façade a storefront that opens to the sidewalk and intact historic features lawrenceville is one of pittsburgh’s most soughtafter neighborhoods and butler street is a particularly vibrant retail corridor the building requires minimal alterations to maximize its potential local lore is that the property was previously configured as small efficiencies for steel workers and others in the neighborhood so the building layout allows for easy conversion back to multiple units the restaurant provides immediate inplace income and the property’s current occupancy eliminates much of the deferred maintenance and capital expenditure typically required in vacant buildings moss architects whose offices are located in lawrenceville and who have relevant  experience with buildings in the neighborhood have been selected as architect for the conversion of the upper floors sota construction services has provided preconstruction estimating for the renovation and will be among the contractors bidding the project   the upper two floors will be converted into four fullyupdated studio and onebedroom apartments studios and one bedroom units are among the most indemand units citywide and are in short supply particularly within lawrenceville  the residential unit sizes and finishes should appeal to the growing population of young professional urbanites in lawrenceville with quartz countertops subway tile stainless steel appliances refinished wood floors new or renovated bathrooms new hvac washer and dryers in each unit and views of butler street or the hills across the allegheny river rents are projected to average  per month  for each studio and  for each onebedroom and oneandahalf bathroom unit which is competitive in lawrenceville the existing lease on the retail space expires on december   with an extension option through december   rent is currently around  of current market rents the restaurant operator has invested little to no capital improvements despite the uninspiring interior finishes and lacks the traffic and online reviews that would suggest longterm viability at the same time lawrenceville is one of the most indemand locations for restaurateurs in a city that is gaining national recognition as a leading food and dining destination rent is conservatively projected at  per square foot triple net for a replacement tenant   residential uses are permitted on upper floors on butler street  in addition a code study has determined that the building should not need to be sprinklered finally zoning requires two residential parking spaces which can be accommodated in the rear yard one hurdle is that accessible parking may be required for one space if that requirement is not waived then the developer will create one larger twobedroom apartment on the top floor thereby reducing the parking requirement situated on butler street the project is in a highlywalkable and
