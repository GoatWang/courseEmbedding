discounts commissions and structuring fees we intend to use these proceeds together with the proceeds from borrowings of  million under our new term loan facility as follows  to make a cash distribution to usd group llc of  million and to reimburse usd group llc for  million of fees and expenses related to this offering  to repay  million of indebtedness under usd’s current credit facility and  to pay  million of fees and expenses in connection with our new senior secured credit agreement which will be comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan the remaining approximately  million will be retained by us for general partnership purposes including potentially to fund future acquisitions from usd and third parties and potentially for funding future growth projects such as the potential acquisition from usd group llc of the hardisty phase ii and phase iii projects on which we have been granted rights of first offer usd has not offered these assets to us and we are under no obligation to acquire these assets from usd with the proceeds of this offering or otherwise we do not presently have definitive agreements with usd or any third parties with respect to acquisitions the consummation and timing of any future acquisitions of our right of first offer assets are subject to various contingencies including usd’s successful development of such projects usd’s willingness to offer such projects for sale and obtain any necessary consents our ability to negotiate acceptable purchase agreements and commercial agreements with respect to such acquisitions and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms we may also consider the acquisition of other assets from usd and third parties any such acquisitions however will also depend on various contingencies including our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates and successfully negotiate acceptable acquisition agreements and our ability to obtain financing usd’s current credit facility bears interest at libor plus an applicable premium which equates to  as of june   an affiliate of an underwriter participating in this offering is a lender under the current usd credit facility and will receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering pursuant to the repayment of borrowings thereunder in april  our canadian subsidiary which owns our hardisty rail terminal borrowed  million under the current credit facility to fund the repayment of  million of intercompany indebtedness owed to usd the net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase additional common units approximately  million if exercised in full after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and structuring fees will be used to redeem from usd group llc a number of common units equal to the number of common units issued upon such exercise of the option at a price per unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit in this offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts commissions and the structuring fee the crude oil and hydrocarbon logistics business is highly competitive the ability to secure additional agreements for rail terminalling and railcar fleet services is primarily based on the reputation efficiency flexibility location market economies and reliability of the service provided and the pricing of services with respect to our hardisty rail terminal we believe that we will face competition from other logistics services providers such as pipelines and other rail terminalling service providers for barrels of crude oil in excess of the minimum volume commitments under our terminal services agreements with customers if our customers choose to ship excess crude oil via alternative means we may only receive the minimum volumes through our hardisty rail terminal which would cause a decrease in our revenues with respect to our san antonio and west colton rail terminals we face competition from other terminals and trucks that may be able to supply enduser markets with ethanol and other biofuels on a more competitive basis due to terminal location and price versatility and services provided both facilities are served by the union pacific up railroad in the southern california market we compete directly with burlington northern santa fe bnsf served ethanol facilities in fontana and carson as well bnsf served terminals in the san diego area a combination of rail freight and trucking economics which make up the largest share of the value chain make it very difficult to compete with other facilities in this market on terminalling throughput fees alone in the san antonio market we also compete with a bnsf served facility although our up served facility is closer to the san antonio metro area allowing advantaged trucking rates for certain enduser customers with respect to the railcar fleet services we provide we may face competition from other providers of railcars in excess of the railcars currently contracted for under our master fleet services agreements this competition may limit our ability to increase the number of railcars under contract and thus limit our ability to increase our revenues furthermore we may face competition from other parties interested in procuring railcars equipped to carry crude oil we believe however that with our strong relationships with leaders in the railcar supply industry such as cit rail union tank car company and trinity industries we will be able to continue to procure railcars on more advantageous terms with shorter lead times than our competitors we believe that generally we are favorably positioned to compete in our industry due to the strategic location of our terminals quality of service provided at our terminals independent strategy our reputation and industry relationships and the quality versatility and complementary nature of our services the competitiveness of our service offerings could be significantly impacted by the entry of new competitors into the markets in which we operate however we believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the crude oil logistics business these barriers include significant costs and execution risk a lengthy permitting and development cycle financing challenges shortage of personnel with the requisite expertise and a finite number of sites suitable for development company description we are a feebased growthoriented master limited partnership formed by us development group llc to acquire develop and operate energyrelated rail terminals and other highquality and complementary midstream infrastructure assets and businesses our initial assets consist primarily of i an origination crudebyrail terminal in hardisty alberta canada with capacity to load up to two railcar unit trains per day and ii two destination unit traincapable ethanol rail terminals in san antonio texas and west colton california with a combined capacity of approximately  barrels per day bpd our rail terminals provide critical infrastructure allowing our customers to transport energyrelated products from multiple supply regions to multiple demand markets in addition we provide railcar services through the management of a railcar fleet consisting of  railcars as of august   that are committed to customers on a longterm basis we generate substantially all of our operating cash flow by charging fixed fees for handling energyrelated products and providing related services we do not take ownership of the underlying commodities that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our customers based on the value of such commodities rail transportation of energyrelated products provides efficient and flexible access to key demand markets on a relatively low fixedcost basis and as a result has become an important part of north american midstream infrastructure the following table provides a summary of our initial assets designed capacity commodity primary terminal terminal name location bpd handled customers type producersrefiners hardisty rail terminal alberta canada   crude oil marketers origination san antonio rail terminal texas us  ethanol refinersblenders destination west colton rail terminal california us  ethanol refinersblenders destination   based on two railcar unit trains comprised of  gallon approximately  barrels railcars being loaded at  of volumetric capacity per day actual amount of crude oil loading capacity may vary based on factors including the size of the unit trains the size type and volumetric capacity of the railcars utilized and the type and specifications of crude oil loaded among other factors we generate the vast majority of our operating cash flow in connection with providing crude oil terminalling services at our hardisty rail terminal substantially all of the capacity at our hardisty rail terminal is contracted under multiyear takeorpay terminal services agreements with seven customers furthermore approximately  of the contracted utilization at our hardisty rail terminal is with subsidiaries of five investment grade companies including major integrated oil companies refiners and marketers each of the terminal services agreements with our hardisty rail terminal customers has an initial contract term of five years the initial terms of six of these agreements commenced between june   and august   and the initial term of the seventh agreement will commence on october   additionally each of these agreements is subject to inflationbased rate escalators and all but one agreement has automatic renewal provisions in addition to terminalling services we provide customers access to railcars under fleet services agreements which commit customers to railcars and fleet management services on a takeorpay basis for periods ranging from five to nine years these agreements are generally executed in conjunction with commitments to use our rail terminals for the six months ended june   and the year ended december   we had revenues of  million and  million respectively and net income loss of  million and  million respectively these figures do not include the results of operations from our hardisty rail terminal which did not commence operations until june   one of our key strengths is our relationship with our sponsor usd usd is an independent growthoriented developer builder operator and manager of energyrelated infrastructure and was among the first companies to successfully develop the hydrocarbonbyrail concept usd has developed built and operated  unit traincapable origination and destination terminals with an aggregate capacity of over  bpd ten of these terminals were subsequently divested in multiple transactions for an aggregate purchase price of over  million from january  through july  usd has loaded andor handled through its terminal network a total of over  mmbbls of crude oil and over  mmbbls of ethanol furthermore usd has a nationally recognized safety record with no reportable spills at any of its terminals since its inception usd is currently owned by energy capital partners goldman sachs and certain of usd’s management team members on september   energy capital partners made a significant investment in usd and has indicated an intention to invest over an additional  billion of equity capital in usd subject to market and other conditions over five years to support usd’s growth and expansion plans energy capital partners which together with its affiliates and affiliated funds is a private equity firm with over  billion in capital commitments that primarily invests in north america’s energy infrastructure energy capital partners has significant energy infrastructure midstream master limited partnership and financial expertise to complement its investment in us to date energy capital partners and its affiliated funds have  investment platforms with investments in the power generation electric transmission midstream and renewable sectors of the energy industry including summit midstream partners lp another public master limited partnership funds affiliated with energy capital partners have invested a significant amount of capital in summit midstream partners llc the owner of the general partner of summit midstream partners lp in order to fund in part summit’s continued development and acquisition of midstream assets at any time following september   energy capital partners has the right to compel usd to effect the total sale of energy capital partners’ interests in usd and to potentially compel usd to effect a total sale of itself pursuant to an auction process usd through usd group llc currently has several major growth projects underway including the development of strategically located destination and origination rail terminals for crude oil and other energyrelated products at the closing of this offering we will enter into an omnibus agreement with usd and usd group llc pursuant to which usd group llc will grant us a right of first offer on existing expansion projects at our hardisty rail terminal for a period of seven years after the closing of this offering usd and usd group llc will also grant us a right of first offer during this sevenyear period on any additional midstream infrastructure assets and businesses that they may develop construct or acquire we cannot assure you that usd or usd group llc will be able to develop or construct or that we will be able to acquire any other midstream infrastructure project including the hardisty phase ii or hardisty phase iii projects among other things the ability of usd or usd group llc to develop the hardisty phase ii and hardisty phase iii projects or any other project and our ability to acquire such projects will depend upon usd’s and our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing we are under no obligation to make any offer and usd and usd group llc are under no obligation to accept any offer we make with respect to any asset subject to our right of first offer including the hardisty phase ii and hardisty phase iii projects additionally the approval of energy capital partners is required for the sale of any assets by usd or its subsidiaries including us other than sales in the ordinary course of business acquisitions of securities of other entities that exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures or deviations from our approved budgets energy capital partners may make these decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders this approval would be required for the potential acquisition by us of the hardisty phase ii and hardisty phase iii projects as well as any other projects or assets that usd may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may intend to pursue jointly or independently from usd energy capital partners is under no obligation to approve any such transaction if we are unable to acquire the hardisty phase ii or hardisty phase iii projects from usd group llc these expansions may compete directly with our hardisty rail terminal for future throughput volumes which may impact our ability to enter into new terminal services agreements following the termination of our existing agreements or the terms thereof and our ability to compete for future spot volumes furthermore cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons may cause usd or us to reevaluate any future expansion projects including the hardisty phase ii and hardisty phase iii projects we believe usd intends for us to be its primary growth vehicle in north america we intend to strategically expand our business by acquiring energyrelated rail terminals and other highquality and complementary midstream infrastructure assets and businesses from both usd and third parties we also intend to grow organically by opportunistically pursuing growth projects and enhancing the profitability of our assets we believe that usd’s successful project development and operating history safety track record and industry relationships will allow us to
