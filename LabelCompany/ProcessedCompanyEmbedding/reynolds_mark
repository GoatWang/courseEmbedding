cv view case cited cases reynolds consumer products inc plaintiff v handifoil corporation defendant united states district court ed virginia alexandria division july   memorandum opinion liam ogrady district judge following a four day trial a jury found the defendant liable of willfully infringing on the plaintiffs trade dress rights in violation of the lanham act the jury found in favor of the defendant on all other counts the parties have filed numerous posttrial motions the defendants primary request is that the court set aside the verdict the plaintiff requests the court enforce the jurys verdict by way of permanent injunction and award it its costs and fees for the reasons set forth below the court upholds the jurys verdict and grants an injunction in the plaintiffs favor the court also grants the plaintiffs motion for costs but denies its request for attorneys fees background this dispute began on february   when the plaintiff reynolds consumer products inc reynlods sued the defendant handifoil corporation handifoil each party manufactures markets and sells aluminum roll foil reynolds version of this product reynolds wrap has been the leading brand in the field for decades in  handifoil launched a line of roll foil products bearing the handifoil name and claiming to be new to the market this matter arises from reynolds allegation that the packaging of this handifoil product infringed and diluted the famous and distinctive reynolds wrap trade dress reynolds twice moved to amend its complaint each time the motion was granted on august   reynolds filed its second amended complaint which became the operative complaint for the litigation all told reynolds raised eight causes of action against handifoil based on the marketing of the handifoil roll foil product in its answer handifoil asserted two counterclaims the first sought a cancellation of reynolds trademark registrations and the second sought a declaratory judgment of noninfringement the parties filed extensive pretrial motions including crossmotions for partial summary judgment at the time the parties fervently debated whether or not reynolds had abandoned its pertinent trade mark registrations in a memorandum opinion dated february   the court granted reynolds motion for partial summary judgment thus dismissing handifoils abandonment counterclaim the court also denied handifoils corresponding motion for partial summary judgment and its motion to strike reynolds jury demand on march   the court held argument on multiple evidentiary motions upon ruling on those motions the court invited the parties to contact a magistrate judge to further mediate their dispute the court also invited the parties to consider voluntarily waiving the jury and conducting a bench trial instead both invitations were refused with the parties having agreed to dismiss reynolds seventh cause of action unjust enrichment as well as handifoils declaratory judgment counterclaim the seven remaining counts of reynolds complaint were left to be tried by jury the jury trial began on march   four days later the jury unanimously found that handifoil had willfully infringed on reynolds federal trade dress rights count  the jury found in favor of handifoil on the remaining counts and awarded no damages the parties submitted posttrial motions on april   pursuant to their agreed upon posttrial briefing schedule handifoil submitted i a motion for judgment as a matter of law and costs or in the alternative a motion for new trial and ii a motion to bar reynolds from seeking relief under the doctrine of laches reynolds filed i a request for a permanent injunction and ii a motion for costs and attorneys fees all four motions were fully briefed and the court heard oral argument on them in open court on june   discussion i handifoils posttrial motions handifoil requests the court enter judgment as a matter of law in its favor on count  or in the alternative order a new trial additionally handifoil argues that its affirmative defense of laches should bar reynolds from obtaining any relief on count  a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule  handifoil appropriately moved for judgment as a matter of law before the case was submitted to the jury handifoil now renews its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to fed r civ p b such a motion should be granted if a district court determines without weighing the evidence or considering the credibility of the witnesses that substantial evidence does not support the jurys findings konkel v bob evans farms inc  fd   th cir  citing white v county of newberry  fd   th cir  in considering handifoils rule b motion the court views all the trial evidence in the light most favorable to reynolds and draws all reasonable inferences in its favor id citing austin v torrington co  fd   th cir  handifoil first claims it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law due to the supreme courts recent opinion in lexmark international inc v static control components inc  sct   handifoil asserts that under lexmark reynolds cannot prevail on its trade dress infringement claim because it did not produce substantial evidence of harm during trial putting aside the contention that reynolds failed to demonstrate harm handifoils argument fails because lexmark is totally inapplicable to the issue of whether the jurys finding of trade dress infringement was appropriate in lexmark the supreme court granted certiorari to decide the appropriate analytical framework for determining a partys standing to maintain an action for false advertising under the lanham act  s ct at  emphasis added internal citations omitted a unanimous supreme court answered this question by holding that to invoke the lanham acts cause of action for false advertising a plaintiff must plead and ultimately prove an injury to a commercial interest in sales or business reputation proximately caused by the defendants misrepresentations id at  emphasis added neither the court nor handifoil has ever questioned reynolds standing to bring its various lanham act claims moreover the jurys false advertising verdict in handifoils favor is not being challenged consequently handifoils attempt to broaden the ruling in lexmark — which applies specifically to standing in false advertising claims — to the issue of whether reynolds provided substantial evidence to support the jurys finding of trade dress infringement is entirely unavailing as an alternative basis for its rule b motion handifoil asserts it was unreasonable for the jury to find that handifoils packages create a likelihood of confusion with reynolds trade dress under wellsettled fourth circuit precedent the court instructed the jury that it should consider nine factors in determining whether there was a likelihood of confusion  the strength or distinctiveness of reynolds mark as actually used in marketplace  the similarity of the two marks to consumers  the similarity of the goods or services that the marks identify  the similarity of the facilities used by the markholders  the similarity of advertising used by the markholders  the defendants intent  actual confusion  the quality of the defendants product and  the sophistication of the consuming public see trial tr vol   apr   hereinafter tr see also swatch ag v beehive wholesale llc  fd   th cir  citing george  co v imagination entmt ltd  fd   th cir  after reviewing the nine factors listed above the court instructed the jury that the weight to be given each of these factors is up to you to determine no particular factor or number of factors is required to prove likelihood of confusion see tr at  this clarifying instruction is also firmly supported by fourth circuit law see swatch ag  fd at  these nine factors serve as a guide rather than a rigid formula for infringement they are not all of equal importance and not all factors are relevant in every case citing george  co  fd at  in handifoils view the packages in question are indisputably dissimilar and there was no evidence of actual consumer confusion in its memorandum in support of its motion for judgment as a matter of law handifoil states that where the marks at issue are dissimilar and there is no evidence of actual confusion extrinsic factors such as the strength of the plaintiffs mark and the similarity of the products sales outlets and advertising are insufficient to create a likelihood of confusion see dkt no  at  handifoil maintains that this alleged absence of the second and seventh factors alone requires setting aside the jurys verdict in support of this farreaching proposition handifoil first turns to anheuserbusch inc v ll wings inc  fd   th cir  rather than back this claim anheuserbusch directly contradicts handifoils contention there the fourth circuit reversed a grant of judgment as a matter of law and affirmed a jury verdict in so doing the fourth circuit noted that the pivotal issue of likelihood of confusion is particularly amendable to resolution by a jury anheuserbusch  fd at  likelihood of confusion is frequently a fairly disputed issue of fact on which reasonable minds may differ citing warner bros inc v american broad cos  fd   d cir  additionally the anheuserbusch court noted the likelihood of confusion factors are not meant to be a rigid formula for infringement but are merely a catalog of various considerations that may be relevant in determining the ultimate statutory question of likelihood of confusion id at  internal citations omitted in its reply memorandum in support of its motion for judgment as a matter of law handifoil backtracks slightly stating that while the fourth circuit considers nine factors to determine if the defendants use creates a likelihood of confusion it weighs two with particular importance — similarity of the marks and actual confusion see dkt no  at  even then however handifoil maintains that nothing reynolds cites    cures its failure to provide substantial evidence on those two factors id to support this slightly less absolute focus on two factors alone handifoil turns to swatch ag in that case the fourth circuit did note that absence of any evidence of actual confusion over a substantial period of time creates a strong inference that there is no likelihood of confusion swatch ag  fd at  citing carefirst of maryland inc v first care pc  fd   th cir  as this citation itself suggests actual confusion may be less important if the packages in question have not been on the market for a substantial period of time moreover in swatch ag the fourth circuit continued to maintain that the factors are weighed differently depending on the circumstances of the cases id stepping away from handifoils focus on actual confusion and turning instead to the likelihood of confusion test as accurately represented to the jury it cannot be said that the verdict was unsupported by substantial evidence while the parties individual experts unsurprisingly reached opposing views as to actual confusion reynolds presented evidence supporting all of the other relevant likelihood of confusion factors for example reynolds provided overwhelming evidence of the strength and distinctiveness of its trade dress similarity of the two packages similarity of the goods identified similarity of the facilities used similarity in advertising and perhaps most significantly handifoils intent taken together this evidence supported the jurys finding that certain handifoil packages would likely cause confusion with the reynolds wrap trade dress b motion for new trial under rule  in the alternative handifoil requests the court order a new trial pursuant to fed r civ p  under rule  the court may weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of witnesses and set the verdict aside if it finds the verdict to be against the clear weight of evidence see poynter by poynter v ratcliff  fd   th cir  this inquiry differs from the rule  inquiry above in that the court may order a new trial even if the jurys verdict is supported by substantial evidence id handifoil incorporates all of its arguments from its rule b motion into its request for a new trial under rule  additionally handifoil argues the jurys verdict must be set aside because reynolds expert sarah butler was not credible the court addressed why most of these argument fail during its discussion of handifoils rule b motion as for the testimony of sarah butler the court were so compelled ms butlers testimony would only weigh against reynolds on the actual confusion factor as noted above the evidence regarding the other relevant likelihood of confusion factors clearly weighed in reynolds favor c motion for new trial due to inconsistent verdict handifoils final attempt to set aside the verdict rests on an argument that the jurys decision is inconsistent and cannot be reconciled to show this inconsistency handifoil points to the jury instructions the courts summary judgment order and the relationship between trademark and trade dress rights before turning to these arguments the court first addressed reynolds argument that handifoil has waived its right to a new trial because handifoil failed to properly object to the verdict before the jury was dismissed i waiver after the verdict was read handifoils lawyer did not make a formal request for a new trial he merely pointed out an alleged inconsistency in the jurys verdict to the court the court then advised him to address the matter in posttrial briefing which handifoil had done rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure mandates that when the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is also inconsistent with the general verdict judgment must not be entered instead the court must direct the jury to further consider its answers and verdict or must order a new trial the fourth circuit has interpreted this rule as imposing an obligation upon trial counsel to object to any asserted inconsistencies in the response to jury interrogatories prior to the discharge of the jury see white v celotex corp  fd   th cir  citing fernandez v chardon  fd   st cir  merchant v ruhle  fd   st cir  a failure to bring any purported inconsistencies in the jurys verdict to the attention of the court prior to release of the jury will constitute a waiver of a partys right to seek a new trial id reynolds argues that handifoils actions constitute a waiver under the rule from white this argument fails another fourth circuit case applying the rule in white is highly instructive in essex v prince georges county the fourth circuit found no waiver in circumstances similar to those here  fed appx   n  th cir  there like here an attorney notified the district court of a potential inconsistency in the jurys verdict but was instructed to address the issue in posttrial motions and the jury was then released see id relying in part on white the fourth circuit noted the party claiming waiver had cited no authority and we can discover none for the proposition that a party who timely objects to an inconsistent verdict but does not request the proper relief waives his or her right to a new trial id the essex court went on to find that in any event under the circumstances of this case we conclude that the party seeking to set aside the verdict fairly preserved the issue of the inconsistency of the verdict id as essex demonstrates handifoil did not waive its right to a new trial under the rule in white ii legal standard having decided that handifoil did not waive its right to a new trial the court now turns to handifoils argument that the jurys verdict must be set aside because it is inconsistent the standard for setting aside an allegedly inconsistent jury verdict is a high one if there is a view of the jurys verdict which makes it consistent it must be resolved that way see city of richmond v madison mgmt grp inc  fd   th cir  citing a  g stevedores v ellerman lines ltd  us    the court is not to seek out a potential view of the case which makes the jurys finding inconsistent since such an approach results in a collision with the seventh amendment id put differently the court is required to determine whether the verdict can be sustained on any reasonable theory see vigilant ins co of new york v mckenneys inc  f appx   th cir  citing atlas food sys  servs inc v crane natl vendors inc  fd   th cir  given these standards the court must decide if there is any reasonable theory that can reconcile the jurys finding in favor of reynolds on count  trade dress infringement with its findings in favor of handifoil on counts  trademark infringement  state law trademark infringement and  common law unfair competition iii trademark vs trade dress infringement the crux of handifoils inconsistency argument is that reynolds registered trademarks provide broader rights than the reynolds wrap common law trade dress under this theory reynolds trade dress claim must be subsumed within its trademark claim thus making it impossible for a jury to find trade dress infringement but not trademark infringement reynolds argues the opposite stating that its trade dress rights are broader than those accompanying its registered marks clarifying this dispute is a necessary part of the courts review so too is an understanding of the specific facts of this case and how those facts were presented to the jury the jurys verdict is reconcilable when all of these elements are first clarified individually and then reviewed together in the proper context the lanham act defines a trademark as any word name symbol or device or any combination thereof   used by a person   to identify and distinguish the services of one person including a unique service from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services even if that source is unknown see  usc §  see also two pesos inc v taco cabana inc  us    a products trade dress on the other hand is essentially its total image and overall appearance see two pesos  us at  n  citations omitted trade dress thus deals with the total image of a product and may include features such as size shape color or color combinations texture graphics or even particular sales techniques id see also  j thomas mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition §  th ed  hereinafter  j mccarthy both a companys registered trademarks and its common law trade dress are protected from infringement under the lanham act see  usc §§   trademark infringement focuses on one aspect of a products image ie the trademark see m kramer mfg  fd at  n  trade dress infringement differs in that it focuses on the total image of plaintiffs product package and advertising and compares this with the defendants image id citing  j mccarthy at §  the court appropriately in its view instructed the jury on the differences between trademark and trade dress as follows a trademark is a word symbol or combination of words or symbols used by a person to identify his product to distinguish his product from those manufactured or sold even if that source is generally unknown    the term trade dress refers to the total image and overall appearance of a product product packaging product label product design or a combination of these things it includes features such as size shape color or color combinations texture graphics or particular sales techniques see tr at  before addressing the issue of whether reynolds trade dress infringement claim is subsumed by its trademark infringement claim or viceversa it is important to analyze how reynolds chose to present these various rights reynolds trademark registrations are as follows reg reg date mark image reynolds  august   wrap package design reynolds  june   wrap package design with name see plf second amend complaint dkt no  at ¶  the drawing for reynolds trademark no  hereinafter the  mark is lined to designate the colors blue horizontal silver diagonal and pink vertical id the drawing for reynolds trademark no  hereinafter the  mark repeats the color scheme from the  mark and merely adds the words reynolds wrap on the drawing id combined these two registered marks protect the reynolds wrap color scheme and brand name additionally in its operative complaint reynolds claimed to own extensive common law trade dress rights in the overall look feel and commercial impression of its reynolds wrap packaging design id at ¶  reynolds identified at least twelve elements that make up this common law trade dress a the color scheme b the use of the color scheme c the use of prominent lettering within the blue section d the use of silver bands to separate the blue and pink sections e the placement of the quantity information f the inclusion of the make in the usa lettering g the repetition of the color scheme and type on the ends of the boxes h the press here to lock feature at the ends of the boxes i the use of graphics with howto information j the lift graphic k the positioning of the brand name on the top flap of the box and l the color yellow placement and text used to caution the consumer id with reynolds own descriptions of its trademark and trade dress in mind it is far easier to dissect the parties competing claims over which provides broader rights and more importantly to analyze handifoils claim that there was no rational basis for the jury to find trade dress infringement but not trademark infringement the first point of confusion which can be quickly clarified stems from professor mccarthys comment that distinctions between trademarks and trade dress have largely disappeared see  j mccarthy at §  isolated on its own this observation bolsters handifoils irreconcilability argument in the very next sentence of his treatise however professor mccarthy goes on to say today many types of designations protecatable as trade dress are also registerable as trademarks id this accurate description of the law only notes that what makes up a products trade dress can hypothetically just as easily be registered as a trademark applied to the facts of this case the following should therefore be obvious although reynolds could have likely obtained a registered trademark that is identical in all respects to its trade dress it chose not to additionally as reynolds own nonexhaustive listing of its trade dress elements demonstrates the marks reynolds has chosen to register are different than its unregistered trade dress this is all to say that in the context of this case trademarks are not the same as trade dress on its face this premise does little to reconcile the parties competing arguments about whether trademarks or trade dress provide broader rights again the facts — which include the reality that reynolds wrap trade dress is different than the registered marks — are central reynolds points to two pesos for the proposition that the lanham acts trade dress infringement provision prohibits a broader range of practices that it does for trademark infringement the text pointed to in two pesos merely notes that the general lanham act principles qualifying a mark for registration    are for the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection  us at  as handifoil correctly notes the entire quotation from two pesos — not to mention the issue actually addressed in that case — does little to support reynolds argument and is mostly irrelevant professor mccarthy has advised that the irony of both patent claims and definitions of trade dress is that the more elements that are listed the narrower and weaker the claim see  j mccarthy at §  to bolster its argument handifoil focuses on this statement and the fact that reynolds trade dress includes at least twelve elements while its registered marks contain significantly less the court does not doubt the accuracy of professor mccarthys observation unfortunately for handifoil this statement does not mandate the conclusion handifoil suggests professor mccarthy only notes that trade dress with more elements will generally be weaker than trade dress with fewer elements even if this proposition was transferred to an argument that a trade dress with more elements is generally weaker than a trademark with fewer elements — a suggestion the court offers no opinion on — such a theoretical deduction cannot be divorced from the facts of this case as presented to the jury for reynolds trademark infringement claims counts  and  the jury was told that reynolds received two registrations for the trademarks depicting certain elements of the reynolds wrap package design see tr at  as reynolds registered marks show those certain elements are only the color scheme and the words reynolds wrap as already described in greater detail above the jury was also appropriately instructed that reynolds trade dress refers to the total image and overall appearance of a product id at  the jury therefore had two inquiries to keep in mind when comparing the reynolds and handifoil boxes  for the purposes of trademark infringement are the handifoil boxes likely to cause confusion with the certain elements making up reynolds registered marks and  for the purposes of trade dress infringement are the handifoil boxes likely to cause confusion with the total image and overall appearance of the reynolds wrap boxes the jury answered the first inquiry in the negative and the second in the affirmative while this may not have been the most reasonable verdict it was not an unreasonable one a picture is worth a thousand words moving away from the theoretical arguments above to the actual boxes presented at trial provides further context for the jurys verdict consider the two following sets of boxes example no  reynolds wrap box corresponding allegedlyinfringing handifoil box example no  reynolds wrap box corresponding allegedlyinfringing handifoil box the jury easily could have looked at the boxes and decided the difference between the words handfoil and reynolds wrap on each box were enough to find no infringement between the handifoil boxes and the  mark which includes the words reynolds wrap as for the  mark which focuses on the color scheme the jury could have also determined that the handifoil boxes did not infringe on certain elements of reynolds trademark for example the jury could have noticed that each reynolds box above has three curved silver lines separting the blue from the pinkish areas in example no  and the yellow area in example no  the jury could easily have also noticed that on the handifoil boxes the blue area is directly next to the pink and yellow areas this would have been a reasonable theory and there are surely others that would have been just as reasonable as well turning to trade dress the similarity between the overall impressions of the two boxes in each set is striking this is case even if the boxes color schemes are put aside take example no  in this set the two boxes both say nonstick and heavy duty the reynolds box says foods lift right off and the handifoil box say food easily lifts off both boxes place the identical square footage on the right end of the box with the metric conversions typed neatly below additionally the twodimensional images above cannot capture the similarity of the boxes side and end panels all of which bear striking semablance add to these characteristics the made in usa language on the right portion of the boxes in example no  — not to mention the other likelihood of confusion factors including the overwhelming evidence of handifoil intent to mimic the reynolds wrap box — and the reasonableness of the jurys trade dress verdict becomes obvious in fact any other finding may well have been unreasonable iv the jury instructions handifoil notes that even if the trademark and trade dress rights are different the jury was instructed to apply the same likelihood of confusion test to each in handifoils view this also renders the verdict irreconcilable handifoil correctly points out that the court instructed the jury to use the same likelihood of confusion test for analyzing counts    and  of reynolds complaint without repeating he extensive discussion above the court is confident that the jury applied the likelihood of confusion test in the context of two different inquiries trademark and trade dress infringement it was therefore rational for the jury to reach one finding on the likelihood of confusion test regarding reynolds discrete registered marks and an opposite finding on the same test regarding the overall trade dress of reynolds wrap it is perhaps more difficult to square the jurys finding of likelihood of confusion for trade dress with its finding that handifoil is not guilty of common law unfair competition count  see eg  j mccarthy at §  if defendants trade dress is likely to cause confusion with plaintiffs trade dress then a finding of unfair competition is warranted this decision may be attributable to nothing more than the jurys misunderstanding of the instructions such misunderstandings do not require a new trial see city of richmond  fd at  a jury verdict inconsistent on its face does not require a new trial if the inconsistency may reasonably be attributed to the jurys misunderstanding of the jury instructions citing silverberg v paine webber jackson  curtis inc  fd   n  th cir  the only instruction provided to the jury for reynolds unfair competition claim court  stated that virginia common law unfair competition claim requires the same proof including likelihood of confusion as the lanham act offenses see tr at  reasonable jurors could look at this instruction and determine that a finding of noninfringement on any of the lanham act claims requires a finding in handifoils favor on the unfair competition count such a view is not necessarily irrational nor does it render the jurys careful deliberations inconsistent city of richmond  fd at  n  as far as irreconcilability is concerned our inquiry ends when after viewing all surrounding circumstances we conclude that the jurys verdict is consistent v the courts summary judgment memorandum opinion finally handifoil claims that if the jurys verdict can be reconciled then it cannot be squared with the courts february   memorandum opinion resolving the parties crossmotinos for partial summary judgment see dkt no  in its summary judgment motion handifoil argued that reynolds had abandoned its registered marks this question forced the court to decide whether the reynolds wrap boxes used in commerce create the same continuing commerical impression as the  and  marks id at  applying the fourth circuit standard for abandonment set out in george  co  fd at  in deciding the abandonment issue the court held that as a matter of law the specimen reynolds provided to the united states patent and trademark office uspto created the same continuing commercial impression as its current box id at  handifoil relies on this language to show that the jury could not have rationally seen a substantive difference between reynolds trade dress and the registered marks alternatively handifoil requests the court reverse its position and find that reynolds has abandoned its marks this argument fails for a number of reasons paramount among them is that in its february memorandum opinion on abandonment the court compared different items under a different standard than what the jury compared at the close of trial in its decision the court compared the reynolds  uspto specimen with the reynolds wrap box as currently sold under the standard for tacking which is a question of law at the close of trial the jury was asked to make an entirely factual determination by comparing a variety of handifoil boxes to other reynolds wrap boxes as well as reynoldss registered marks handifoils reliance on the courts february memorandum opinion is therefore misplaced d affirmative defense of laches having denied handifoils motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial the court turns to handifoils affirmative defense of estoppel by laches for the doctrine to bar reynolds from obtaining relief handifoil bears the burden of proving that  reynolds knew of handifoils infringing use  reynolds delay in challenging the infringement was unreasonable and  handifoil has been unduly prejudiced by reynolds delay see sara lee corp v kayerroth corp  fd   n  th cir  citing brittingham v jenkins  fd   th cir  see also eeoc v navy fed credit union  fd   th cir  because the court finds that reynolds delay was not unreasonable handifoils laches defense fails handifoil claims reynolds failed to act reasonably by waiting ten months between allegedly gaining knowledge of the infringing handifoil boxes and bringing suit several principles bear on the issue of whether this delay was unreasonable first and in this case determinatively the fourth circuit has noted that estoppel by laches may not be invoked to deny injunctive relief if it is apparent that the infringing use is likely to cause confusion sara lee  fd at  citing  mccarthy at §  univ of pittsburgh v champion prod inc  fd   d cir  see also lyons pship lp v morris costumes inc  fd   th cir  a prospective injunction is entered only on the basis of current ongoing conduct that threatens future harm inherently such conduct cannot be so remote in time as to justify the application of the doctrine of laches citations omitted given the jurys finding of willful trade dress infringement and the courts granting of an injunction in reynolds favor in light of that finding estoppel by laches is inappropriate see rothman v greyhound corp  fd   th cir  it is settled that mere delay in seeking relief is no bar to an injunction when the infringer has had knowledge of the fact that he is infringing and has deliberately set out to capitalize on the good will of the owner citing menendez v holt  us    in determining whether reynolds delay was unreasonable the court is also guided by the limitations period it would borrow from actions at law in virginia see eg lyons  fd at  citing sara lee  fd at  in this case the analogous statute of limitations period is two years see eg teaching co ltd pship v unapix entmt inc  fsuppd   ed va  citing unlimited screw prods inc v malm  fsupp   ed va  that reynolds ten month delay fits comfortably within this two year statute of limitations is further evidence that the delay was reasonable the court is also mindful of the dilemma sometimes faced by plaintiffs in reynolds position if reynolds had filed its claims earlier it may have been even more difficult for it to prove damages or reputational harm see sara lee corp  fd at  if the trademark owner rushes immediately into litigation it may have little or no evidence of actual confusion and real commercial damage    and may even face a counterclaim for overly aggressive use of litigation citing  mccarthy § c therefore reynolds had no obligation to sue until the likelihood of confusion loomed large see id ii reynolds request for a permanent injunction given the jurys finding of willful trade dress infringement reynolds seeks a permanent injunction pursuant to section  of the lanham act this section vests the court with the power to grant injunctions according to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court may deem reasonable to prevent a violation of the acts trade dress infringement provision see  usc § a traditionally such injunctive relief has been the preferred remedy to insure sic that future violations will not occur see lone star  fd at  citation omitted the supreme court however has warned against any categorical grants or denials of such relief see ebay inc v mercexchange llc  us    instead for the court to grant an injunction reynolds must show that  it has suffered irreparable harm  its remedies at law are inadequate  the balance of the hardships favors reynolds and  the public interest would not be disserved by the injunction see pbm prods llm v mead johnson  co  fd   th cir  citing ebay  us at  reynolds has made this showing prior to the supreme courts ruling in ebay the fourth circuit held that a finding of irreparable injury ordinarily follows when a likelihood of confusion or possible risk to reputation appears see lone star  fd at  citations omitted while under ebay a finding of irreparable harm on its own does not automatically trigger injunctive relief this court has continued to find that irreparable harm is generally applied once the plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of confusion the key element of an infringement case see eg diamonds direct usa inc v bfj holdings inc  fsuppd   ed va  citing scotts v united indus corp  fd   th cir  citing eli lily  co natural answers inc  fd   th cir  genesee brewing co v stroh brewing co  fd   d cir  see also lorillard tobacco co v s  m brands inc  fsuppd   ed va  also citing scotts and genesee brewing handifoil argues that reynolds failure to show actual harm in the form of actual consumer confusion or monetary damages is fatal to its request for an injunction this argument misapplies the relevant standards the jury found that handifoil willfully infringed on reynolds trade dress rights this verdict required the jury to find that handifoil had created a likelihood of confusion this likelihood of confusion primarily represents an injury to reputation see lone star  fd at  citing commcs satellite corp v comcet inc  fd   th cir  quoting yale elec corp v robertson  fd   d cir  consequently infringement gives rise to irreparable injury in that plaintiff has lost control of its business reputation    and there is an inherent injury to the good will and reputation of the plaintiff id the jury thus found that reynolds suffered irreparable harm and in this case that ongoing injury must be cured by way of an injunction importantly handifoil does not claim that reynold remedies at law are adequate nor could it it is true the jury found reynolds failed to prove that handifoil earned profits from the infringing products reynolds provided evidence regarding potential lost market share but also failed to substantially demonstrare any lost profits despite this the jurys findings of likelihood of confusion demonstrates a palpable risk of continuing and future harm this is the exact type of harm meant to be remedied by injunctive relief see teaching co  f supp d at  denial of an injunction forces the plaintiff to suffer continued infringement and to bring successive suits    citing foxtrap inc v foxtrap inc  fd   dc cir  handifoil argues that equitable balancing should also defeat reynolds request for injunctive relief in support of this position handifoil first incorporates its estoppel by laches argument that argument is rejected for the reasons discussed above second handifoil asserts the doctrine of unclean hands this equitable position also fails handifoils defense of unclean hands is based on the allegation that representatives of reynolds stole a handifoil trade show box that was not being used in commerce in order to avail itself of the unclean hands doctrine handifoil must demonstrate that it was injured by reynolds conduct see lawler v gilliam  fd   th cir  reynolds agreed to drop its claims related to this trade show box as soon as it was notified that the box was not used in commerce accordingly without determining whether reynolds did not fact act unfairly it is clear handifoil was not injured by any such activity finally the public interest would benefit from an injunction handifoils specific intent to mimic the reynolds wrap trade dress was made evident at trial it is therefore not surprising that the jury found handifoils trade dress infringement was willful this finding also indicates the jurys belief that future consumers may be misled an injunction would serve the public interest by mitigating this future risk see lone star  fd at  aan injunction in this case would serve the public interest by preventing future consumers from being misled citing amp inc  fd at  commcns satellite corp  fd at  having found that a permanent injunction is appropriate for the purposes of this opinion the court will refrain from immediately specifying the scope of such an injunction the court has invited the parties to meet in order to reach an agreement on the appropriate scope of this relief if the parties fail to reach such an agreement within a reasonable timeframe the court will issue a subsequent order articulating the scope of the injunction iii costs  attorneys fees each party has moved for costs pursuant to the federal rules of civil procedure under fed r civ p d costs should be allowed to the prevailing party as the rule makes clear the decision to award costs lies within the courts discretion see marx v gen revenue corp  sct    the word should makes clear that the decision whether to award costs ultimately lies within the sound discretion of the district court citing taniguchi v kan pacific saipan ltd  sct    this discretion however can be displaced by federal statute see fed r civ p d in their crossmotions for costs each party claims to be the prevailing party under rule  the jurys verdict was split and the parties unsurprisingly agree that neither had to succeed on every individual count in order to be the prevailing party the fourth circuit has defined a prevailing party as the one who succeeds on any significant issue and thereby achieves some of the benefit he sought in commencing the litigating see abernathy v clarke  fd   th cir  citing hensley v eckerhart  us    under the jurys split decision each party can claim to have succeeded on a significant issue in the case but by obtaining a permanent injunction only reynolds achieved some of the benefit if sought in commencing the litigation any question as to which party prevailed can be laid to rest by handifoils exhaustive requests that the jurys verdict be set aside accordingly the court finds that reynolds is the prevailing party and is entitled to its reasonable costs in addition to its casts reynolds has moved to collect attorneys fees  usc §  allows the court to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in exceptional cases the supreme court recently clarified what constitutes such as exceptional case see octane fitness llc v icon health  fitness inc  sct    under this clarification a case is exceptional when it stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of the partys litigating position    or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated id whether or not a case is deemed exceptional is a matter left to the courts discretion id in view of this standard this case cannot be deemed exceptional accordingly the court rejects reynolds requests for attorneys fees conclusion for the reasons set forth above and for good cause shown the clerk shall enter judgment in accordance with the jurys verdict in favor of reynolds on count  trade dress infringement the court also grants a permanent injunction in reynolds favor the scope of which will be determined at a future date reynolds shall be entitled to collect its reasonable costs but no further damages or fees footnotes  the eight counts brought by reynolds were federal trademark infringement in violation of §  of the lanham act count i federal false designation of origin in violation of § a of the lanham act count  federal trade dress infringement in violation of § a of the lanham act count  common law unfair competition count  unjust enrichment count  and federal false advertising and unfair competition count   the court is aware that in some cases actual confusion provides the most compelling evidence of likelihood of confusion see lone star steakhouse  saloon v alpha of virginia inc  fd  th cir  citing m kramer mfg co inc v andrews  fd   n th cir  amp inc v foy  fd   n  th cir  hmh publishing co v brincat  fd   th cir  yet handifoils attempt to twist this standard such that the potential absence of actual confusion mandates a finding of noninfringement misreads precedent and is an exercise in faulty logic under handifoils view in all cases likelihood of confusion would be determined merely by looking at actual confusion first and similarity second thus eliminating seven or eight of the nine factors the court rejects handifoils invitation to take such a significant departure from fourth circuit law  reynolds submitted evidence showing multiple years in which reynolds wrap aluminum foil ranked at the top of equitrends overall brand equity benchmark which measures the familiarity quality purchase intent brand expectations and distinctiveness of a number of wellknown products see dkt  ex  plfs tr exs  and   evidence supporting the similarities between the handifoil and reynolds wrap packages is described in more detail below in the courts discussion on handifoils rule  motion  both packages are used to identify aluminium roll foil product  both products are sold at large consumer grocery stores  while handifoil does not advertise to individual aluminum roll foil consumers almost the entirety of the marketing pitch for the handifoil roll foil centered on the product being comparable to reynolds wrap  reynolds produced emails between handifoil and its package manufacturer where the parties articulated their specific intent to make the handifoil aluminum roll foil box resemble reynolds wrap see eg dkt  ex  plf tr ex   reynolds alleged that handifoil had four infringing boxes and the jury found that the four handifoil boxes in question did infringe on reynolds trade dress rights count  but not on its trademark rights count  the courts analysis of the two sets of boxes above can easily be expanded to cover all of the boxes considered by the jury  pointing to the jurys finding in its favor on reynoldss false advertising claim handifoil also argues that reynols has failed to show irreparable harm because the jury found that handifoil roll foil is of the same quality as reynolds wrap this arguments is unavailing even assuming the jurys verdict on count  demonstrates the jurys belief that handifoil is comparable to reynolds wrap this alone does not negate any reputational harm suffered by reynolds due to handifoils infringement furthermore the quality of goods is irrelevant to any infringement claim see eg am petroleum inst v cooper  fd   th cir  citing shell oil co v commercial petroleum inc  fd   th cir   given the jurys finding of willful trade dress infringement section a also allows reynolds to recover any damages sustained as well as handifoils profits the jury however found that reynolds failed to prove handifoil earned profits from the infringing products additionally reynolds failed to adequately prove it suffered monetary damages consequently the court limits

their discontinued ouzo pro fork is the best selling best loved fullcarbon fork ever manufactured and given their command of carbon it was only a small step for reynolds to enter the world of proquality carbon wheelset production the roots of their wheelsets trace back to the legendary company lew composites like many of companies owned by innovative types lew had spectacular ideas but simply couldnt manage to get the ball rolling on production so in early  maclean quality composites mqc purchased lews assets and intellectual property and hired their two top engineers mqc produced carbon fiber tubing for many of the industrys leading frame manufacturers in addition to aftermarket and originalequipment products in the aerospace automotive industrial and sports industries which made their partnership with industrial giant reynolds a golden opportunity the reynolds wheel line is known primarily for its outstanding contributions to the realm of aerodynamics thats understandable when considering concepts like the swirl lip generator slg rim profile which induces an aerodynamic disturbance so as to enable greater speed and stability this technology finds its way onto both the aero series wheels and the rzr series a derivative of lews progressive designs that said there is more to a reynolds wheelset than just speed these wheels are tuned to be stable in a cross wind for rider safety and their reputation for phenomenal handling backs up reynoldss claims and theres more to their lineup than road wheels with their mountain wheels being ridden to competitive success in nearly every dirtbased discipline the addition of carbon hoops for use with fat bikes and a full range of discequipped road and cyclocross wheels points to the fact that reynolds will continue to serve cyclists needs for fast reliable wheelsets and adapt with the ever changing pace of the sport subscribe to the reynolds rss feed receive every question review photo and
