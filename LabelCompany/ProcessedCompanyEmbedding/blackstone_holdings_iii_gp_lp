blackstone partnerships blackstone holdings i lp blackstone holdings ii lp blackstone holdings iii lp and blackstone holdings iv lp collectively blackstone the outlook is stable rationale the ratings are supported by stable recurring revenue and cashflow streams diverse businesses a strong balance sheet and a high level of transparency additional support comes from the patient and conservative approach applied to all aspects of its business and a marketbeating longterm track record demonstrating good performance throughout economic cycles the blackstone group lp nyse bx is a listed public company subject to sarbanes oxley and sec reporting requirements which enhances our view of governance practices the ipo brought  billion of permanent capital onto the balance sheet which was already fortified with significant cash and shortterm investment holdings blackstone has a globally respected brand and a diverse array of businesses with countercyclical elements longstanding institutional limited partners are broadly diversified blackstone has a partnership culture that drives intellectual capital across the firm and aligns interests of public and inside holders partners have strong incentives to remain with blackstone preserving and attracting new talent reputation risk slowing deal flow and large writedowns on fund investments partly balance our positive view of blackstones credit profile we believe the firm is exposed to reputation risk because over time the possibility of fund level returns failing to outperform the public equity markets could harm the brand in addition slowing deal flow in the firms private equity and real estate businesses could hurt future realizations accordingly we expect income from transactions and investment realizations to be muted through  finally recent writedowns have affected financial performance the blackstone group is a publicly traded global alternative asset manager and provider of financial advisory services with total feeearning assets under management of about  billion as of dec   business lines include the management of corporate private equity funds real estate funds funds of hedge funds creditoriented funds collateralized loan obligations and closedend mutual funds blackstone also provides a diverse array of advisory services outlook the stable outlook balances blackstones lack of balancesheet risk the firms success in recent fundraising efforts and strong performance in many of its countercyclical advisory businesses against the likelihood that private equity and real estate transaction volumes will remain slow and that asset valuations in its funds will suffer in the current recession the outlook also incorporates our expectation that reported earnings will be weak or negative through  management will limit leverage at the holding company and the balance sheet will remain strong an upgrade is unlikely in the current economic environment when economic conditions improve we could upgrade blackstone if the business continues to grow in balanced fashion either in existing or new businesses or opportunistically through acquisitions significant realized investment gains could further strengthen the balance sheet and lead to an upgrade we could downgrade blackstone if leverage increases from less than  billion to more than  billion driving the debttodebt plus equity ratio beyond  or if deployment of cash calls balancesheet liquidity into question we could also downgrade blackstone if the brand is impaired making retaining existing or raising new funds difficult ratings
