computation—informatics data analyses modeling and simulations—in biopharmaceutical drug development shows how using computation at early stages of lead candidate design or selection can help make discovery of biologic drugs more efficient thus reducing developmental costs as well as attrition rates describes applications of computational biophysics to challenges in biopharmaceutical drug development demonstrates the importance and need to increase awareness of matters related to biopharmaceutical drug development provides a starting point for discovering new applications of computation in biotherapeutics summary biopharmaceuticals are emerging as frontline medicines to combat several lifethreatening and chronic diseases however such medicines are expensive to develop and produce on a commercial scale contributing to rising healthcare costs developability of biotherapeutics computational approaches describes applications of computational and molecular modeling techniques that improve the overall process of discovery and development by removing empiricism the concept of developability involves making rational choices at the preclinical stages of biopharmaceutical drug development that could positively impact clinical outcomes the book also addresses a general lack of awareness of the many different contributions that computation can make to biopharmaceutical drug development this informative and practical reference is a valuable resource for professionals engaged in industrial research and development scientists working with regulatory agencies and pharmacy medicine and life science students and educators it focuses primarily on the developability of monoclonal antibody candidates but the principles described can also be extended to other modalities such as recombinant proteins fusion proteins antibody drug conjugates and vaccines the book is organized into two sections the first discusses principles and applications of computational approaches toward discovering and developing biopharmaceutical drugs the second presents best practices in developability assessments of earlystage biopharmaceutical drug candidates in addition to raising awareness of the promise of computational research this book also discusses solutions required to improve the success rate of translating biologic drug candidates into products available in the clinic as such it is a rich source of information on current principles and practices as well as a starting point for finding innovative applications of computation towards

is involved in several professional groups through the american association of pharmaceutical scientists and the usp was chair of the protein aggregation and immunogenicity focus group and is a frequently invited speaker at various conferences and symposia reviews ‘developability of biotherapeutics computational approaches presents the most extensive and systematic overview to date of modern computational approaches that are being used industrially to assess potential manufacturability and overall ease of development of biotherapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies the book covers a wide array of topics spanning from immunogenicity and pharmacokineticdynamic properties to key chemical and physical stability attributes it is recommended as important reading for researchers from both academic and industrial perspectives and will be of particular interest for graduate students seeking to gain an experienced perspective of the current state of the art and opportunities for high impact research in the future’ – christopher j roberts professor of chemical  biomolecular engineering university of delaware developability of biotherapeutics computational approaches presents a stateofthe art and modern overview on computational approaches for evaluating developability of biotherapeutics optimal molecule design and selection is a yet underappreciated and underutilized element of finding developing and finally commercializing the best molecule the optimum molecule not only serves patient needs by ensuring efficacy and safety but is also optimized from a technical drug product development perspective this book is a mustread for industrial and academic researchers involved in discovering identifying and optimizing molecules and transitioning from research to development and beyond – prof dr hannschristian mahler head of drug product services lonza ag ‘this book represents a compelling opening salvo to the field of computational methods applied to antibody developability the chapters are… supported by extensive and timely literature citations the average number of citations per chapter goes above 0 with over 0 of the references dating to  or later developability of biotherapeutics computational approaches should be a good addition to the libraries of industrial and academic groups engaged in or supporting development of biopharmaceutical drugs’
