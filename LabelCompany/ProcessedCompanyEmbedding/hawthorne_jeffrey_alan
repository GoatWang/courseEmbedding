following inventions this listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the united states patent and trademark office uspto patterned wafer inspection system using a nonvibrating contact potential difference sensor patent number  abstract a method and system for inspecting a surface of a material having a repeating pattern of relative work function the method and system processes sensor data to identify data characteristic of the repeating pattern and the sensor data is then further processed to remove the data characteristic of the repeating data leading to a characteristic of nonuniformities of the material surface type grant filed january   date of patent september   assignee qcept technologies inc inventors mark a schulze jun liu jeffrey alan hawthorne defect classification utilizing data from a nonvibrating contact potential difference sensor patent number  abstract a method and system for identifying and classifying nonuniformities on the surface of a semiconductor or in a semiconductor the method and system involves scanning the wafer surface with a nonvibrating contact potential difference sensor to detect the locations of nonuniformities extracting features characteristic of the nonuniformities and applying a set of rules to these features to classify the type of each nonuniformity type grant filed november   date of patent march   assignee qcept technologies inc inventors jeffrey alan hawthorne m brandon steele yeyuan yang mark schulze semiconductor inspection system and apparatus utilizing a nonvibrating contact potential difference sensor and controlled illumination patent number  abstract a method and system for identifying a defect or contamination on the surface of a semiconductor or in a semiconductor the method and system involves providing a semiconductor with a surface such as a semiconductor wafer providing a nonvibrating contact potential difference sensor providing a source of illumination with controllable intensity or distribution of wavelengths using the illumination source to provide controlled illumination of the surface of the wafer under or near the nonvibrating contact potential sensor probe tip using the nonvibrating contact potential difference sensor to scan the wafer surface during controlled illumination generating data representative of changes in contact potential difference across the wafer surface and processing that data to identify a pattern characteristic of a defect or contamination type grant filed march   date of patent february   assignee qcept technologies inc inventors jeffrey alan hawthorne m brandon steele yeyuan yang mark schulze inspection system and apparatus patent number  abstract a method and system for identifying a defect or contamination on a surface of a sample the system operates by detecting changes in work function across a surface via both vcpd and nvcpd it utilizes a nonvibrating contact potential difference nvcpd sensor for imaging work function variations over an entire sample the data is differential in that it represents changes in the work function or geometry or surface voltage across the surface of a sample a vcpd probe is used to determine absolute cpd data for specific points on the surface of the sample the combination of vibrating and nonvibrating cpd measurement modes allows the rapid imaging of wholesample uniformity and the ability to detect the absolute work function at one or more points type grant filed february   date of patent december   assignee qcept technologies inc

semiconductor or in a semiconductor the method and system involves providing a semiconductor with a surface such as a semiconductor wafer providing a nonvibrating contact potential difference sensor providing a source of illumination with controllable intensity or distribution of wavelengths using the illumination source to provide controlled illumination of the surface of the wafer under or near the nonvibrating contact potential sensor probe tip using the nonvibrating contact potential difference sensor to scan the wafer surface during controlled illumination generating data representative of changes in contact potential difference across the wafer surface and processing that data to identify a pattern characteristic of a defect or contamination type application filed march   publication date september   inventors jeffrey alan hawthorne m brandon steele yeyuan yang mark schulze inspection system and apparatus publication number  abstract a method and system for identifying a defect or contamination on a surface of a sample the system operates by detecting changes in work function across a surface via both vcpd and nvcpd it utilizes a nonvibrating contact potential difference nvcpd sensor for imaging work function variations over an entire sample the data is differential in that it represents changes in the work function or geometry or surface voltage across the surface of a sample a vcpd probe is used to determine absolute cpd data for specific points on the surface of the sample the combination of vibrating and nonvibrating cpd measurement modes allows the rapid imaging of wholesample uniformity and the ability to detect the absolute work function at one or more points type application filed february   publication date july   inventors m brandon steele
