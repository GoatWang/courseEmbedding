an executive with valeant pharmaceuticals international inc dr ari kellen was a consultant with mckinsey  company for more than two decades dr ari kellen’s work with the latter firm included extensive engagements in the corporate innovation sphere and coauthoring the article battletest your innovation strategy for the december  mckinsey quarterly the scenario presented in the article is one in which a company has taken all the right steps prior to product or service launch brainstorming prototyping testing and incorporating extensive market research and financial modeling despite a solid pathway to success the product fails to catch on and the development team is left with a failure on its hands one common reason given for lack of anticipated sales is “the competition” with rivals often taking unanticipated steps to counter the product from discounting to tying up distribution channels these threats are often difficult to detect before they actually emerge partly because the competitors keep them hidden in overcoming this a number of companies integrate “war games” simulations into their planning strategies with an aim of getting into the strategic mindset of rivals competitive insights generated can help companies adjust product and service offerings at an early stage when the outcome is malleable and changes are relatively easy to carry out search for
