united states court of appeals for the third circuit no – argued december  —decided may   respondent greg manning held over two million shares of stock in escala group inc he claims that he lost most of his investment when the share price plummeted after petitioners merrill lynch and other financial institutions collectively merrill lynch devalued escala through “naked short sales” of its stock unlike a typical short sale where a person borrows stock from a broker sells it to a buyer on the open market and later purchases the same number of shares to return to the broker the seller in a “naked” short sale does not borrow the stock he puts on the market and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer this practice which can injure shareholders by driving down a stock’s price is regulated by the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sho which prohibits shortsellers from intentionally failing to deliver securities thereby curbing market manipulation manning and other former escala shareholders collectively manning filed suit in new jersey state court alleging that merrill lynch’s actions violated new jersey law though manning chose not to bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules his complaint referred explicitly to regulation sho cataloguing past accusations against merrill lynch for flouting its requirements and suggesting that the transactions at issue had again violated the regulation merrill lynch removed the case to federal district court asserting federal jurisdiction on two grounds first it invoked the general federal question statute  u s c § which grants district courts jurisdiction of “all civil actions arising under” federal law it also invoked § the securities exchange act of  exchange act which grants federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction “of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules or regulations thereunder”  u s c §aaa manning moved to remand the case to state court arguing that neither statute gave the federal court authority to adjudicate his statelaw claims the district court denied his motion but the third circuit reversed the court first decided that § did not confer jurisdiction because manning’s claims all arose under state law and did not necessarily raise any federal issues nor was the district court the appropriate forum under § of the exchange act which the court held covers only those cases that would satisfy §’s “arising under” test for general federal jurisdiction held the jurisdictional test established by § is the same as §’s test for deciding if a case “arises under” a federal law pp – a section ’s text more readily supports this meaning than it does the parties’ two alternatives merrill lynch argues that §’s plain language requires an expansive rule any suit that either explicitly or implicitly asserts a breach of an exchange act duty is “brought to enforce” that duty even if the plaintiff seeks relief solely under state law under the natural reading of that text however § confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an exchange act requirement the “brought to enforce” language thus stops short of embracing any complaint that happens to mention a duty established by the exchange act meanwhile manning’s far more restrictive interpretation—that a suit is “brought to enforce” only if it is brought directly under that statute—veers too far in the opposite direction instead §’s language is best read to capture both suits brought under the exchange act and the rare suit in which a statelaw claim rises and falls on the plaintiff’s ability to prove the violation of a federal duty an existing jurisdictional test well captures both of these classes of suits “brought to enforce” such a duty  u s c §’s provision of federal jurisdiction of all civil actions “arising under” federal law federal jurisdiction most often attaches when federal law creates the cause of action asserted but it may also attach when the statelaw claim “necessarily raises a stated federal issue actually disputed and substantial which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance” of federal and state power grable  sons metal products inc v darue engineering  mfg  u s  pp – b this court’s precedents interpreting the term “brought to enforce” have likewise interpreted §’s jurisdictional grant as coextensive with the court’s construction of §’s “arising under” standard see pan american  u s  matsushita elec industrial co v epstein  u s  pp – c construing § consistent with both text and precedent to cover suits that arise under the exchange act serves the goals the court has consistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes it gives due deference to the important role of state courts and it promotes “administrative simplicity which is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute” hertz corp v friend  u s  both judges and litigants are familiar with the “arising under” standard and how it works and that test generally provides ready answers to jurisdictional questions pp –  f d  affirmed kagan j delivered the opinion of the court in which roberts c j and kennedy ginsburg breyer and alito jj joined thomas j filed an opinion concurring in the

third circuit may   justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court section  of the securities exchange act of  exchange act stat  as amended  u s c §a et seq grants federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction “of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules or regulations thereunder” §aaa we hold today that the jurisdictional test established by that provision is the same as the one used to decide if a case “arises under” a federal law see  u s c § i respondent greg manning held more than two million shares of stock in escala group inc a company traded on the nasdaq between  and  escala’s share price plummeted and manning lost most of his investment manning blames petitioners merrill lynch and several other financial institutions collectively merrill lynch for devaluing escala during that period through “naked short sales” of its stock a typical short sale of a security is one made by a borrower rather than an owner of stock in such a transaction a person borrows stock from a broker sells it to a buyer on the open market and later purchases the same number of shares to return to the broker the short seller’s hope is that the stock price will decline between the time he sells the borrowed shares and the time he buys replacements to pay back his loan if that happens the seller gets to pocket the difference minus associated transaction costs in a “naked” short sale by contrast the seller has not borrowed or otherwise obtained the stock he puts on the market and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer see “naked” short selling antifraud rule securities exchange commission sec release no –  fed reg   that practice beyond its effect on individual purchasers can serve “as a tool to drive down a company’s stock price”—which of course injures shareholders like manning id at  the sec regulates such short sales at the federal level the commission’s regulation sho issued under the exchange act prohibits short sellers from intentionally failing to deliver securities and thereby curbs market manipulation see  cfr §§–  in this lawsuit manning joined by six other former escala shareholders alleges that merrill lynch facilitated and engaged in naked short sales of escala stock in violation of new jersey law his complaint asserts that merrill lynch participated in “short sales at times when it neither possessed nor had any intention of obtaining sufficient stock” to deliver to buyers app to pet for cert a amended complaint ¶ that conduct manning charges contravened provisions of the new jersey racketeerinfluenced and corrupt organizations act rico new jersey criminal code and new jersey uniform securities law it also he adds ran afoul of the new jersey common law of negligence unjust enrichment and interference with contractual relations see id at a–a ¶¶– manning chose not to bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules his complaint however referred explicitly to regulation sho both describing the purposes of that rule and cataloguing past accusations against merrill lynch for flouting its requirements see id at a–a ¶¶– a–a ¶¶– and the complaint couched its description of the short selling at issue here in terms suggesting that merrill lynch had again violated that regulation in addition to infringing new jersey law see id at a–a ¶¶– manning brought his complaint in new jersey state court but merrill lynch removed the case to federal district court see  u s c § allowing removal of any civil action of which federal district courts have original jurisdiction merrill lynch asserted federal jurisdiction on two grounds first it invoked the general federal question statute § which grants district courts jurisdiction of “all civil actions arising under” federal law second it maintained that the suit belonged in federal court by virtue of § of the exchange act that provision in relevant part grants district courts exclusive jurisdiction of “all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder”  u s c §aaa manning moved to remand the case to state court arguing that neither statute gave the federal court authority to adjudicate his collection of statelaw claims the district court denied his motion see no – d nj mar   app to pet for cert a–a the court of appeals for the third circuit reversed ordering a remand of the case to state court see  f d   the third circuit first decided that the federal question statute  u s c § did not confer jurisdiction of the suit because all manning’s claims were “brought under state law” and none “necessarily raised” a federal issue  f d at   nor the court held did § of the exchange act make the district court the appropriate forum relying on this court’s construction of a nearly identical jurisdictional provision the court of appeals found that § covers only those cases involving the exchange act that would satisfy the “arising under” test of the federal question statute see id at – citing pan american petroleum corp v superior court of del for new castle cty  u s    because the district court lacked jurisdiction of manning’s suit under § so too it was not the exclusive forum under § merrill lynch sought this court’s review solely as to whether § commits manning’s case to federal court see pet for cert i because of a circuit split about that provision’s meaning  we granted certiorari  u s   we now affirm ii like the third circuit we read § as conferring exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same suits as “arise under” the exchange act pursuant to the general federal question statute see  u s c § the text of § more readily supports that meaning than it does either of the parties’ two alternatives this court’s precedents interpreting identical statutory language positively compel that conclusion and the construction fits with our practice of reading jurisdictional laws so long as consistent with their language to respect the traditional role of state courts in our federal system and to establish clear and administrable rules a section  as noted earlier provides federal district courts with exclusive jurisdiction “of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder”  u s c §aaa see supra at   much the same wording appears in nine other federal jurisdictional provisions—mostly enacted like § as part of new dealera regulatory statutes  merrill lynch argues that the “plain unambiguous language” of § requires an expansive understanding of its scope brief for petitioners  whenever says merrill lynch a plaintiff’s complaint either explicitly or implicitly “asserts” that “the defendant breached an exchange act duty” then the suit is “brought to enforce” that duty and a federal court has exclusive jurisdiction id at  reply brief – see tr of oral arg – confirming that such allegations need not be express that is so merrill lynch contends even if the plaintiff as in this case brings only statelaw claims in his complaint—that is seeks relief solely under state law see reply brief – and it is so merrill lynch continues even if the plaintiff can prevail on those claims without proving that the alleged breach of an exchange act duty—here the violation of regulation sho—actually occurred see id at – tr of oral arg  “the words ‘brought to enforce’ donot focus on what the court would necessarily have to decide” but a natural reading of §’s text does not extend so far “brought” in this context means “commenced” black’s law dictionary  d ed  “to” is a word “expressing purpose or consequence” the concise oxford dictionary   and “enforce” means “give force or effect to”  webster’s new international dictionary of the english language   so § confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an exchange act requirement that language in emphasizing what the suit is designed to accomplish stops short of embracing any complaint that happens to mention a duty established by the exchange act consider for example a simple statelaw action for breach of contract in which the plaintiff alleges for atmospheric reasons that the defendant’s conduct also violated the exchange act—or still less that the defendant is a bad actor who infringed that statute on another occasion on merrill lynch’s view § would cover that suit indeed merrill lynch points to just such incidental assertions as the basis for federal jurisdiction here see brief for petitioners – supra at  but that hypothetical suit is “brought to enforce” state contract law not the exchange act—because the plaintiff can get all the relief he seeks just by showing the breach of an agreement without proving any violation of federal securities law the suit that is can achieve all it is supposed to even if issues involving the exchange act never come up critiquing merrill lynch’s position on similar grounds manning proposes a far more restrictive interpretation of §’s language—one going beyond what he needs to prevail see brief for respondents – according to manning a suit is “brought to enforce” the exchange act’s duties or liabilities only if it is brought directly under that statute—that is only if the claims it asserts and not just the duties it means to vindicate are created by the exchange act on that view everything depends as justice holmes famously said in another jurisdictional context on which law “creates the cause of action” american well works co v layne  bowler co  u s     if a complaint asserts a right of action deriving from the exchange act or an associated regulation the suit must proceed in federal court but if as here the complaint brings only statecreated claims then the case belongs in a state forum and that is so manning claims even if—contrary to what the third circuit held below—the success of the state claim necessarily hinges on proving that the defendant breached an exchange act duty see brief for respondents  manning’s view of the text’s requirements although better than merrill lynch’s veers too far in the opposite direction there is no doubt as manning says that a suit asserting an exchange act cause of action fits within §’s scope bringing such a suit is the prototypical way of enforcing an exchange act duty but it is not the only way on rare occasions as just suggested a suit raising a statelaw claim rises or falls on the plaintiff’s ability to prove the violation of a federal duty see eg grable  sons metal products inc v darue engineering  mfg  u s –  smith v kansas city title  trust co  u s     if in that manner a statelaw action necessarily depends on a showing that the defendant breached the exchange act then that suit could also fall within §’s compass suppose for example that a state statute simply makes illegal “any violation of the exchange act involving naked short selling” a plaintiff seeking relief under that state law must undertake to prove as the cornerstone of his suit that the defendant infringed a requirement of the federal statute indeed in this hypothetical that is the plaintiff’s only project accordingly his suit even though asserting a statecreated claim is also “brought to enforce” a duty created by the exchange act an existing jurisdictional test well captures both classes of suits “brought to enforce” such a duty as noted earlier  u s c § provides federal jurisdiction of all civil actions “arising under” federal law see supra at  this court has found that statutory term satisfied in either of two circumstances most directly and most often federal jurisdiction attaches when federal law creates the cause of action asserted that set of cases is what manning highlights in offering his view of § but even when “a claim finds its origins” in state law there is “a special and small category of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies” gunn v minton  u s    slip op at  internal quotation marks omitted as this court has explained a federal court has jurisdiction of a statelaw claim if it “necessarily raises a stated federal issue actually disputed and substantial which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance” of federal and state power grable  u s at  see gunn  u s at  slip op at  framing the same standard as a fourpart test that description typically fits cases like those described just above in which a statelaw cause of action is “brought to enforce” a duty created by the exchange act because the claim’s very success depends on giving effect to a federal requirement accordingly we agree with the court below that §’s jurisdictional test matches the one we have formulated for § as applied to cases involving the exchange act if but only if such a case meets the “arising under” standard § commands that it go to federal court  merrill lynch objects that our rule construes “completely different language”—ie the phrases “arising under”and “brought to enforce” in § and § respectively—“to mean exactly the same thing” reply brief  we cannot deny that point but we think it far less odd than merrill lynch does after all the test for § jurisdiction is not grounded in that provision’s particular phrasing this court has long read the words “arising under” in article iii to extend quite broadly “to all cases in which a federal question is ‘an ingredient’ of the action” merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc v thompson  u s  quoting osborn v bank of united states  wheat    in the statutory context however we opted to give those same words a narrower scope “in the light of §’s history the demands of reason and coherence and the dictates of sound judicial policy” romero v international terminal operating co  u s     because the resulting test does not turn on §’s text there is nothing remarkable in its fitting as or even more neatly a differently worded statutory provision nor can merrill lynch claim that congress’s use of the new “brought to enforce” language in § shows an intent to depart from a settled even if linguistically ungrounded test for statutory “arising under” jurisdiction that is because no such welldefined test then existed as we recently noted our caselaw construing § was for many decades—including when the exchange act passed—highly “unruly” gunn  u s at  slip op at  referring to the “canvas” of our old opinions as “looking like one that jackson pollock got to first” against that muddled backdrop it is impossible to infer that congress in enacting § wished to depart from what we now understand as the “arising under” standard b this court has reached the same conclusion before in two unrelated decisions we addressed the “brought to enforce” language at issue here see pan american  u s  matsushita elec industrial co v epstein  u s    each time we viewed that phrase as coextensive with our construction of “arising under” pan american involved § of the natural gas act nga  u s c §u—an exclusive jurisdiction provision containing language materially indistinguishable from §’s  the case began in state court when a natural gas purchaser sued a producer for breach of a contract setting sale prices prior to the alleged breach the producer had filed those contractual rates with the federal power commission as the nga required relying on that submission which the complaint did not mention the producer claimed that the buyer’s suit was “brought to enforce” a liability deriving from the nga—ie a filed rate—and so must proceed in federal court see  u s at  this court rejected the argument our decision explained that §’s use of the term “brought to enforce” rather than “arising under” made no difference to the jurisdictional analysis the inquiry we wrote was “not affected by want” of the language contained in the federal question statute id at  n  the “limitations” associated with “arising under” jurisdiction we continued were “clearly implied” in §’s alternative phrasing ibid in short the linguistic distinction between the two jurisdictional provisions did not extend to their meaning pan american thus went on to analyze the jurisdictional issue in the manner set out in our “arising under” precedents federal question jurisdiction lies the court wrote only if “it appears from the face of the complaint that determination of the suit depends upon a question of federal law” id at  that inquiry focuses on “the particular claims a suitor makes” in his complaint—meaning whether the plaintiff seeks relief under state or federal law id at  in addition the court suggested a federal court could adjudicate a suit stating only a statelaw claim if it included as “an element and an essential one” the violation of a federal right id at  quoting gully v first nat bank in meridian  u s     with those principles of “arising under” jurisdiction laid out the court held that § did not enable a federal court to resolve the buyer’s case because he could prevail merely by proving breach of the contract see  u s at – pan american establishes then that an action “brought to enforce” a duty or liability created by a federal statute is nothing more and nothing less than an action “arising under” that law merrill lynch reads pan american more narrowly as holding only that § does not confer federal jurisdiction when a complaint unlike manning’s fails to reference federal law at all see brief for petitioners –  but that argument ignores pan american’s express statement of equivalence between §’s language and the federal question statute’s “brought to enforce” has the same “limitations” meaning the same scope as “arising under”  u s at  n  and just as important merrill lynch disregards pan american’s analytical structure the decision proceeds by reviewing this court’s “arising under” precedents articulating the principles animating that caselaw and then applying those tenets to the dispute at hand id at – the court thus showed as well as told that “brought to enforce” jurisdiction mirrors that of “arising under” as a fallback merrill lynch claims that pan american is irrelevant here because it relied on legislative history distinct to the nga in finding §’s “brought to enforce” language coterminous with “arising under” see brief for petitioners – the premise of that argument is true enough in support of its holding the court quoted a committee report describing § as conferring federal jurisdiction “over cases arising under the act”  u s at  n  but we cannot accept the conclusion merrill lynch draws from that statement that courts should give two identically worded statutory provisions passed less than five years apart markedly different meanings indeed the result of merrill lynch’s approach is still odder for what of the eight other jurisdictional provisions containing “brought to enforce” language see n  supra presumably merrill lynch would have courts inspect each of their legislative histories to decide whether to read those statutes as reproducing the “arising under” standard adopting merrill lynch’s alternative view or demanding yet another jurisdictional test we are hard pressed to imagine a less sensible way of construing the repeated iterations of the phrase “brought to enforce” in the jurisdictional provisions of the federal code in any event this court in matsushita addressed § itself and once again equated the “brought to enforce” and “arising under” standards that decision arose from a statelaw action against corporate directors for breach of fiduciary duty the issue was whether the state court handling the suit could approve a settlement releasing in addition to the state claims actually brought potential exchange act claims that § would have committed to federal court in deciding that the state court could do so we described §—not once not twice but three times—as conferring exclusive jurisdiction of suits “arising under” the exchange act see  u s at  section  “confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal courts for suits arising under the exchange act” id at  section  “prohibits state courts from adjudicating claims arising under the exchange act” id at  section  “prohibits state courts from exercising jurisdiction over suits arising under the exchange act” emphases added over and over then the court took as a given that §’s jurisdictional test mimicked the one in the general federal question statute and still more the matsushita court thought clear that the suit as filed—which closely resembled manning’s in its mix of state and federal law—fell outside §’s grant of exclusive jurisdiction as just noted the claims brought in the matsushita complaint sought relief for breach of a statelaw duty but in support of those claims the plaintiffs charged much as manning did here that the defendants’ conduct also violated federal securities laws see  u s at  supra at – we found the presence of that accusation insufficient to trigger § “the cause pleaded” we wrote remained “a state commonlaw action”  u s at  n  notwithstanding the potential federal issue the suit “was not ‘brought to enforce’ any rights or obligations under the exchange act” id at  the court thus rejected the very position merrill lynch takes here—ie that § precludes a state court from adjudicating any case even if brought under state law in which the plaintiff asserts an exchange act breach c construing § consistent with both text and precedent to cover suits that arise under the exchange act serves the goals we have consistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes our reading unlike merrill lynch’s gives due deference to the important role of state courts in our federal system and the standard we adopt is more straightforward and administrable than the alternative merrill lynch offers out of respect for state courts this court has time and again declined to construe federal jurisdictional statutes more expansively than their language most fairly read requires we have reiterated the need to give “due regard to the rightful independence of state governments”—and more particularly to the power of the states “to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts” romero  u s at  quoting healy v ratta  u s     shamrock oil  gas corp v sheets  u s     our decisions as we once put the point reflect a “deeply felt and traditional reluctance    to expand the jurisdiction of federal courts through a broad reading of jurisdictional statutes” romero  u s at   that interpretive stance serves among other things to keep statelaw actions like manning’s in state court and thus to help maintainthe constitutional balance between state and federaljudiciaries nor does this court’s concern for state court prerogatives disappear as merrill lynch suggests it should in the face of a statute granting exclusive federal jurisdiction see brief for petitioners – to the contrary when a statute mandates rather than permits federal jurisdiction—thus depriving state courts of all ability to adjudicate certain claims—our reluctance to endorse “broad readings” romero  u s at  if anything grows stronger and that is especially so when as here the construction offered would place in federal court actions bringing only claims created by state law—even if those claims might raise federal issues to be sure a grant of exclusive federal jurisdiction as merrill lynch reminds us indicates that congress wanted “greater uniformity of construction and more effective and expert application” of federal law than usual brief for petitioners  quoting matsushita  u s at  but “greater” and “more” do not mean “total” and the critical question remains how far such a grant extends in resolving that issue we will not lightly read the statute to alter the usual constitutional balance as it would by sending actions with all statelaw claims to federal court just because a complaint references a federal duty our precedents construing other exclusive grants of federal jurisdiction illustrate those principles in pan american for example we denied that a state court’s resolution of statelaw claims potentially implicating the nga’s meaning would “jeopardize the uniform system of regulation” that the statute established  u s at  we reasoned that this court’s ability to review state court decisions of federal questions would sufficiently protect federal interests and similarly in tafflin v levitt  u s –  we permitted state courts to adjudicate civil rico actions that might raise issues about the scope of federal crimes alleged as predicate acts even though federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction “of all offenses against the laws of the united states”  u s c § there we expressed confidence that state courts would look to federal court interpretations of the relevant criminal statutes accordingly we saw “no significant danger of inconsistent application of federal criminal law” and no “incompatibility with federal interests” tafflin  u s at –  internal quotation marks omitted so too here when state courts in deciding statelaw claims address possible issues of the exchange act’s meaning not even merrill lynch thinks those decisions wholly avoidable it admits that § does nothing to prevent state courts from resolving exchange act questions that result from defenses or counterclaims see brief for petitioners – pan american  u s at – we see little difference in terms of the uniformitybased policies merrill lynch invokes if those issues instead appear in a complaint like manning’s and indeed congress likely contemplated that some complaints intermingling state and federal questions would be brought in state court after all congress specifically affirmed the capacity of such courts to hear statelaw securities actions which predictably raise issues coinciding overlapping or intersecting with those under the act itself see  u s c §bba matsushita  u s at  so for example it is hardly surprising in a suit like this one alleging short sales in violation of state securities law that a plaintiff might say the defendant previously breached a federal prohibition of similar conduct see supra at – describing manning’s complaint and it is less troubling for a state court to consider such an issue than to lose all ability to adjudicate a suit raising only statelaw causes of action reading § in line with our § caselaw also promotes “administrative simplicity which is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute” hertz corp v friend  u s     both judges and litigants are familiar with the “arising under” standard and how it works for the most part that test provides ready answers to jurisdictional questions and an existing body of precedent gives guidance whenever borderline cases crop up see supra at – by contrast no one has experience with merrill lynch’s alternative standard which would spring out of nothing to govern suits involving not only the exchange act but up to nine other discrete spheres of federal law see n  supra listing statutes with “brought to enforce” language supra at – noting merrill lynch’s backup claim that legislative histories might compel different tests for different statutes adopting such an untested approach and forcing courts to toggle back and forth between it and the “arising under” standard would undermine consistency and predictability in litigation that result disserves courts and parties alike making matters worse merrill lynch’s rule is simple for plaintiffs to avoid—or else excruciating for courts to police under that rule a plaintiff electing to bring statelaw claims in state court will purge his complaint of any references to federal securities law so as to escape removal such omissions after all will do nothing to change the way the plaintiff can present his case at trial they will merely make the complaint less informative recognizing the potential for that kind of avoidance merrill lynch argues that a judge should go behind the face of a complaint to determine whether it is the product of “artful pleading” see tr of oral arg  if the plaintiffs “had just literally whited out deleted the references to regulation sho” the court should still understand the complaint to allege a breach of that rule “the fact that the plaintiffs didn’t cite it wouldn’t change the fact” we have no idea how a court would make that judgment and get cold comfort from merrill lynch’s assurance that the question would arise not in this case but in “the next third fourth fifth case down the road” id at  jurisdictional tests are built for more than a single dispute that merrill lynch’s threatens to become either a useless drafting rule or a tortuous inquiry into artful pleading is one more good reason to reject it iii section  provides exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same class of cases as “arise under” the exchange act for purposes of § the text of § most naturally read supports that rule this court has adopted the same view in two prior cases and that reading of the statute promotes the twin goals important in interpreting jurisdictional grants of respecting state courts and providing administrable standards our holding requires remanding manning’s suit to state court the third circuit found that the district court did not have jurisdiction of manning’s suit under § because all his claims sought relief under state law and none necessarily raised a federal issue see supra at  merrill lynch did not challenge that ruling and we therefore take it as a given and that means under our decision today that the district court also lacked jurisdiction under § accordingly we affirm the judgment below it is so ordered notes  compare  f d  ca  case below with barbara v new york stock exchange inc  f d   ca  construing § more narrowly sparta surgical corp v national assn of securities dealers inc  f d  – ca  construing § more broadly and hawkins v national assn of securities dealers inc  f d  – ca  per curiam same  section  also grants federal courts exclusive jurisdiction of “violations of the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder”  u s c §aaa manning argues that the “violations” language applies only to criminal proceedings and sec enforcement actions see brief for respondents  merrill lynch although not conceding that much believes the “violations” clause irrelevant here because in private suits for damages it goes no further than the “brought to enforce” language quoted in the text see reply brief  n  given that both parties have thus taken the “violations” language off the table we do not address its meaning  see securities act of   u s c §va federal power act of   u s c §p connally hot oil act of   u s c §ic natural gas act

full disclosure act of   u s c §  the concurrence adopts a slightly different approach placing in federal court exchange act claims plus all statelaw claims necessarily raising an exchange act issue see post at – thomas j concurring in judgment in other words the concurrence would not ask as the “arising under” test does whether the federal issue embedded in such a statelaw claim is also substantial actually disputed and capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the congressionally approved federalstate balance see post at – grable  sons metal products inc v darue engineering  mfg  u s     but this court has not construed any jurisdictional statute whether using the words “brought to enforce” or “arising under” or for that matter any other to draw the concurrence’s line for as long as we have contemplated exercising federal jurisdiction over statelaw claims necessarily raising federal issues we have inquired as well into whether those issues are “really and substantially” disputed see eg hopkins v walker  u s     shulthis v mcdougal  u s     and similarly we have long emphasized the need in such circumstances to make “sensitive judgments about congressional intent judicial power and the federal system” merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc v thompson  u s     at this late juncture we see no virtue in trying to pull apart these interconnected strands of necessity and substantialityplus indeed doing so here—and thus creating a gap between our “brought to enforce” and “arising under” standards—would conflict with this court’s precedent and undermine important goals of interpreting jurisdictional statutes see infra at – discussing our prior decisions equating the two tests – highlighting the need to respect state courts and the benefits of using a single timetested standard  section  grants federal courts exclusive jurisdiction “of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by    the nga or any rule regulation or order thereunder” stat   the romero court continued “a reluctance which must be even more forcefully felt when the expansion is proposed for the first time eightythree years after the jurisdiction has been conferred”  u s at  the exchange act was passed a mere  years ago but we believe the point still stands top concurrence supreme court of the united states  no –  merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incet al petitioners v greg manning et al on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit may   justice thomas with whom justice sotomayor joins concurring in the judgment the court concludes that respondents’ suit belongs in state court because it does not satisfy the multifactor atextual standard that we have used to assess whether a suit is one “arising under” federal law  u s c § ante at  i agree that this suit belongs in state court but i would rest that conclusion on the statute before us § of the securities exchange act of   u s c §aa that statute does not use the phrase “arising under” or provide a sound basis for adopting the arisingunder standard it instead provides federal jurisdiction where a suit is “brought to enforce” exchange act requirements §aaa that language establishes a straightforward test if a complaint alleges a claim that necessarily depends on a breach of a requirement created by the act § confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over that suit because the complaint here does not allege such claims—and because no other statute confers federal jurisdiction—this suit should return to state court accordingly i concur in the judgment i a section  provides that “the district courts    shall have exclusive jurisdiction    of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder” §aaa   as the court explains under a “natural reading” § “confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an exchange act requirement” ante at  see also webster’s new international dictionary of the english language   “enforce” means “give force to” or “give effect to” and by providing “exclusive jurisdiction” to federal district courts over certain suits § strips state courts of jurisdiction over such suits put differently under § a suit belongs in federal court when the complaint requires a court to enforce an exchange act duty or liability in contrast a suit belongs in state court when the complaint “asserts purely statelaw causes of action” that do not require “binding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the exchange act” or “a judgment on the merits of” an exchange act breach matsushita elec industrial co v epstein  u s      such a suit is “not ‘brought to enforce’ any rights or obligations under the act” and thus does not fall within §’s scope id at  so § does not provide federal jurisdiction over suits brought to enforce liabilities or duties under state law or over every case that happens to involve allegations that the act was violated the provision leaves state courts with some authority over suits involving the act or its regulations the statutory context bolsters this understanding that context confirms that congress reserved some authority to state courts to adjudicate securitieslaw mattersalthough the act provides numerous federal “rights and remedies” it also generally preserves “all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity” such as claims that could be litigated in state courts of general jurisdiction  u s c §bba that provision shows that “congress plainly contemplated the possibility of dual litigation in state and federal courts relating to securities transactions” matsushita supra at  a natural reading of §’s text preserves the dual role for federal and state courts that congress contemplated and it confirms that mere allegations of exchange act breaches do not alone deprive state courts of jurisdiction a natural reading promotes the uniform interpretation of the federal securities laws that congress sought to ensure when it gave federal courts “exclusive jurisdiction” over federal securitieslaw suits §aaa the textual approach fosters uniformity because it leaves to federal courts—which are presumptively more familiar with the intricate federal securities laws—the task of “adjudicating    exchange act claims” matsushita  u s at  when state courts decide cases where the complaint pleads only statelaw claims and do not resolve the merits of exchange act rights or liabilities they are not “trespassing upon the exclusive territory of the federal courts” id at  the statutory text and structure thus support a straightforward test section  confers federal jurisdiction over a case if the complaint alleges claims that necessarily depend on establishing a breach of an exchange act requirement b the third circuit was correct to remand this suit to state court respondents’ complaint does not seek “to enforce any liability or duty created by” the exchange act or its regulations §aaa although respondents’ complaint alleges at different places that petitioners violated the exchange act or its regulations the complaint does not bring claims requiring enforcement of the exchange act or its regulations the complaint instead brings  statelaw causes of action that seek to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law count  alleges that petitioners violated state law by investing money derived from racketeering see app to pet for cert a–a amended complaint ¶¶– citing n j stat ann §c–a west  counts  through  allege standard statelaw contract and tort claims unjust enrichment unlawful interference with economic advantage tortious interference with contractual relations unlawful interference with contractual relations thirdpartybeneficiary claims breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and negligence see app to pet for cert a–a amended complaint ¶¶– count  pleads a freestanding claim for punitive and exemplary damages see id at a amended complaint ¶¶– none of these claims requires a court to “enforce”—to give effect to—a requirement created by the act thus § does not confer federal jurisdiction over them count  presents a closer call but it too does not trigger federal jurisdiction that count pleads that petitioners violated a state law that makes it unlawful for a person to participate in a racketeering enterprise id at a–a amended complaint ¶¶– citing n j stat ann §c–c the alleged racketeering includes violating the new jersey uniform securities law through fraud deception and misappropriation committing “theft by taking” under state law and committing “theft by deception” under state law app to pet for cert a–a amended complaint ¶¶– respondents allege that “the sec has expressly noted that naked short selling involves the omission of a material fact” as part of their statelaw securities fraud allegation id at a amended complaint ¶ vindicating that claim would not require the enforcement of a federal duty or liability new jersey law encompasses fraudulent conduct that does not necessarily rest on a violation of federal law or regulation see eg §–e west  fraud and deceit include “any misrepresentation by word conduct or in any manner of any material fact either present or past and any omission to disclose any such fact” see app to pet for cert a–a invoking §– et seq so although count  refers to the securities and exchange commission’s view about naked short selling that count does not require respondents to establish a violation of federal securities law to prevail on their fraud claim because respondents’ cause of action in count  seeks to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law and does not necessarily depend on the breach of an exchange act duty or liability § does not provide federal jurisdiction over that claim ii although the court acknowledges the “natural reading” of § ante at  it holds that § adopts the jurisdictional test that this court uses to evaluate federalquestion jurisdiction under  u s c § see ante at – see also ante at – federal courts have the power to review cases “arising under” federal law § including those in which the complaint brings statelaw claims that “necessarily raise a stated federal issue actually disputed and substantial which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities” grable  sons metal products inc v darue engineering  mfg  u s     the court wrongly equates the phrase “arising under” in § with the phrase “brought to enforce” in § and interprets the latter to require that a case raising statelaw claims “meet the ‘arising under’ standard” for that case to proceed in federal court ante at  see ante at – none of the court’s rationales for adopting that rule is persuasive a the court first argues that “it is impossible to infer that congress in enacting § wished to depart from what we now understand as the ‘arising under’ standard” because there was no “welldefined test” to depart from ante at  the court’s case law construing § the court explains “was for many decades—including when the exchange act passed—highly unruly” ibid internal quotation marks omitted but when congress enacts a statute that uses different language from a prior statute we normally presume that congress did so to convey a different meaning see eg crawford v burke  u s    explaining that “a change in phraseology creates a presumption of a change in intent” and that “congress would not have used such different language in two statutes without thereby intending a change of meaning” given what we know about § that presumption has force here our § case law was as the court notes “highly unruly” when the exchange act was enacted in  given the importance of clarity in jurisdictional statutes see hertz corp v friend  u s     it is quite a stretch to infer that congress wished to embrace such an unpredictable test that is especially true given that § does not use words supporting the convoluted arisingunder standard section  does not ask for example whether a federal issue is substantial or whether a ruling on that issue will upset the congressionally approved balance of federal and state power indeed § itself does not even use words supporting the arisingunder standard see ante at  acknowledging that the arisingunder standard “does not turn on §’s text” rather the court has refused to give full effect to §’s “broad phrasing” and has instead “continuously construed and limited” that provision based on extratextual considerations such as “history” “the demands of reason and coherence” and “sound judicial policy” romero v international terminal operating co  u s     faced with a plain and focused text like § however we should not rely on such considerations and importing factors from our § arisingunder jurisprudence—such as a substantiality requirement and a federalstate balance requirement—risks narrowing the class of cases that congress meant to cover with §’s plain text for these reasons it is unwise to read into § a decision to adopt the arisingunder standard b the court next relies on two prior decisions—pan american petroleum corp v superior court of del for new castle cty  u s    and matsushita  u s  see ante at – neither case justifies the court’s decision to apply the arisingunder standard to § in pan american the court held that delaware state courts had jurisdiction over statelaw contract claims that arose from contracts for the sale of natural gas  u s at – the court reached that decision even though a provision of the natural gas act provided exclusive federal jurisdiction over suits “ ‘brought to enforce any liability or duty created by’ ” that act id at  quoting statute pan american lends some support to the court’s view today it applied the court’s arisingunder precedents and “explained that the natural gas act’s use of the term ‘brought to enforce’ rather than ‘arising under’ made no difference to the jurisdictional analysis” ante at  see pan american supra at  n  see also ante at – but pan american does not require the court to engraft the arisingunder standard onto § pan american did not carefully analyze the natural gas act’s text or assess the contemporary meaning of the central phrase “brought to enforce” instead the court relied on legislative history reasoning that “authoritative congressional committee reports” implied a limitation on the natural gas act’s jurisdictional text  u s at  n  that reasoning does not warrant our respect that is especially true because pan american’s holding is consistent with the natural gas act’s “brought to enforce” language the complaint in that case did not “assert” any “right    under the natural gas act” and instead asked the court to adjudicate standard statelaw “contract or quasicontract” claims id at   the court’s disposition in pan american rests as comfortably on the statutory text as it does on the arisingunder standard matsushita provides even less support for the court’s holding today in that case the court held that delaware courts could issue a judgment approving a settlement releasing securitieslaw claims even though the settlement released claims that were by virtue of § “solely within the jurisdiction of the federal courts”  u s at  see id at – the court explained that “while § prohibits state courts from adjudicating claims arising under the exchange act it does not prohibit state courts from approving the release of exchange act claims in the settlement of suits over which they have properly exercised jurisdiction ie suits arising under state law or under federal law for which there is concurrent jurisdiction” id at  because the complaint in that case “asserted purely statelaw causes of action” and the state courts did not issue “a judgment on the merits of the exclusively federal claims” § did not deprive state courts of jurisdiction id at  the court relies on matsushita because in that case we three times “described” § “as conferring exclusive jurisdiction of suits ‘arising under’ the exchange act” ante at  citing  u s at    but matsushita did not decide whether § adopts the arisingunder standard so its passing use of the phrase “arising under” cannot bear the weight that the court now places on it to be sure matsushita does support the court’s judgment today matsushita emphasized that state courts could adjudicate a suit involving securitieslaw issues where the complaint “asserted purely statelaw causes of action” and did not require the state courts to issue “binding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the exchange act” or “a judgment on the merits of” an exchange act breach id at   but those statements are more consistent with §’s text than they are with the arisingunder standard see supra at – invoking matsushita c finally the court argues that its interpretation “serves the goals” that our precedents have “consistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes”—affording proper deference to state courts and promoting administrable jurisdictional rules ante at  see ante at – but hewing to §’s text serves these goals as well as or better than does adopting the arisingunder standard first the textbased view preserves state courts’ authority to adjudicate numerous securitieslaw claims and provide relief consistent with the exchange act’s design see supra at – as explained above that view places all of respondents’ statelaw causes of action in state court see supra at – the textbased view thus “declines to construe a federal jurisdictional statute more expansively than its language most fairly read requires” ante at  second the textual test is also more administrable than the arisingunder standard the arisingunder standard “is anything but clear” grable  u s at  thomas j concurring the standard involves numerous judgments about matters of degree that are not readily susceptible to bright lines as noted to satisfy that standard a statelaw claim must raise a federal issue that is among other things “actually disputed” is “substantial” and will not “disturb” a congressionally approved federalstate “balance” id at  opinion of court the standard “calls for a ‘commonsense accommodation of judgment to the kaleidoscopic situations’ that present a federal issue in ‘a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside’ ” id at  quoting gully v first nat bank in meridian  u s –  the arisingunder standard may be many things but it is not one that consistently “provides ready answers” to hard jurisdictional questions ante at  the textbased view promises better i would adopt that view and apply it here      for these reasons i concur in the

similar to the secs fraud charges against goldman sachs and its abacaus cdos rabobank alleged that a hedge fund named magnetar capital had chosen assets to go into norma and allegedly bet against them but that merrill had not informed rabobank of this fact instead rabobank alleges that merrill told it that nir group was selecting the assets when the cdo value tanked rabobank was left owing merrill

performance bonus that according to company policy was supposed to reflect all four quarters of performance and was paid in january or later in this case however the bonuses were awarded in december before fourthquarter performance had been determined they were also very large relative to the tarp monies allocated to merrill the merrill bonuses were the equivalent of  of tarp monies treasury

fenner  smith incorporated  world financial center new york ny  defendant        civil action no complaint plaintiff securities and exchange commission the commission or sec alleges nature of the action  the commission brings this action against defendant merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated to redress its violations of the federal securities laws and several rules of conduct of nasd inc nasd and the new york stock exchange inc nyse  during the period january   to december   the relevant period as enumerated below merrill lynch published research reports on two internet companies that violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and published research reports on five other internet companies that expressed views inconsistent with the analysts privately expressed negative views in violation of nasds and nyses advertising rules those rules require that among other things published research reports have a reasonable basis present a fair picture of the investment risks and benefits and not make exaggerated or unwarranted claims  on various occasions during the relevant period merrill lynch allowed its investment banking function to exercise undue influence over research analysts thereby resulting in conflicts of interest for its research analysts and it failed to manage these conflicts in an adequate or appropriate manner these circumstances arose from a combination of forces including the following i merrill lynchs investment banking division unduly influenced the analysts decisions regarding whether to provide research coverage for a particular stock and how to rate that stock ii merrill lynch encouraged research analysts to participate regularly in investment bankings marketing activities prior to the publication of research and coordinated their research coverage with investment banking iii in certain instances merrill lynch investment bankers and actual and prospective investment banking clients reviewed draft research reports and ratings before publication and merrill lynch used research in conjunction with investment banking to generate banking business and iv merrill lynchs compensation of research analysts was influenced by the analysts contributions to investment banking revenue  merrill lynchs policies and procedures that were intended to maintain the independence of research analysts from investment banking were inadequate to ensure its research analysts issued objective research and were not compromised by the conflicts of interest described above as a result merrill lynch failed to adequately supervise the activities and conduct of its research analysts jurisdiction  this court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to sections d e f and  of the securities exchange act of  exchange act  usc §§ ud ue uf and aa  merrill lynch directly or indirectly used the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce of the mails or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts practices and courses of business alleged herein  venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to section  of the exchange act  usc § aa because defendant is found has its headquarters and principal executive offices and transacts business in this district defendant  merrill lynch a registered brokerdealer is a member of nasd and nyse its principal offices are located in new york city merrill lynch engages in a fullservice securities business including retail and institutional sales investment banking services trading and research factual allegations i overview of internet research at merrill lynch  during the relevant period merrill lynch divided its research analysts into sectors that each covered a discrete industry and published written research reports on selected companies within each sector the three basic types of research reports issued by merrill lynch  bulletins comments and indepth reports  differed in length and level of detail bulletins did not include models charts or other exhibits that would typically be included in a comment or indepth report  from february  through december  merrill lynch employed henry blodget as a senior research analyst to cover the internet sector and to head a group of analysts who issued and who assisted him in issuing research reports and ratings on internet companies the internet research group covered internet and similar technology stocks during this period blodget was first vicepresident and managing director for merrill lynch and the senior research analyst for the internet sector the analyst principally responsible for each research report published by merrill lynch on covered internet companies was usually listed first on the report  merrill lynch divided the internet sector into the following three subsectors i consumer internet ecommerce and new media ii internet infrastructure services and iii business to business internet companies blodget wrote reviewed andor consulted with other analysts regarding research generated by the internet sector and was the senior research analyst on all but a handful of the research reports discussed below  each merrill lynch research report included an investment rating that was intended to reflect the analysts opinion on how the stock would perform during  to may  merrill lynch stated that it used the following fivepoint rating system   buy   accumulate   neutral   reduce   sell  merrill lynch however did not rate any internet stock a  and rated only one internet stock a  during the relevant period with respect to each of the research reports discussed below the descriptive words eg buy accumulate etc representing the analysts intermediate and longterm ratings appeared in the upper right corner of the research report in bold capital letters and in a font larger than in the text of the research report  the descriptive words were to reflect the analysts opinion of the stocks price appreciation potential over the intermediate term  to  months from the date of rating and long term more than  months from the date of rating   buy more than  appreciation   accumulate  appreciation   neutral between  depreciation and  appreciation   reduce  depreciation and   sell more than  depreciation although some of merrill lynchs research reports disclosed the stock appreciation percentages associated with the intermediate and longterm ratings none of the research reports discussed below contained such disclosure  during the relevant period merrill lynchs published ratings had four elements i a risk rating from a low risk through d high risk ii a rating for the intermediate term iii a rating for the long term and iv a dividend rating with respect to each of the research reports discussed below merrill lynch rated each company d high risk  some of merrill lynchs research reports also assigned to the stock a price target which was intended to reflect the price at which the analyst believed the stock would trade within the next twelve months or on occasion within a longer period of time ii research analysts were subjected to conflicts of interest  in the manner described below merrill lynch investment bankers unduly influenced research analysts thereby creating conflicts of interest for the research analysts merrill lynch failed to manage these conflicts in an adequate or appropriate manner a merrill lynch research analysts assisted investment banking  merrill lynchs research department provided a service function within the firm and was not an independent profit center merrill lynch funded its research department through firm revenues received from a number of businesses at the firm including investment banking merrill lynchs investment banking department generated substantial revenues for merrill lynch merrill lynch encouraged its research analysts to assist investment banking activities merrill lynch expected research analysts to vet initial public offerings review and opine on other prospective investment banking deals attend pitch sessions with investment bankers in which the bankers competed for the issuers investment banking business and talk with institutional investors about those issuers when the internet research group could not support favorable research ratings it vetoed the investment banking deals  merrill lynchs investment banking group used the internet research groups ratings and coverage to support its business  in march  within weeks of joining merrill lynch blodget circulated to research management and senior investment bankers an email entitled managing the banking calendar for internet research in that email blodget stated we are now up to  internet banking transactions in the pipeline     the current schedule for this week    is  banking  research     blodget estimated that his team would devote the majority of its time that week to assisting in investment banking efforts and cautioned that if he failed to allocate at least  of his time and the overall research teams time to performing research and institutional marketing then his and his teams reputation among institutional investors might suffer  if merrill lynch secured the mandate the internet sector analysts sometimes helped market investment banking deals to institutional investors by attending roadshows during roadshows the issuers management and merrill lynch investment bankers solicited interest in the offering from institutional investors internet sector analysts also attended nondeal roadshows for existing clients to promote interest in their companys stock as a senior intermediate internet group analyst stated to blodget among others in a may   email we are taking infospace    on a nondeal roadshow to introduce the new ceo this company is very important to us from a banking perspective in addition to our institutional franchise    these nondeal roadshows are very important in my view in that they    have tremendous halo effect on our banking efforts  during the relevant period merrill lynchs internet research group assigned consistently positive intermediate and longterm ratings on the internet stocks it covered during the relevant period the overwhelming majority of stocks covered by merrill lynchs internet research group had a  buy or a  accumulate rating merrill lynch infrequently used a  neutral rating as a junior analyst explained to the management of an investment banking client in september  merrill lynchs ratings range from  but we dont cover anything below a   in a june  email a senior intermediate analyst wrote to blodget in connection with a company on which merrill lynch was then planning to but ultimately did not initiate coverage i am personally afraid of the impact we will have on the stock if we do a  so am leaning towards a  which is still our lowest rating b the existing or potential investment banking relationship factored into the decision to initiate research coverage  whether merrill lynch had or wanted investment banking business from a company was a factor in the decision to initiate research coverage on that company and in the instance described below an important factor while blodget headed the internet group merrill lynch initiated coverage predominantly on existing or prospective investment banking clients blodget noted that the selection of a company for research coverage was based on the companys status in the industry the number of shareholders the long term prognosis andor a banking relationship  in an april  email a merrill lynch investment banker asked do you think we should aggressively link coverage with banking  that is what we did with gonet henry blodget was involved      in a july  email a junior analyst in the internet group observed we listened to gotonet call last night  investors didnt like weakish traffic and ad growth i dont understand what makes biz model tick they beat estimates in part due to decreased share count increased interest income and a low tax rate     i imagine we will pick it up if there is some banking revenue attached merrill lynch did not in fact initiate research coverage on gonet in october  gonet was sold to infospace a company on which merrill lynch provided research coverage and merrill lynch provided advisory services to gonet between july and october  in connection with the sale c certain prospective ratings and research reports with ratings were shared with investment bankers and issuers  merrill lynch did not prohibit all interaction between research and investment banking rather its internal policies prohibited the dissemination of ratings and research reports with ratings to investment bankers and to issuers prior to publication the merrill lynch policies and procedures manual in effect during  to  imposed the following restrictions on pending research pending initial opinions estimate or opinion changes and decisions to issue research reports or comments may not be disclosed by any means to anyone either inside or outside the firm until the information is disseminated in the appropriately prescribed manner exceptions are limited to certain merrill lynch personnel and under limited circumstances management of the subject company this prohibition is intended to avoid the misuse of marketsensitive information and the appearance of impropriety certain of the exceptions referenced in the quotation above allowed investment bankers and company management to review unpublished research reports to verify factual accuracy or after the market closed but before publication of the research none of the instances cited herein however qualified for any of the exceptions listed in merrill lynchs policies and procedures manual  in the instances described below merrill lynchs research analysts violated such policies by disseminating research reports with ratings to investment bankers and issuers prior to their publication merrill lynch did not adequately monitor research analysts communications to detect and prevent such dissemination  sharing unpublished ratings with investment bankers  in august  a junior analyst in the internet group sent the following email to a merrill lynch research manager and blodget the following chart lays out henrys henry blodgets universe and the ratings we would like to change i have spoken to the merrill lynch investment banker    on this    as these are all bc namesand he is fine with it  in an email dated november   blodget gave the following advance notice to a merrill lynch investment banker based on what im hearing we will probably be taking cmgi to at least a  after they report guidance monday night two days later on november   merrill lynch through blodget in fact downgraded cmgi from a  to a   sharing unpublished reports and ratings with covered companies  prior to initiating research coverage on gotocom inc goto discussed in greater detail below a research analyst shared the prospective rating with both investment bankers and the company on november  prior to initiating coverage of goto a junior internet research analyst emailed blodget to report goto has gotten back to me and says they are comfortable with the discussions we had with them and with coming out with a  rating etc given that we would be downgrading look at the same time so the ratings are the same  in an email dated july   from blodget to the junior analyst blodget stated some of the communication with the goto people and the bankers prior to the initiation may have been a technical violation of the firms written policies and procedures which i have now learned say the companybankers should not be told what the proposed rating is or will be even if the company isnt currently under coverage      as the date for initiating coverage of goto drew closer the same junior analyst emailed the investment bankers research mgmnt   wants to go with a  on goto  another merrill lynch analyst who was not in the internet group also shared unpublished research reports with his covered company  tyco international ltd tyco in a february   email from the analyst to the tyco cfo the analyst attached an unpublished research report and stated please review asap i will not send it out until i hear from you first loyal tyco employee that same day the analyst sent an email to another tyco investor relations employee attaching the same draft research report and stated i wanted to get this out asap     please review and comment d research analysts contributions to investment banking factored into their performance evaluations and compensation  investment banking revenues generated in an analysts sector were a factor in evaluating that analysts performance and consequently in determining that analysts compensation in november  merrill lynchs research management requested that all equity analysts submit a report detailing their contributions to investment banking during the year and highlighting instances where their research coverage played a role in originating and securing an underwriting mandate or advisory work on mergers and acquisitions blodgets email response highlighted his internet groups involvement in over  completed or potential investment banking transactions and included among his teams activities pitching the client marketing the offering and providing research coverage for future banking blodget estimated that from december  to november  the internet research group was involved in activities relating to investment banking deals that produced approximately  million of revenue for merrill lynch e research analysts were subjected to pressure from investment bankers  merrill lynch research management acknowledged the problem of investment banking influence over research analysts in the following october  email to blodget wireless internet ratings major issue    i would like to discuss this topic with you directly to gather facts about this issue over the last year i then need to have a philosophical discussion with other research managers about this i think we are off base on how we rate stocks and how much we bend backwards to accommodate banking etc breaking the link between writing and rating is a partial solution but i think the issue is much deeper  in november  the merrill lynch senior analyst who covered aether a wireless internet company with blodget circulated an email to a research manager copied to other research managers and blodget entitled mobile internet reducing intermediate term rating to accumulate maintaining long term buy in that email the analyst attached a draft note that announced the simultaneous downgrade of aether infospace and openwave from  to  and outlined the following four choices first we can downgrade to  and go out with the draft report below     second we can keep aether at a     and downgrade openwave and infospace for the reasons cited people would invariably ask the question why arent we downgrading aether third we can downgrade openwave and infospace and say nothing about aether fourth we can keep them all at s    i sound flip but i am not being so  if banking is our top concern id just like us all to agree on it  this email prompted research management to conduct a meeting among research management the analyst who wrote the email the merrill lynch investment bankers who managed the aether relationship and blodget during that call investment bankers argued against the proposed downgrade and urged the analyst to meet with aether management shortly thereafter research management the senior analyst and blodget met with aether management who argued against the downgrade instead of downgrading aether in december  merrill lynch published separate research reports maintaining a  rating on aether and downgrading openwave and infospace  shortly thereafter blodget emailed the investment bankers who managed the aether relationship and copied the senior analyst for aether and another internet group analyst the more i read of these the less willing i am to cut companies any slack regardless of the predictable tempertantrums threats andor relationship damage that are likely to follow    if there is no new email forthcoming from research management on how to apply ratings to sensitive banking clientssituations we are going to just start calling the stocks stocks not companies including aether like we see them no matter what the ancillary business consequences are iii merrill lynch published research on goto and infospace that violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws  as described below certain of merrill lynchs research reports for goto and infospace inc infospace expressed views that were contrary to the analysts privately expressed negative views of the stocks and did not disclose those negative views thereby making those reports fraudulent a goto  goto now known as overture services inc is an internet advertising services company that introduces consumers and businesses that search the internet to advertisers who provide products services and information in september  merrill lynch pursued and secured a mandate for a private placement of gotos european subsidiary in connection with that mandate merrill lynch initiated research coverage on goto  initiation of coverage on goto  the initial research report on goto was published in january  and expressed views contrary to the privately expressed negative views of blodget and his fellow analysts during the period november  to january  on november   a junior analyst emailed blodget and stated another firm initiated on gotocom with a buy    i guess they are angling for the ma mergers and acquisitions business too  the next day while working on the initiation of coverage report blodget emailed a junior analyst and queried what is your honest take on the stock no reason to own it    or going a lot lower in my humble opinion i think the first rating should be a     the second a  later that day the junior analyst responded    i think both  no reason to own now    totally could go lower who are we trying to please by doing a   i dont want to be a whore for fing mgmnt if  means that we are putting half of merrill retail into this stock because they are out accumulating it then i dont think thats the right thing to do we are losing people money and i dont like it hypothetical retail clients john and mary smith are losing their retirement because we dont want gotos cfo to be mad at us merrill lynchs investment banking relationship manager for goto said he is fine with a  i said to him the whole idea that we are independent from banking is a big lie  without banking this would be a  and he said noyou guys are independent you can do what you want  im fine with that i would put it back to the company to convince you that there is a reason you should own this at x year  earnings per share   so thats my feeling     on january   the junior analyst emailed the investment bankers research mgmnt  wants to go with a  on goto ratings on initiation of coverage were approved by research management and research compliance one of the bankers responded to blodget and the junior analyst briefly in talking to research compliance yesterday i thought the strategy was to go out with the  as soon as the stock hit  if it doesnt i dont think anybody has an interest in seeing initiation at a  blodget replied to the bankers my concern is that waiting for  is waiting for godot    the reference here was to the samuel beckett play waiting for godot in that play the central story line involves two characters who continuously wait for the arrival of an individual named godot he never comes  during the following week goto traded intraday above  and on january   merrill lynch initiated coverage on goto at a  neutralbuy the same rating reflected in the email from investment banking merrill lynchs initiation piece reported that goto has a payforperformance model which should help it gain share in the current environment    it is growing quickly and probably has enough cash to make it to breakeven estimated in q     given the current weak environment for online advertising we do not see any near term catalysts we expect the market to improve in h  however and we believe that goto will be a survivor  on the same day merrill lynch initiated coverage an institutional client emailed blodget to ask whats so interesting about goto except banking fees blodget replied nothin  the initial research report on goto expressed views contrary to the research analysts privately expressed negative views as described above and did not disclose those contrary views including blodgets belief that goto was interesting only for the banking fees it could generate as a result the january  research report was fraudulent  subsequent research on goto  on april   merrill lynch upgraded goto from  to  accumulatebuy based on gotos very strong first quarter results and merrill lynchs observation that goto had executed extremely well in a tough environment the upgrade set a price objective of  from gotos then current trading price of   on may   goto closed at  in a may   email an institutional client asked blodget for buy recommendations that were compelling currently blodget responded i would have said goto and homs but both have had very strong runs and are overdone in my opinion  on may  and   when goto closed at  and  respectively merrill lynch issued additional research reports that reiterated gotos  rating and stated we believe a few stocks are attractive    we are recommending    goto    these research reports expressed views contrary to the views privately expressed by blodget in his may  email and did not disclose blodgets view that the stock price was overdone  in midmay  merrill lynchs investment bankers pitched to goto the idea of doing a secondary equity offering underwritten by merrill lynch and set a may  meeting date to discuss this possibility however on may  gotos ceo and cfo advised a merrill lynch investment banker that goto was leaning toward selecting a firm other than merrill lynch to do the underwriting work that same day in an internal email a merrill lynch investment banker remarked i was very dismayed to learn that goto was leaning toward another firm as the lead bookrunning manager particularly given the tremendous effort we have put forth on the companys behalf not only did henry blodget initiate on the stock when it was flirting with penny stock status but he recently upgraded it and sponsored a set of meetings for management in new york which dramatically moved the stock price    we have the  ranked internet research analyst in henry blodget      a few hours later a research analyst emailed to blodget draft downgrade bullets for goto h i dont think ive downgraded a stock on valuation since the mids anyway i threw together these bullets in a note on my hard drive so that we are ready to pull the trigger quickly do you think we need more than bullets i didnt think so since this downgrade would be based solely on valuation let me know  the downgrade bullets explained that goto has doubled since our upgrade about a month ago we are downgrading the stock due to valuation     we believe it is prudent to take some money off the table  blodgets immediate email response was beautiful fuk sic em  while merrill lynchs may  and may  research reports maintained gotos  rating and recommended goto as attractive the research analysts may  email stated an intention to downgrade goto based on valuation concerns  meaning that they viewed the stock as expensive gotos stock price however remained relatively constant from may  to may   in fact on may  and may  when merrill lynch issued research reports recommending the stock goto closed at  and  respectively and on may  the date of the email goto closed at

has sold over mm shares before their quarterly earnings are we planning a secondary for the stock  later that day blodget forwarded the email to a senior intermediate analyst complaining ugh im getting killed on this thing two days later on july   blodget emailed the same research analyst and stated i dont mean to be a pain on this one but this stock is a powder keg given how aggressive we were on it earlier this year and given the bad smell comments that so many institutions are bringing up    later that day the analyst replied fair point but heres how i look at it i still believe in the story longterm and secondly we addressed the issues without crushing the stock which we would have done and angered everyone also it is not as smelly as the hedgies say  theyre just looking for a short  the following day july   infospaces chairman emailed the same research analyst to confide that infospace was contemplating an investment in the company us search the research analyst advised him as follows we need to talk about this    i am concerned the market will not react favorably to any news that infospace funds us search my best advice to you is to let your competitors win this one  there will be plenty of deals for you to do and infospace cannot afford this kind of scrutiny right now  the stock is under a lot of pressure  on or about october  another senior analyst assumed coverage of infospace but blodget continued to participate in the research process and his name continued to appear on the research reports beneath the name of the senior analyst on the morning of

news service article stating that infospace had published a handwritten annual report in a high school exam format blodget immediately forwarded the email to the senior analyst for infospace and said i am so tired of getting these can we please reset this infospace stupid price target and rip this piece of junk off whatever list its on if you have to downgrade it downgrade it  that same morning the financial consultant sent another email to blodget explaining that he had read infospaces  annual report and that he believed it was not as bad as the newspaper article had indicated again that

double digit ebitda margins in h     athm might be on the right track but neverending state of flux makes forecasting and investing difficult pieces of the company remain attractive for acquisition but we believe the value as a consolidated operating business continues to decline if indeed the company is able to turn ebitda positive and hit the doubledigit margin targets in the back half of the
