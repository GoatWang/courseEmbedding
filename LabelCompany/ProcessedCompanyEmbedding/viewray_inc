nasdaqvray a medtech company focused on improving cancer treatment are getting beaten up after a lessthanthrilling earnings report was released after the bell yesterday as of  pm edt the stock was  lower than its previous close so what viewray incs fancy mriguided radiationtherapy delivery systems arent cheap this year the company expects to generate between  million and  million in total revenue mainly from the sale of seven or eight mridian linac systems image source getty images if viewray can book that revenue this year it would be a tremendous launch for the system which just received fda clearance in february unfortunately investors will have to be a bit more patient the company didnt book any product revenue during the first quarter and doesnt expect to do so until the second half of the year now what the good news is that viewrays  million backlog at the end of this march was  higher than the backlog it reported at the same time last year the company also has a larger cash cushion after completing some valuediluting share offerings recently so far this year patient investors have watched viewrays share count rise about  but the company also finished the quarter with  million in cash and cash equivalents operations lost  million in the first quarter which means the company might not require another trip to the equity tap in the foreseeable future provided it can deliver on its backlog in a timely manner cory renauer has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has a

offering will be approximately  million at an assumed initial public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately  million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us each  increase decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus would increase decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately  million assuming that the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us we may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering an increase decrease of  in the number of shares we are offering would increase decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately  million assuming the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discount we currently intend to use our existing cash and the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering as follows  approximately  to  million to support the ongoing commercialization of mridian including sales and marketing activities manufacturing and supply chain management installation customer support and product quality and  approximately  to  million to fund research and development capital and expenses related to continued product development activities and  the remainder for general corporate purposes including working capital we do not expect that a change in the offering price or the number of shares by these amounts would have a material effect on our intended uses of the net proceeds from this offering although it may impact the amount of time prior to which we may need to seek additional capital we believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions or inlicenses of complementary companies or technologies while we have no current agreements commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions or inlicenses at this time we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering the amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors including  personnel costs to support our product development and commercialization efforts  the outcomes of our research and development efforts  the timing of regulatory approvals for mridian in foreign countries and  our operations as a public company pending the use of the proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in shortterm interestbearing investmentgrade securities certificates of deposit or government securities we compete directly with companies marketing igrt devices for the treatment of cancer using ct ultrasound optical tracking and xray imaging we also compete with companies developing nextgeneration igrt devices specifically those developing mriguided devices amongst others we expect technological advances including the ability to provide realtime imaging clinical outcomes size price operational complexity and operational efficiency to drive competitive market dynamics our major competitors with devices approved for distribution in the united states or globally include varian medical systems inc or varian elekta ab or elekta and accuray incorporated many of our direct competitors have greater financial sales and marketing service infrastructure and research and development capabilities than we do as well as more established reputations and current market share the main limitations of currently approved devices are the lack of realtime clear images before and during the treatment as well as the ability to perform ontable adaptive planning we are also aware of two commercial and two academic ongoing research efforts to develop radiation therapy systems incorporating mri elekta and royal philips have formed a consortium to develop the elektaphilips mrilinac and varian is working with imris on a multiroom configuration combining imris’s mr imaging technology with varian’s truebeam radiation system the university of sydney ingham institute and the university of queensland have formed a partnership to develop an mrilinac and the university of alberta’s cross cancer institute is working on an mrilinac as well although these academic research efforts may not compete directly with us commercially if one of our competitors were to form a partnership with one of these institutions to commercialize their system it could impact our sales negatively of these four we believe the elekta philips mrilinac is the most advanced in development although we believe this system is still years away from approval mridian is the first and only commercially available mriguided radiation therapy device to image and treat cancer patients simultaneously the limited capital expenditure budgets of our customers results in all suppliers to these entities competing for a limited pool of funds our customers may be required to select between two items of capital equipment for example some of our potential customers are considering expensive proton therapy systems which could consume a significant portion of their capital expenditure budgets company description we design manufacture and market mridian the first and only mriguided radiation therapy system that images and treats cancer patients simultaneously magnetic resonance imaging or mri is a broadly used imaging tool which has the ability to differentiate between types of soft tissue clearly unlike xray or computed tomography or ct which are the most commonly used imaging technologies in radiation therapy today mridian integrates mri technology radiation delivery and our proprietary software to locate target and track the position and shape of softtissue tumors while radiation is delivered these capabilities allow mridian to deliver radiation to the tumor accurately while delivering less radiation to healthy tissue than existing radiation therapy treatments we believe this leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects from offtarget radiation delivery physicians have used mridian to treat a broad spectrum of radiation therapy patients with more than  different types of cancer as well as patients for whom radiation therapy was previously not an option we received k marketing clearance from the us food and drug administration or fda for mridian in may  and received permission to affix the ce mark in november  patients are actively receiving treatment on mridian systems at three cancer centers located at washington university in stlouis university of california los angeles and the university of wisconsin– madison we generated revenue of  million in  and  million in  and had net losses of  million in  and  million in  at december   we had  signed sales contracts for mridian systems in backlog with a total value of  million of which we expect to recognize approximately  to  as revenue in  representing four to six mridian systems the determination of backlog includes objective and subjective judgment about the likelihood of an order becoming revenue we evaluate our backlog at least quarterly to determine if the orders continue to meet our criteria for inclusion in backlog our judgment and evaluation may be incorrect and orders may be delayed or cancelled for reasons beyond our control projects included in backlog may be removed if we determine the particular order no longer constitutes a valid order we cannot assure you that our backlog will result in revenue on a timely basis or at all or that any cancelled contracts will be replaced accordingly our backlog is an uncertain indicator of our future earnings cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide accounting for over eight million deaths per year globally radiation therapy is a common method used to treat cancer that uses lethal doses of ionizing energy to damage the genetic material in cells nearly twothirds of all cancer patients in the united states will receive some form of radiation therapy during the course of their illness according to estimates by the american society for radiation oncology in  imv medical information division inc reported that  of patients receiving radiation therapy in the united states were treated by an externalbeam radiation therapy device called a linear accelerator or linac the global linac market was  billion in  and was expected to grow to  billion by  according to a  markets and markets report iaea human health campus reports that there are over  linacs installed at over  centers worldwide we believe the addressable market for mridian is the annual market for linacs due to its ability to treat a broad spectrum of disease sites however we believe that mridian may be used more frequently for complex cancer cases that may be difficult to treat on a standard linac due to the location of the tumor in relation to the surrounding soft tissues we currently estimate the annual market for linacs to be  units per year globally the majority of which are replacement units  we
