applicant in the auctions and acquire the licenses at a small business discount the whistleblower actually was an attorney who once worked in the telecommuncations business for licts competitor adelphia which went bankrupt these parties were not sued by the government or private plaintiffs the lawsuit allegations claim gabelli by virtue of his role in publicly traded lict corp was fraudulent because gabelli had de facto control over the companies and had aggregate assets that far exceeded the ceiling of the small business criteria which would disqualify an applicant from the small business discount auctions supposedly many other participants both individuals as well as corporations in the wireless auctions totally unrelated to gabelli also set up business arrangements to take advantage of the small business discount and succeeded even though in reality they too could not pass the small business criteria the government stood on the sideline and did not take up the suit for the american public indeed licts fcc attorney stated that gabelli complied with fcc requirements the suit had alleged that the gabellibacked false entrepreneurs included an nba playera related party a

worked in the telecommuncations business for licts competitor adelphia which went bankrupt these parties were not sued by the government or private plaintiffs the lawsuit allegations claim gabelli by virtue of his role in publicly traded lict corp was fraudulent because gabelli had de facto control over the companies and had aggregate assets that far exceeded the ceiling of the small business criteria which would disqualify an applicant from the small business discount auctions supposedly many other participants both individuals as well as corporations in the wireless auctions totally unrelated to gabelli also set up business arrangements to take advantage of the small business discount and succeeded even though in reality they too could not pass the small business criteria the government stood on the sideline and did not take up the suit for the american public indeed licts fcc attorney stated that gabelli complied with fcc requirements the suit had alleged that the

pm seth wenigreutersmario gabelli the chief of gamco investors in  mario j gabelli is more likely to be listed among the united states’ bestknown money managers than among its highest paid chief executives but that is not because he does not qualify for both lists he does mr gabelli belongs on a short list of chief executives of public companies who have earned more than  million in total compensation that’s right more than threequarters of a billion dollars but there will probably not be any uproar from the shareholders of gamco investors at the company’s annual meeting next week at a yacht club in greenwich conn one reason is that mr gabelli controls gamco an investment firm based in rye ny because he owns almost all of its class b shares on thursday the company announced a plan to share some of its success with those less fortunate by pledging to donate  cents a share to charities designated by each shareholder gamco said the contributions could exceed  million — no small sum unless you compare it with how much mr gabelli has been making last year alone he was paid almost  million as the chairman and chief executive of gamco but that was not his best year he took home almost  million in  and in  he received a  million payout that increased the amount he collected that year to  million all told since he took his company public in early  mr gabelli has been paid nearly  million an average of  million a year most years a few other chief executives have reaped more than mr gabelli but even fewer if any have received so much year in and year out for so long his recipe for riches has been a compensation arrangement that resembles that of a hedge fund manager he collects no base salary or bonus but takes  percent of the company’s pretax profits as well as fees for attracting investors and managing funds the company declined to discuss mr gabelli’s compensation now  mr gabelli has not indicated that he is contemplating an exit strategy though the shareholders will decide next week whether to consider reclassifying his shares the proposal in the proxy statement suggests each of his  million shares might be converted into  shares of class a stock giving him close to  percent of all the outstanding shares and making it easier for him to pare his holdings at the current share price of about  his stake is worth more than  billion whats next

worked in the telecommuncations business for licts competitor adelphia which went bankrupt these parties were not sued by the government or private plaintiffs the lawsuit allegations claim gabelli by virtue of his role in publicly traded lict corp was fraudulent because gabelli had de facto control over the companies and had aggregate assets that far exceeded the ceiling of the small business criteria which would disqualify an applicant from the small business discount auctions supposedly many other participants both individuals as well as corporations in the wireless auctions totally unrelated to gabelli also set up business arrangements to take advantage of the small business discount and succeeded even though in reality they too could not pass the small business criteria the government stood on the sideline and did not take up the suit for the american public indeed licts fcc attorney stated that gabelli complied with fcc requirements the suit had alleged that the

sham startup companies to meet the requirements of a small business applicant in the auctions and acquire the licenses at a small business discount the whistleblower actually was an attorney who once worked in the telecommuncations business for licts competitor adelphia which went bankrupt these parties were not sued by the government or private plaintiffs the lawsuit allegations claim gabelli by virtue of his role in publicly traded lict corp was fraudulent because gabelli had de facto control over the companies and had aggregate assets that far exceeded the ceiling of the small business criteria which would disqualify an applicant from the small business discount auctions supposedly many other participants both individuals as well as corporations in the wireless auctions totally unrelated to gabelli also set up business arrangements to take advantage of the small business discount and succeeded even though in reality they too could not pass the small business criteria the government stood on the sideline and did not take up the suit for the american public indeed licts fcc attorney stated that gabelli complied with fcc requirements the suit had alleged that the

worked in the telecommuncations business for licts competitor adelphia which went bankrupt these parties were not sued by the government or private plaintiffs the lawsuit allegations claim gabelli by virtue of his role in publicly traded lict corp was fraudulent because gabelli had de facto control over the companies and had aggregate assets that far exceeded the ceiling of the small business criteria which would disqualify an applicant from the small business discount auctions supposedly many other participants both individuals as well as corporations in the wireless auctions totally

fraudulent practices in fcc auctions between  and  in those auctions the government set aside cell phone licenses to be sold to small businesses taylors lawsuit said that gabelli used more than twelve sham startup companies to meet the requirements of a small business applicant in the auctions and acquire the licenses at a small business discount the whistleblower actually was an attorney who once worked in the telecommuncations business for licts competitor adelphia which went bankrupt these parties were not sued by the government or private plaintiffs the lawsuit allegations claim gabelli by virtue of his role in publicly traded lict corp was fraudulent because gabelli had de facto control over the companies and had aggregate assets that far exceeded the ceiling of the small business criteria which would disqualify an applicant from the small business discount auctions supposedly many other participants both individuals as well as corporations in the wireless auctions totally unrelated to gabelli also set up business arrangements to take advantage of the small business discount and succeeded even though in reality they too could not pass the small business criteria the government stood on the sideline and did not take up the suit for the american public indeed licts fcc attorney stated that gabelli complied with fcc requirements the suit had alleged that the gabellibacked false entrepreneurs included an nba playera related party a former partner of an accounting firm an aerobics instructor and even the caretaker of a vacation home in part owned by gabelli on july   the suit was settled when the bidding entities reportedly agreed to pay  million to settle the allegations gabellis money management business gamco investors inc was not a party to the lawsuit neither gabelli nor his companies nor any of the other parties were charged the government did not pursue any other wireless auction participants in the small business discount area lict and
