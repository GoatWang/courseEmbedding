the fund attempts to exploit this failure on behalf of our investors through a bottomup fundamental investment approach fund management matthew mclennan cfa portfolio manager industry experience  yrs kimball brooker jr portfolio manager industry experience  yrs investment process the fundamental research process has remained constant since the inception of the fund the fund looks for opportunities in companies that have temporarily disappointed investors industries in turmoil or out of favor and countries in economic downturns or overlooked by the market the investment process involves the following steps  analyze understand business models thoroughly understand a company and the market in which it operates among other critical factors the teams documentdriven analysis examines a companys market share the nature of its products and its business contingencies  recast financial statements financial statements are recast because conservative accounting practices can mask the true earnings power of a company in our view accounting practices are sometimes too liberal our goal is to uncover a companys true economic earnings using only demonstrated results  calculate intrinsic value the team places great emphasis on balance sheet valuation such as enterprise value to asset replacement value cash flow valuation such as evebit investments are made based on significant discounts to what is believed to be a companys intrinsic value  typically invest for the long term the team typically seeks a discount to what they believe is a companys intrinsic value they seek further protection by determining a margin of safety in each holding this margin of safety is viewed as a form of protection against uncertainty in a fundamentally unknowable future the global fund may also invest in nonequity securities in an attempt to help preserve purchasing power these include gold bullion corporate bonds senior or subordinated bonds convertible bonds cash and cash
