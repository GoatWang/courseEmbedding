they all form at high temperatures magma eventually cools to from igneous rocks composed of interlocking crystals the mineral crystals do not usually have any permanent alignment intrusivehypabyssal or plutonic igneous rocks these have medium crystal sizes if the magma cooled fairly slow at intermediate depths for example dolerite or coarse crystal sizes if the magma cooled slowly at great depths within the earths crust for example granite the minerals are hard silicates such as quartz and feldspar and separate mineral crystals can be seen in the rocks extrusivevolcanic igneous rocks these have fine crystals size as the magma reached the earths surface and cooled quickly such as basalt or pumicecrystal grain sizes the easiest way to classify an igneous rock is through its crystal grain size the grain size can tell us a great deal about the cooling history of the rock and links to its origin igneous rocks are divided on the basis of average crystal size this means ignoring all the very large crystals called phenocrysts if no crystals can be seen even with a hand lens then the rock has a glassy texture and it cooled too quickly for any crystals to form fine crystals are less than mm so that individual crystals can not be identified by eye medium grained crystals are mm and can be seen by eye  coarse gained crystals are greater than mm in size and can be seen and identified by eyesilica  chemical analysis gives the overall chemical composition of a rock rather than which mineral are present the majority of sio in igneous rocks is not present as quartz sio silicasilicon dioxide but is contained within other silicates minerals such as olive and feldspar its is easier to link sio percentage to the colour as a short cut for identification the mafic rocks are rich in dark coloured ferromagnesian minerals such as olivine and augite silicic rocks are rich in light coloured minerals such as quartz and feldspar but colour can be misleading as in rock such as obsidian which is dark coloured however is silicicfelsic minerals silicicthe felsic minerals are quartz and feldspar which are bother rich in silicaquartz silicic only found in silicic or

structure with glass on the outside and fine crystals inside where cooling is rapid there may be no time for crystals to form obsidian cools in this way it looks black because light will not pass

or even meters long pegmatites form in the last stages of crystallisation from the water rich residue magma the pegmatite crystals are usually quartz k feldspar and muscovite grow in a supersaturated solution pegmatite can produce large crystals in a short geological time periodequigranularmeans that all the crystals are of equal size but may all be fine medium or coarse the grain size is relevant to the time spent cooling so the longer cooling time the large the crystal fine grained crystals will have been formed rapidly at the surface are extruded medium grained crystal formed by slow cooling below the surface at hypabyssal which is sallow depths in the crust no more than kmcoarse grained crystal will have been formed very slowly at deep depths below the surface know as plutonichowever an intrusion that cooled km below the surface will have medium grained crystals but will also have fine grained crystals at the edge were the chilled margin cooled quickly a lava flow that cooled at the surface will have fine grained crystals but if it is very thick then the middle of the flow may have medium grained crystalsvesicular vesicular textures are where gas bubbles are trapped in the lava as it cools rapidly leaving holes where the gas was  the holes are called vesicles are usually oval in shape and are also elongated parallel in the direction of flow  the gas rises so most vesicles are found at the top of a lava flow or sometimes at the edge of an intrusion is commonly found in basalt and pumiceamygdaloidal the amygdaloidal texture is formed when the holes are later infilled by minerals deposited by the ground water is porous which allows water to flow through it  the ground water contains calcium carbonate so calcite will be precipitated in the holes this can happen over millions of years after the minerals was formed is mainly either calcite or quartz however others may also be found each infilled hole is called an amygdale both are around mm however can be largerflow bandingflow banding occurs where layers of darkmafic biotite and light silicic quartz minerals form due to the separation of minerals within in silicic lava flows they will be aligned parallel to the flow direction though they may often be contortedtwisted out of normal shapebecause the lava flow was vicious so flowed slowly often found in rhyoliteporphyritic textures a porphyritic texture forms when there is two stages of cooling to a rocks formation resulting in two different crystal sizes  the large crystals are called phenocrysts and form first by cooling slowly they are surrounded by a finer groundmass which cooled quickly the texture can be found in any igneous rock but is most common in porphyritic basalt and porphyritic granite even though they cooled at different depths  in porphyritic basalt the phenocrysts often plagioclase feldspar start to form slowly in the magma chamber below the volcano when the eruption occurs magma and plagioclase crystals are erupted to the surface where rapid cooling occurs and forms the fine grained crystals of the ground mass  the phenocrysts in a porphyritic granite often potassium feldspar start to form at very slowly at great depths perhaps  km the magma and feldspar crystals move up within the crusts to form a batholith the rest of the magma then cools very slowly to form the coarse grained crystals of the

mantle rock just mk below partial melting of ultramafic peridotite from the upper mantle produces mafic magmasdivergent plateis where two plates are moving apart and magma is rising between thempartical meltingoccurs where some of the minerals in a rock melt to form a magmamafic magma at hotspots a similar process occurs at hotspots where mantle plumes rise from deep in the mantle and results in partial melting of mafic material convection in the mantle slowly transports heat from the core to earths surface mantle plumes carry the heat upwards in a narrow rising column of hot material which spreads out when the plume reaches the rigid lithosphere  at this shallow lower pressures allow particle melting of the mantle peridotite to form large amounts of basaltic magma that may erupt not the surface if the plume provides a continuous supply of magma in a fixed location it from a hot spot as the lithosphere moves over this fixed hotspot due to plate tectonics the eruption of magma on to the surface forms a chain of islands parallel to to the movement of the platessilicic lava formation at convergent plate marginscontinental  continental  where to continents move together and converge neither continent will subduct however the high pressures and weight of sediments which ave been deformed to form fold mountains combine to form the base of the crust downwards as a result the moho is at its deepest below the highest fold mountains particle melting at the base of the continental crust will produce silicic magma as the continental crust is silicic and starts to melt at  degrees this is the temperature below the mountains due to the geothermal gradient as the magma rises it intrudes to form granite batholiths there are no volcanoes as the magma is to viscous to make it to the surfaceintermediate lava formation at convergent plate boundariescontinental  oceanic  where plates converge and the oceanic plate subduct due to it higher density of gcm particle melting occur and produce magma if the plate subduct and the magma rises quickly then at shallow depths then it will basaltic often the magma will rise through the silicic continental crust which may cause particle melting the rising temperatures may be at temperatures greater than  degrees and silicic material melts at just  this results in the mixing of silicic and mafic melts to give an intermediate magma the two components have different viscosities so mixing is difficult some of the magma will reach the surface to form intermediate volcanoes however most will be intruded to form granite batholithsbowens reactivity series magma is the mixture of magma melted and mixed together with volatiles and water the initial composition of the magma may be silicic or mafic but the concept of differentiation shows how different rocks can be produced from a single magma the results of bowens experiment give us the the order in which minerals crystallise in a magmathe discontinuous series the left hand side of the diagram is called the discontinuous series all these minerals are mafic and rich in iron and magnesiums with silica in a mafic magma olivine be the first mafic mineral to form at high temperatures greater than  as the temperature decreases  pyroxeneaugite then amphibole hornblende and finally biotite if cooling takes place slowly then the early formed high temperature minerals react with the magma to form the next mineral down the series for example olivine reacts with magma to form pyroxene if there is enough silica present if the magma is cooled quickly when it is erupted into a volcano then the reaction will not have time to occur and olivine will be persevered often the reaction of one mineral with the next will be incomplete and the reaction rim will be seen around the crystalscontinous series the right hand side of the diagram is the continuous series showing the crystallisation of plagioclase feldspar plagioclase is calcium ca rich at high temperatures and sodium na rich at low temperatures with intermediate composition of  calcium and   sodium at temperatures in between plagioclase is continuously reacting with the liquids to form a more na rich crystal as the temperature decreases sometimes individual crystals of plagioclase show zoning the centre of the crystal being ca rich whilst the towards the edge it is more na rich plagioclase and poorer in caplagioclase feldspar knowing that ca rich plagioclase is only found in mafic and ultra mafic rocks whilst na rich plagioclase is found in silicic and intermediate rock means that they can be used in the classification of ingenious rockslow temperature minerals when the two reaction series converge at a low temperature minerals remain which will not react with the liquid the final group of minerals to crystallise are the felsic minerals which are silicic rich these are potassium feldspar followed by muscovite mica and finally quartz at a temperature of about  cimportance of bowens reactivity mafic rocks form at high temperatures as they contain olivine pyroxene and ca rich plagioclase silicic rocks form at low temperatures as they contain quartzmuscovite k feldspar na rich plagioclase and some biotite the minerals that form at lower temperatures at the end of the reactivity series are most stable at earths surface because they are formed closest to low temperature surface environment as a results the most common mineral in sedimentary rocks in quartz the high temperature minerals are most unstable and quickest to weather at the surfacemagmatic differentiation is a number of processes that cause a magma to evolve into magmas of different compositions this leads to different igneous rocks being produced from a single parent magma a mafic magma may crystallise to form ultramafic mafic intermediate or even silicic rocksfractional cristallisation as olivine and pyroxene form at high temperatures they use the iron and magnesium from the magma  the high temperature plagioclase crystals ate rich in calcium this results in the magma becoming depleted in ironmagnesium and calcium the remaining liquid is enriched in silica potassium sodium and water because the early formed minerals are poor in these elements overtime the composition of the magma changes from the originalgravity settling generally crystals will be denser than the liquid in which they are suspended so will settle out early formed minerals with a higher density than the surrounding liquid such as olivine sink to the bottom to form a layer at the base of the intrusion gravity settling removes the crystals from the remaining liquid a layer of dense early formed minerals at the base of an intrusion or magma chamber is known a cumulate layerfilter pressing during the crystallisation of magma there is a point where crystals and liquid exists in a slushy mass due to the weight of overlying crystals the liquid gets squeezed our to form a separate layer above the liquid is depleted in in the elements incorporated into the early formed minerals and enriched in the elements which form felsic mineralsif the parent magma is mafic  if the parent magma is mafic then in theory it will produce  peridotite at the base of the intrusion which is rich in dense olivine gabbro forming the main part of the intrusion  diorite may form towards the top of the intrusion  granite may form form veins or thin layer at the top of the intrusionmajor layered intrusions these are large mafic or ultramafic igneous intrusions which cooled slowly below the surface so there was time form them to form distinct layers gravity settling is the main process in the formation of layers of magnetite chromite and platinumthe palisade sill the palisade cell in new jersey is over m thick and was intruded into triassic sediments at a depth of about  km  the only parts of the sill to cool rapidly are the upper and lower edges which where in contact with the cold country rock these chilled margins have fine grained crystals and most importantly have the same composition as the original magma because they cooled before differentiation could take place the rock is basalt  as the main part of the intrusion began to crystallise the early formed olivine crystals began to sink by gravity settling olivine has as density between gcm compared to the mafic lava of gcm the olivine layer form a layer m thick at the base of the intrusion just above the chilled margin crystallisation will take place from both the top and the bottom of the sill as the crystals grew in cooler areas the main rock forming the intrusion is medium grained dolerite the last part of the intrusion to crystallise is about m above the base and is coarse grained gabbro because it cooled slowly as a result of fractionation the composition is lower in mafic minerals than the original composition because the gam is depleted in iron and magnesium it is rich in plagioclase as the last part of magma is enriched in silicaintrusions intrusive igneous rocks are those that crystallise below the earth surface intrusions are described as concordant where they are intruded along bedding planes and discordant where they are intruded and cut across needing planes when magma is is moving up through country rock the intrusion will follow any line of weakness this could be a fault joint or bedding planeminor intrusions vary a lot in size  cool at hypabyssal depths  most sills and dykes are composed of media grained mafic rock dolerite except along the margins where chilling by finer rained country rock will form basalt sills and dykes that have granite as source will be made of porphyry or micro granite which are both medium grained silicic rockssill sills are sheet like intrusions that are concordant and parallel to the beds some sills occasionally cut across the beds in step from one bed to another to form transgressive sills they are generally irregular with variable widths and sinuous outcrops they are usually intruded along bedding planes sills are intruded when fluid pressure is so greta that the underlying magma actually lifts the overlying rocks this means that sills usually from at shallow depths in the earth where the weight of overlying rock is not to greatdyke dykes are sheet like intrusions which discordant and often vertical they range in size from a few cm to more than m thick and commonly m across as most dykes are vertical they from straight lines in an outcrop forming long thin features they are often intruded along the zones of weakness in the country rock such as faults or joints dykes are commonly feeder vents under volcanoes so may have a radial patternmajor intrusions cool plutonic deep below the earth surface  the most common form of major intrusion is a batholith  the peruchili batholith is km long  most batholiths are discordant where they are intruded into country rock the outcrop of many batholiths is roughly circular in shape with steep sides batholiths are mainly granite in composition although they can be composed of diorite or granodiorite all of which are coarse grained they could very slowly at km deepformation of granite magmas most batholiths are intruded at convergent plate boundaries where they from the core of fold mountains which have resulted from plate collision high temperature mafic magmas will rise up through the crust and the heat from these will partially melt the continental crust partical melting produces silicic magma which rises because it is less dense than the rock it was produced from silicic magma is viscous and therefore rises through the crusts slowly it is difficult for it to mix with other magmas as the viscosity is so different batholiths are huge bodies of magma usually formed by repeated intrusions of magma into the same area as the magma rises it generates more magma through stoping and assimilationstoping and assimilation at shallow depths of around k the crust is cold and brittle and batholiths may intruded by stoping magma moves upwards along joins  faults and bedding planes separating masses of country rock eventually pieces of country rock are detached and settle into the magma were they are known as xenoliths now new space is created during stoping as the magma simply fills the space formerly occupied by the country rock as the xenoliths fall into the magma most will be assimilated as they gradually melt to produce more magmachilled margin is where the igneous rock has cooled rapidly so it has fine crystals may be a few cm

longer the rocks will be totally recrystallised to form hornfelmetamorphic rock further away from the intrusion the rock will be recrystallised to form a rock containing the metamorphic mineral andalusite in the zone just inside the metamorphic aureole where the heat was least recrystallisation is partial so spotted rock forms the width depends on size and temperature of the intrusion and the dip of sidesthe difference between intrusive sills and extrusive lava flows sills have two chilled margins due to contact with cool country rock from both above and below lava flow only has one clear chilled margin below  sills have two baked margins both above and below because the sill heats all the country rock around it a lava flow only has one baked margin below the lava flow and none above as when it formed there was only air above sill xenoliths from rocks above and below the sill as the sill rips up material lava flow no xenoliths from above the sill maybe some from below sill medium average crystal size as hypabyssal and cooled slowly lava flow fine grained crystals as cooled quickly as volcanic sill may show differentiation of magma of the sills cools slow and is thick lava flow may have flow banding or phenocrysts may be aligned parallel to the direction of flow sills mostly composed of dolerite  lava flows most common rock is basalt  rare vesicles for sills lava flows have common vesicles in the upper part and may become amygdale which filled in with minerals  a sill will have no weathering on the upper surface a lava flow may have a reddened surface or even an ancient soil if the flow was chemically weatheredvolcanic gasses all atmospheric gasses apart from photosynthetic oxygen was released by volcanoes the gases are dissolved in the magma whilst its at high pressure at depth then as pressure decreases nearer the surface the gases are released by an eruption the main gases are water vapour co  nitrogen and sulphur dioxide rain can be acidic close to volcanoes as the sulphur mixes with water condensationlava flows lava flows from recent eruptions can be very distinctive but ancient lavas are more difficult to recognise as they usually alike the surface patterns of rubbly blocks and flow patternsmafic lavas mafic lavas are of low viscosity and flows of basalt they are thin and wide spread over kms because they are fluid they cool to form aa lavas with rough blocky jagged surfaces and pahoehoe flows which are smooth and have a ropy surface the pahoehoe flows are less viscous than aa flows and as the lava cools it becomes even more viscous so that pahoehoe flow may become an aa erupting lavas may have a temperature of  to c but most do not flow very fast  if lavas cool underrated pillow lava may formaa lava flowpahoehoe lava flowintermediate and silica lava flows viscous flows of andesite are irregular and tend to be limited around the cone silica flows of rhyolite are rear as they are very viscous so they tend to be thick but in a small area very stickily lava flows can lava domes within in he crater and often shows flow bandingpyroclastic material magma can be explosively or forcefully ejected into the atmosphere as particles called pyroclasts ash is the smallest particles size and is less than mm in size and forms pyroclastic rock tuff when consolidated lapilli are particles which are mm to  mm and form lapilli tuff bombs and blocks are the coarsest particles over  mm in size and form pyroclastic rock agglomerates close to the crater of the volcano nuee ardent are gaseous magma that form the

equal thickness of a deposits such as ash the maps are called isopach mapsdistribution by wind where the wind blows in the prevailing directions during an eruption the ash will be deposited mainly on the leeward side of the volcano the has cloud could be carried the wind over high distances and if it gets into the jet stream then it could go right around the world the higher the winds velocity the further the ash can eb carrieddistribution by energy blast the most obvious relationship is that the greater the energy blast the further away from the volcano the pyroclasts will be found however it is likely that the blast energy will be directed in one direction so that even very close to the volcanoes ether could be very little effect if the blast was in a different directionlahars lahars are mudflows of wet ash and volcanic debris that flow rapidly down a mountain side volcanic activity can cause rapid melting of snow which produces melt water the meltwater surges down the mountain side

it determines how the lava flow all behave it control the length of the lava flows the velocity at which they flow and shape of the volcanohighly viscous rhyolite and andesite lavas volcano will have steep sides  eruptions are infrequent  lava flows more slowly are short in length and tend to be thick trapped gasses may escape explosively  there are explosive eruptions and tuffs and pyroclastic flows formbasalt lavas with a low viscosity the volcano will have shallow sides but wherever the slopes are steeper the flow will speed up eruptions will be frequent  lava flows easily forming long flows in channel tubes  gases are easily released  eruptions are rarely pyroclastic and are usually quiet  cooler basaltic lava is more viscousmafic volcanoes the viscosity of the magma is lower because the silica content is lower so basaltic lava flows faster the gas content of the magma is higher but the low viscosity of the magma allows gas to escape so that the eruptions are quiet and non explosive eruptions are frequent sometimes daily but often every few years the activity is described as effusive classified as hawaiian  occur at divergent plate boundaries or hotspotsshield volcanoes have gentle sloping slopes of less than  degrees and a roughly circular shape around a central vent composed of thin basalt lava flows built up form a central point and fissure eruptions on the flanks of the volcano the low viscosity of the lava allows it to the lava to travel down the side of the volcano on a gentle slope but as it cools and becomes more viscous it thickens up and builds up on the lower flanks forming a steeper lower slope very little pyroclastic material is found within a shield volcanofissure eruptionsare where magma reaches the surface along long linear cracks or fissures

sedimentary and metamorphic igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava the magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planets mantle or crust typically the melting is caused by one or more of three processes an increase in temperature a decrease in pressure or a change in composition solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular crystalline rocks or without crystallization to form natural glasses

the earths oceanic crust is made of igneous rock igneous rocks are also geologically important because their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle from which some igneous rocks are extracted and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction andor of other preexisting rock that melted their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata allowing a time sequence of events their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment allowing tectonic reconstitutions see plate tectonics in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits ores for example tungsten tin and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros geological setting forming of igneous rock in terms of modes of occurrence igneous rocks can be either intrusive plutonic and hypabyssal or extrusive volcanic intrusive closeup of granite an intrusive igneous rock exposed in chennai india intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet surrounded by preexisting rock called country rock the magma cools slowly and as a result these rocks are coarsegrained the mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes typical intrusive formations are batholiths stocks laccoliths sills and dikes when the magma solidifies within the earths crust it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks such as granite gabbro or diorite the central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks usually granite when exposed by erosion these cores called batholiths may occupy huge areas of the earths surface intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic or abyssal rocks and are usually coarsegrained intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually mediumgrained hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes sills laccoliths lopoliths or phacoliths extrusive extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes sample of basalt an extrusive igneous rock found in massachusetts extrusive igneous rocks also known as volcanic rocks are formed at the crusts surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks they are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earths surface the magma which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions solidifies at a faster rate hence such rocks are smooth crystalline and finegrained basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows lava sheets and lava plateaus some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns the giants causeway in antrim northern ireland is an example the molten rock with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles is called magma it rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created when magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air it is called lava eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine black smokers and midocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity the volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions divergent boundary  convergent boundary subduction zone  hotspot  magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity determined by temperature composition crystal content and the amount of silica hightemperature magma most of which is basaltic in composition behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and as it cools treacle long thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common intermediate composition magma such as andesite tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash tuff and lava and may have a viscosity similar to thick cold molasses or even rubber when erupted felsic magma such as rhyolite is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to  times as viscous as basalt volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins because the magma is so viscous felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour but also carbon dioxide explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff agglomerate and ignimbrite fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits which can often cover vast areas because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly it is usually finegrained if the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion the resulting rock may be mostly glass such as the rock obsidian if the cooling of the lava happened more slowly the rock would be coarsegrained because the minerals are mostly finegrained it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks generally the mineral constituents of finegrained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field classification igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence texture mineralogy chemical composition and the geometry of the igneous body the classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size which largely depends on the cooling history and the mineral composition of the rock feldspars quartz or feldspathoids olivines pyroxenes amphiboles and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks and they are basic to the classification of these rocks all other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates in a simplified classification igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present the presence or absence of quartz and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz the type of iron or magnesium minerals present rocks containing quartz silica in composition are silicaoversaturated rocks with feldspathoids are silicaundersaturated because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic generally speaking phaneritic implies an intrusive origin aphanitic an extrusive one an igneous rock with larger clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finergrained matrix is termed porphyry porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finergrained uniform material igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition texture refers to the size shape and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed texture gabbro specimen showing phaneritic texture rock creek canyon eastern sierra nevada california scale bar is  cm main article rock microstructure texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks the texture of volcanic rocks including the size shape orientation and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava however the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely finegrained groundmass or from airfall tuffs which may be formed from volcanic ash textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens magnifying glass or microscope plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes apophyses mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks with phenocryst species used as a prefix eg olivinebearing picrite or orthoclasephyric rhyolite see also list of rock textures and igneous textures basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy if the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram this is not an exact method because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica yet in most cases it is a good first guess chemical classification and petrology total alkali versus silica classification scheme tas as proposed in le maitres  igneous rocks  a classification and glossary of terms igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters chemical total alkalisilica content tas diagram for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable felsic igneous rocks containing a high silica content greater than  sio examples granite and rhyolite intermediate igneous rocks containing between  –  sio example andesite and dacite mafic igneous rocks have low silica  –  and typically high iron – magnesium content example gabbro and basalt ultramafic rock igneous rocks with less than  silica examples picrite komatiite and peridotite alkalic igneous rocks with  –  alkali ko  nao content or with a molar ratio of alkali to silica greater than  examples phonolite and trachyte chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the tas diagram for instance ultrapotassic rocks containing molar konao  peralkaline rocks containing molar ko  nao alo  peraluminous rocks containing molar ko  nao alo  an idealized mineralogy the normative mineralogy can be calculated from the chemical composition and the calculation is useful for rocks too finegrained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt for instance normative quartz classifies a rock as silicaoversaturated an example is rhyolite in an older terminology silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the sio was greater than  and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic a normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silicaundersaturated an example is nephelinite history of classification in  a group of american petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a quantitative classification based on chemical analysis they showed how vague and often unscientific much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic it should be elevated to prime position geological occurrence structure mineralogical constitution—the hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background the completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rockforming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes eg quartz feldspars olivine akermannite feldspathoids magnetite corundum and so on and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another mineralogical classification for volcanic rocks mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas the most important criterion is the phenocryst species followed by the groundmass mineralogy often where the groundmass is aphanitic chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock mineralogic contents – felsic versus mafic felsic rock highest content of silicon with predominance of quartz alkali feldspar andor feldspathoids the felsic minerals these rocks eg granite rhyolite are usually light coloured and have low density mafic rock lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes olivines and calcic plagioclase these rocks example basalt gabbro are usually dark coloured and have a higher density than felsic rocks ultramafic rock lowest content of silicon with more than  of mafic minerals eg dunite for intrusive plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks where all minerals are visible at least via microscope the mineralogy is used to classify the rock this usually occurs on ternary diagrams where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock the following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence composition mode of occurrence felsic intermediate mafic ultramafic intrusive granite diorite gabbro peridotite extrusive rhyolite andesite basalt komatiite for a more detailed classification see qapf diagram example of classification granite is an igneous intrusive rock crystallized at depth with felsic composition rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassiumrich feldspar plus sodiumrich plagioclase and phaneritic subeuhedral texture minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes magma origination the earths crust averages about  kilometers thick under the continents but averages only some – kilometers beneath the oceans the continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks including granulite and granite oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure to a change in composition such as an addition of water to an increase in temperature or to a combination of these processes other mechanisms such as melting from a meteorite impact are less important today but impacts during the accretion of the earth led to extensive melting and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early earth was probably an ocean of magma impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces decompression decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure the solidus temperatures of most rocks the temperatures below which they are completely solid increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water peridotite at depth in the earths mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level if such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process but the cooling is only about  °c per kilometer experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by  °c to  °c per kilometer if the rock rises far enough it will begin to melt melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards this process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the earth decompression melting creates the ocean crust at midocean ridges it also causes volcanism in intraplate regions such as europe africa and the pacific sea floor there it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes the plume hypothesis or to intraplate extension the plate hypothesis effects of water and carbon dioxide the change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure for example at a depth of about  kilometers peridotite begins to melt near  °c in the presence of excess water but near or above about  °c in the absence of water water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones and it causes melting in the overlying mantle hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process such magmas and those derived from them build up island arcs such as those in the pacific ring of fire these magmas form rocks of the calcalkaline series an important part of the continental crust the addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water but genesis of some silicaundersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions in the presence of carbon dioxide experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about  °c in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about  km at greater depths carbon dioxide can have more effect at depths to about  km the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be  °c to  °c lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide magmas of rock types such as nephelinite carbonatite and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about  km temperature increase increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary the plate boundary between the indian and asian continental masses provides a wellstudied example as the tibetan plateau just north of the boundary has crust about  kilometers thick roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least  kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the tibetan plateau granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone magma evolution schematic diagrams showing the principles behind fractional crystallisation in a magma while cooling the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt  olivine crystallizes  olivine and pyroxene crystallize  pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize  plagioclase crystallizes at the bottom of the magma reservoir a cumulate rock forms main article igneous differentiation most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories more typically they are mixes of melt and crystals and sometimes also of gas bubbles melt crystals and bubbles usually have different densities and so they can separate as magmas evolve as magma cools minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures fractional crystallization as minerals crystallize the composition of the residual melt typically changes if crystals separate from the melt then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma for instance a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near  °c and the derivative granitecomposition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about  °c incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements bowens reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization for instance magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them magmas of different compositions can mix with one another in rare cases melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions there are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements silicon oxygen aluminium sodium potassium calcium iron and magnesium these are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks the chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides eg  sio and  tio abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight eg  ppm ni and  ppm sm the term trace element is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than  ppm or so but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding  ppm

latin word ignis meaning fire or magmatic rock is one of the three main rock types the others being sedimentary and metamorphic igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava the magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planets mantle or crust typically the melting is caused by one or more of three processes an increase in temperature a decrease in pressure or a change in composition solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks igneous rock may form with

 km of the earths crust by volume igneous rocks form about  of the earths current land surfacenote  most of the earths oceanic crust is made of igneous rock igneous rocks are also geologically important because their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle from which some igneous rocks are extracted and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction andor of other preexisting rock that melted their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata allowing a time sequence of events their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment allowing tectonic reconstitutions see plate tectonics in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits ores for example tungsten tin and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros geological setting forming of igneous rock in terms of modes of occurrence igneous rocks can be either intrusive plutonic and hypabyssal or extrusive volcanic intrusive closeup of granite an intrusive igneous rock exposed in chennai india intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet surrounded by preexisting rock called country rock the magma cools slowly and as a result these rocks are coarsegrained the mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes typical intrusive formations are batholiths stocks laccoliths sills and dikes when the magma solidifies within the earths crust it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks such as granite gabbro or diorite the central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks usually granite when exposed by erosion these cores called batholiths may occupy huge areas of the earths surface intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic or abyssal rocks and are usually coarsegrained intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually mediumgrained hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes sills laccoliths lopoliths or phacoliths extrusive extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes sample of basalt an extrusive igneous rock found in massachusetts extrusive igneous rocks also known as volcanic rocks are formed at the crusts surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks they are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earths surface the magma which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions solidifies at a faster rate hence such rocks are smooth crystalline and finegrained basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows lava sheets and lava plateaus some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns the giants causeway in antrim northern ireland is an example the molten rock with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles is called magma it rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created when magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air it is called lava eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine black smokers and midocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity the volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions divergent boundary  convergent boundary subduction zone  hotspot  magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity determined by temperature composition crystal content and the amount of silica hightemperature magma most of which is basaltic in composition behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and as it cools treacle long thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common intermediate composition magma such as andesite tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash tuff and lava and may have a viscosity similar to thick cold molasses or even rubber when erupted felsic magma such as rhyolite is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to  times as viscous as basalt volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins because the magma is so viscous felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour but also carbon dioxide explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff agglomerate and ignimbrite fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits which can often cover vast areas because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly it is usually finegrained if the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion the resulting rock may be mostly glass such as the rock obsidian if the cooling of the lava happened more slowly the rock would be coarsegrained because the minerals are mostly finegrained it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks generally the mineral constituents of finegrained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field classification igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence texture mineralogy chemical composition and the geometry of the igneous body the classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size which largely depends on the cooling history and the mineral composition of the rock feldspars quartz or feldspathoids olivines pyroxenes amphiboles and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks and they are basic to the classification of these rocks all other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates in a simplified classification igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present the presence or absence of quartz and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz the type of iron or magnesium minerals present rocks containing quartz silica in composition are silicaoversaturated rocks with feldspathoids are silicaundersaturated because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic generally speaking phaneritic implies an intrusive origin aphanitic an extrusive one an igneous rock with larger clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finergrained matrix is termed porphyry porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finergrained uniform material igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition texture refers to the size shape and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed texture gabbro specimen showing phaneritic texture rock creek canyon eastern sierra nevada california scale bar is  cm main article rock microstructure texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks the texture of volcanic rocks including the size shape orientation and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava however the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely finegrained groundmass or from airfall tuffs which may be formed from volcanic ash textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens magnifying glass or microscope plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes apophyses mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks with phenocryst species used as a prefix eg olivinebearing picrite or orthoclasephyric rhyolite see also list of rock textures and igneous textures basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy if the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram this is not an exact method because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica yet in

extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the tas diagram for instance ultrapotassic rocks containing molar konao  peralkaline rocks containing molar ko  nao alo  peraluminous rocks containing molar ko  nao alo  an idealized mineralogy the normative mineralogy can be calculated from the chemical composition and the calculation is useful for rocks too finegrained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt for instance normative quartz classifies a rock as silicaoversaturated an example is rhyolite in an older terminology silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the sio was greater than  and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic a normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silicaundersaturated an example is nephelinite history of classification in  a group of american petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a quantitative classification based on chemical analysis they showed how vague and often unscientific much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic it should be elevated to prime position geological occurrence structure mineralogical constitution—the hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background the completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rockforming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes eg quartz feldspars olivine akermannite feldspathoids magnetite corundum and so on and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another mineralogical classification for volcanic rocks mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas the most important criterion is the phenocryst species followed by the groundmass mineralogy often where the groundmass is aphanitic chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock mineralogic contents – felsic versus mafic felsic rock highest content of silicon with predominance of quartz alkali feldspar andor feldspathoids the felsic minerals these rocks eg granite rhyolite are usually light coloured and have low density mafic rock lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes olivines and calcic plagioclase these rocks example basalt gabbro are usually dark coloured and have a higher density than felsic rocks ultramafic rock lowest content of silicon with more than  of mafic minerals eg dunite for intrusive plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks where all minerals are visible at least via microscope the mineralogy is used to classify the rock this usually occurs on ternary diagrams where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock the following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence composition mode of occurrence felsic intermediate mafic ultramafic intrusive granite diorite gabbro peridotite extrusive rhyolite andesite basalt komatiite for a more detailed classification see qapf diagram example of classification granite is an igneous intrusive rock crystallized at depth with felsic composition rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassiumrich feldspar plus sodiumrich plagioclase and phaneritic subeuhedral texture minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes magma origination the earths crust averages about  kilometers thick under the continents but averages only some – kilometers beneath the oceans the continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks including granulite and granite oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure to a change in composition such as an addition of water to an increase in temperature or to a combination of these processes other mechanisms such as melting from a meteorite impact are less important today but impacts during the accretion of the earth led to extensive melting and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early earth was probably an ocean of magma impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces decompression decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure the solidus temperatures of most rocks the temperatures below which they are completely solid increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water peridotite at depth in the earths mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level if such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process but the cooling is only about  °c per kilometer experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by  °c to  °c per kilometer if the rock rises far enough it will begin to melt melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards this process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the earth decompression melting creates the ocean crust at midocean ridges it also causes volcanism in intraplate regions such as europe africa and the pacific sea floor there it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes the plume hypothesis or to intraplate extension the plate hypothesis effects of water and carbon dioxide the change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure for example at a depth of about  kilometers peridotite begins to melt near  °c in the presence of excess water but near or above about  °c in the absence of water water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones and it causes melting in the overlying mantle hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process such magmas and those derived from them build up island arcs such as those in the pacific ring of fire these magmas form rocks of the calcalkaline series an important part of the continental crust the addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water but genesis of some silicaundersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions in the presence of carbon dioxide experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about  °c in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about  km at greater depths carbon dioxide can have more effect at depths to about  km the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be  °c to  °c lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide magmas of rock types such as nephelinite carbonatite and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about  km temperature increase increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary the plate boundary between the indian and asian continental masses provides a wellstudied example as the tibetan plateau just north of the boundary has crust about  kilometers thick roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least  kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the tibetan plateau granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone magma evolution schematic diagrams showing the principles behind fractional crystallisation in a magma while cooling the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt  olivine crystallizes  olivine and pyroxene crystallize  pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize  plagioclase crystallizes at the bottom of the magma reservoir a cumulate rock forms main article igneous differentiation most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories more typically they are mixes of melt and crystals and sometimes also of gas bubbles melt crystals and bubbles usually have different densities and so they can separate as magmas evolve as magma cools minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures fractional crystallization as minerals crystallize the composition of the residual melt typically changes if crystals separate from the melt then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma for instance a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near  °c and the derivative granitecomposition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about  °c incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements bowens reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization for instance magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them magmas of different compositions can mix with one another in rare cases melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions there are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements silicon oxygen aluminium sodium potassium calcium iron and magnesium these are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks the chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides eg  sio and  tio abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight eg  ppm ni and  ppm sm the term trace element is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than  ppm or so but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding  ppm the diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical

kilometers beneath the oceans the continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks including granulite and granite oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure to a change in composition such as an addition of water to an increase in temperature or to a combination of these processes other mechanisms such as melting from a meteorite impact are less important today but impacts during the accretion of the earth led to extensive melting and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early earth was probably an ocean of magma impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces decompression decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure the solidus temperatures of most rocks the temperatures below which they are completely solid increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water peridotite at depth in the earths mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level if such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process but the cooling is only about  °c per kilometer experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by  °c to  °c per kilometer if the rock rises far enough it will begin to melt melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards this process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the earth decompression melting creates the ocean crust at midocean ridges it also causes volcanism in intraplate regions such as europe africa and the pacific sea floor there it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes the plume hypothesis or to intraplate extension the plate hypothesis effects of water and carbon dioxide the change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure for example at a depth of about  kilometers peridotite begins to melt near  °c in the presence of excess water but near or above about  °c in the absence of water water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones and it causes melting in the overlying mantle hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process such magmas and those derived from them build up island arcs such as those in the pacific ring of fire these magmas form rocks of the calcalkaline series an important part of the continental crust the addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water but genesis of some silicaundersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions in the presence of carbon dioxide experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about  °c in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about  km at greater depths carbon dioxide can have more effect at depths to about  km the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be  °c to  °c lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide magmas of rock types such as nephelinite carbonatite and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about  km temperature increase increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary the plate boundary between the indian and asian continental masses provides a wellstudied example as the tibetan plateau just north of the boundary has crust about  kilometers thick roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least  kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the tibetan plateau granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone magma evolution schematic diagrams

and pyroxene crystallize  pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize  plagioclase crystallizes at the bottom of the magma reservoir a cumulate rock forms main article igneous differentiation most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories more typically they are mixes of melt and crystals and sometimes also of gas bubbles melt crystals and bubbles usually have different densities and so they can separate as magmas evolve as magma cools minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures fractional crystallization as minerals crystallize the composition of the residual melt typically changes if crystals separate from the melt then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma for instance a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near  °c and the derivative granitecomposition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about  °c incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements bowens reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization for instance magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them magmas of different compositions can mix with one another in rare cases melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions there are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements silicon oxygen aluminium sodium potassium calcium iron and magnesium these are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks the chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides eg  sio and  tio abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight eg  ppm ni and  ppm sm the term trace element is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than  ppm or so but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding  ppm the diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical

latin word ignis meaning fire or magmatic rock is one of the three main rock types the others being sedimentary and metamorphic igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava the magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planets mantle or crust typically the melting is caused by one or more of three processes an increase in temperature a decrease in pressure or a change in composition solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks igneous rock may form with

 km of the earths crust by volume igneous rocks form about  of the earths current land surfacenote  most of the earths oceanic crust is made of igneous rock igneous rocks are also geologically important because their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle from which some igneous rocks are extracted and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction andor of other preexisting rock that melted their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata allowing a time sequence of events their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment allowing tectonic reconstitutions see plate tectonics in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits ores for example tungsten tin and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros geological setting forming of igneous rock in terms of modes of occurrence igneous rocks can be either intrusive plutonic and hypabyssal or extrusive volcanic intrusive closeup of granite an intrusive igneous rock exposed in chennai india intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet surrounded by preexisting rock called country rock the magma cools slowly and as a result these rocks are coarsegrained the mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes typical intrusive formations are batholiths stocks laccoliths sills and dikes when the magma solidifies within the earths crust it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks such as granite gabbro or diorite the central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks usually granite when exposed by erosion these cores called batholiths may occupy huge areas of the earths surface intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic or abyssal rocks and are usually coarsegrained intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually mediumgrained hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes sills laccoliths lopoliths or phacoliths extrusive extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes sample of basalt an extrusive igneous rock found in massachusetts extrusive igneous rocks also known as volcanic rocks are formed at the crusts surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks they are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earths surface the magma which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions solidifies at a faster rate hence such rocks are smooth crystalline and finegrained basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows lava sheets and lava plateaus some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns the giants causeway in antrim northern ireland is an example the molten rock with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles is called magma it rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created when magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air it is called lava eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine black smokers and midocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity the volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions divergent boundary  convergent boundary subduction zone  hotspot  magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity determined by temperature composition crystal content and the amount of silica hightemperature magma most of which is basaltic in composition behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and as it cools treacle long thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common intermediate composition magma such as andesite tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash tuff and lava and may have a viscosity similar to thick cold molasses or even rubber when erupted felsic magma such as rhyolite is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to  times as viscous as basalt volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins because the magma is so viscous felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour but also carbon dioxide explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff agglomerate and ignimbrite fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits which can often cover vast areas because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly it is usually finegrained if the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion the resulting rock may be mostly glass such as the rock obsidian if the cooling of the lava happened more slowly the rock would be coarsegrained because the minerals are mostly finegrained it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks generally the mineral constituents of finegrained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field classification igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence texture mineralogy chemical composition and the geometry of the igneous body the classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size which largely depends on the cooling history and the mineral composition of the rock feldspars quartz or feldspathoids olivines pyroxenes amphiboles and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks and they are basic to the classification of these rocks all other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates in a simplified classification igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present the presence or absence of quartz and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz the type of iron or magnesium minerals present rocks containing quartz silica in composition are silicaoversaturated rocks with feldspathoids are silicaundersaturated because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic generally speaking phaneritic implies an intrusive origin aphanitic an extrusive one an igneous rock with larger clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finergrained matrix is termed porphyry porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finergrained uniform material igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition texture refers to the size shape and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed texture gabbro specimen showing phaneritic texture rock creek canyon eastern sierra nevada california scale bar is  cm main article rock microstructure texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks the texture of volcanic rocks including the size shape orientation and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava however the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely finegrained groundmass or from airfall tuffs which may be formed from volcanic ash textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens magnifying glass or microscope plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes apophyses mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks with phenocryst species used as a prefix eg olivinebearing picrite or orthoclasephyric rhyolite see also list of rock textures and igneous textures basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy if the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram this is not an exact method because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica yet in

intrude both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them magmas of different compositions can mix with one another in rare cases melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions there are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements silicon oxygen aluminium sodium potassium calcium iron and magnesium these are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks the chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides eg  sio and  tio abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight eg  ppm ni and  ppm sm the term trace element is typically used for elements present in most rocks

latin word ignis meaning fire or magmatic rock is one of the three main rock types the others being sedimentary and metamorphic igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava the magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planets mantle or crust typically the melting is caused by one or more of three processes an increase in temperature a decrease in pressure or a change in composition solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks igneous rock may form with

 km of the earths crust by volume igneous rocks form about  of the earths current land surfacenote  most of the earths oceanic crust is made of igneous rock igneous rocks are also geologically important because their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle from which some igneous rocks are extracted and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction andor of other preexisting rock that melted their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata allowing a time sequence of events their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment allowing tectonic reconstitutions see plate tectonics in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits ores for example tungsten tin and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros geological setting forming of igneous rock in terms of modes of occurrence igneous rocks can be either intrusive plutonic and hypabyssal or extrusive volcanic intrusive closeup of granite an intrusive igneous rock exposed in chennai india intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet surrounded by preexisting rock called country rock the magma cools slowly and as a result these rocks are coarsegrained the mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes typical intrusive formations are batholiths stocks laccoliths sills and dikes when the magma solidifies within the earths crust it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks such as granite gabbro or diorite the central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks usually granite when exposed by erosion these cores called batholiths may occupy huge areas of the earths surface intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic or abyssal rocks and are usually coarsegrained intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually mediumgrained hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes sills laccoliths lopoliths or phacoliths extrusive extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes sample of basalt an extrusive igneous rock found in massachusetts extrusive igneous rocks also known as volcanic rocks are formed at the crusts surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks they are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earths surface the magma which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions solidifies at a faster rate hence such rocks are smooth crystalline and finegrained basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows lava sheets and lava plateaus some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns the giants causeway in antrim northern ireland is an example the molten rock with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles is called magma it rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created when magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air it is called lava eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine black smokers and midocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity the volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions divergent boundary  convergent boundary subduction zone  hotspot  magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity determined by temperature composition crystal content and the amount of silica hightemperature magma most of which is basaltic in composition behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and as it cools treacle long thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common intermediate composition magma such as andesite tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash tuff and lava and may have a viscosity similar to thick cold molasses or even rubber when erupted felsic magma such as rhyolite is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to  times as viscous as basalt volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins because the magma is so viscous felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour but also carbon dioxide explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff agglomerate and ignimbrite fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits which can often cover vast areas because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly it is usually finegrained if the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion the resulting rock may be mostly glass such as the rock obsidian if the cooling of the lava happened more slowly the rock would be coarsegrained because the minerals are mostly finegrained it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks generally the mineral constituents of finegrained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field classification igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence texture mineralogy chemical composition and the geometry of the igneous body the classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size which largely depends on the cooling history and the mineral composition of the rock feldspars quartz or feldspathoids olivines pyroxenes amphiboles and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks and they are basic to the classification of these rocks all other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates in a simplified classification igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present the presence or absence of quartz and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz the type of iron or magnesium minerals present rocks containing quartz silica in composition are silicaoversaturated rocks with feldspathoids are silicaundersaturated because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic generally speaking phaneritic implies an intrusive origin aphanitic an extrusive one an igneous rock with larger clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finergrained matrix is termed porphyry porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finergrained uniform material igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition texture refers to the size shape and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed texture gabbro specimen showing phaneritic texture rock creek canyon eastern sierra nevada california scale bar is  cm main article rock microstructure texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks the texture of volcanic rocks including the size shape orientation and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava however the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely finegrained groundmass or from airfall tuffs which may be formed from volcanic ash textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens magnifying glass or microscope plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes apophyses mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks with phenocryst species used as a prefix eg olivinebearing picrite or orthoclasephyric rhyolite see also list of rock textures and igneous textures basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy if the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram this is not an exact method because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica yet in most cases it is a good first guess chemical classification and petrology total alkali versus silica classification scheme tas as proposed in le maitres  igneous rocks  a classification and glossary of terms igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters chemical total alkalisilica content tas diagram for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable felsic igneous rocks containing a high silica content greater than  sio examples granite and rhyolite intermediate igneous rocks containing between  –  sio example andesite and dacite mafic igneous rocks have low silica  –  and typically high iron – magnesium content example gabbro and basalt ultramafic rock igneous rocks with less than  silica examples picrite komatiite and peridotite alkalic igneous rocks with  –  alkali ko  nao content or with a molar ratio of alkali to silica greater than  examples phonolite and trachyte chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the tas diagram for instance ultrapotassic rocks containing molar konao  peralkaline rocks containing molar ko  nao alo  peraluminous rocks containing molar ko  nao alo  an idealized mineralogy the normative mineralogy can be calculated from the chemical composition and the calculation is useful for rocks too finegrained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt for instance normative quartz classifies a rock as silicaoversaturated an example is rhyolite in an older terminology silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the sio was greater than  and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic a normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silicaundersaturated an example is nephelinite history of classification in  a group of american petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a quantitative classification based on chemical analysis they showed how vague and often unscientific much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic it should be elevated to prime position geological occurrence structure mineralogical constitution—the hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background the completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rockforming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes eg quartz feldspars olivine akermannite feldspathoids magnetite corundum and so on and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another mineralogical classification for volcanic rocks mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas the most important criterion is the phenocryst species followed by the groundmass mineralogy often where the groundmass is aphanitic chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock mineralogic contents – felsic versus mafic felsic rock highest content of silicon with predominance of quartz alkali feldspar andor feldspathoids the felsic minerals these rocks eg granite rhyolite are usually light coloured and have low density mafic rock lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes olivines and calcic plagioclase these rocks example basalt gabbro are usually dark coloured and have a higher density than felsic rocks ultramafic rock lowest content of silicon with more than  of mafic minerals eg dunite for intrusive plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks where all minerals are visible at least via microscope the mineralogy is used to classify the rock this usually occurs on ternary diagrams where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock the following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence composition mode of occurrence felsic intermediate mafic ultramafic intrusive granite diorite gabbro peridotite extrusive rhyolite andesite basalt komatiite for a more detailed classification see qapf diagram example of classification granite is an igneous intrusive rock crystallized at depth with felsic composition rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassiumrich feldspar plus sodiumrich plagioclase and phaneritic subeuhedral texture minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes magma origination the earths crust averages about  kilometers thick under the continents but averages only some – kilometers beneath the oceans the continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks including granulite and granite oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure to a change in composition such as an addition of water to an increase in temperature or to a combination of these processes other mechanisms such as melting from a meteorite impact are less important today but impacts during the accretion of the earth led to extensive melting and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early earth was probably an ocean of magma impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces decompression decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure the solidus temperatures of most rocks the temperatures below which they are completely solid increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water peridotite at depth in the earths mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level if such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process but the cooling is only about  °c per kilometer experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by  °c to  °c per kilometer if the rock rises far enough it will begin to melt melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards this process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the earth decompression melting creates the ocean crust at midocean ridges it also causes volcanism in intraplate regions such as europe africa and the pacific sea floor there it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes the plume hypothesis or to intraplate extension the plate hypothesis effects of water and carbon dioxide the change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure for example at a depth of about  kilometers peridotite begins to melt near  °c in the presence of excess water but near or above about  °c in the absence of water water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones and it causes melting in the overlying mantle hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process such magmas and those derived from them build up island arcs such as those in the pacific ring of fire these magmas form rocks of the calcalkaline series an important part of the continental crust the addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water but genesis of some silicaundersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions in the presence of carbon dioxide experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about  °c in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about  km at greater depths carbon dioxide can have more effect at depths to about  km the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be  °c to  °c lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide magmas of rock types such as nephelinite carbonatite and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about  km temperature increase increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary the plate boundary between the indian and asian continental masses provides a wellstudied example as the tibetan plateau just north of the boundary has crust about  kilometers thick roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least  kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the tibetan plateau granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone magma evolution schematic diagrams showing the principles behind fractional crystallisation in a magma while cooling the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt  olivine crystallizes  olivine and pyroxene crystallize  pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize  plagioclase crystallizes at the bottom of the magma reservoir a cumulate rock forms main article igneous differentiation most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories more typically they are mixes of melt and crystals and sometimes also of gas bubbles melt crystals and bubbles usually have different densities and so they can separate as magmas evolve as magma cools minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures fractional crystallization as minerals crystallize the composition of the residual melt typically changes if crystals separate from the melt then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma for instance a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near  °c and the derivative granitecomposition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about  °c incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements bowens reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization for instance magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them magmas of different compositions can mix with one another in rare cases melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions there are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements silicon oxygen aluminium sodium potassium calcium iron and magnesium these are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks the chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides eg  sio and  tio abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight eg  ppm ni and  ppm sm the term trace element is typically used for elements present in most rocks

ash flows resulting in a high flat surface these are very similar to processes that give rise to mountains and mountain ranges the only major difference is that a plateau is flat while mountains are peaked see full answer filed under geology q what is the difference between soil and sand a soil is made up of liquids solids and gases that form on the surface of land while sand is a natural material that consists of at least  percent sandsized particles soil consists mostly of organic matter such as decomposing animals and plants and minerals the most common sand found throughout the world is made up of quartz or silicon dioxide see full answer filed under geology q what causes chemical weathering a chemical weathering is the process by which a material breaks down into its component elements through the action of a chemical agent this type of weathering requires precise temperature conditions and the presence of a chemicallyladen fluid substances capable of causing chemical weathering include water and acids see full answer filed under geology q what is a minecut diamond a minecut diamonds are typically square or slightly oval and have a deeper crown and pavilion or top and bottom than modern stones mine cut does not refer to the place the diamond was faceted but rather to its overall shape and brilliance see full answer filed under geology q how are minerals formed a minerals are formed under a variety of conditions including when molten materials cool when liquids evaporate or cool and under high temperatures and pressures minerals are found in the earths crust and mantle and many were created when feldspar and quartz reacted with other materials during the formation of the planet see full answer filed under geology q how do fossil fuels form a fossil fuels are formed the gradual accumulation of organic remains on the sea floor as the accumulation rate increases the organic remains are subjected to heat and pressure which leads to fossilfuel formation see full answer filed under geology explore earth science atmosphere earthquakes erosion  weathering geology landforms layers of the earth plate tectonics soil tsunamis volcanoes

httpwwwbasfibercomsrcgeotextilepdf  reforcetech products  minibars™ minibars™  basalt frp macrofiber by reforcetech  unique new macrofiber made from mm thin basalt frp wires are available in long mm lengths for concrete and short mm for grout and mortar mixes  in contrast to microfiber that is used primarily for shrinkage crack control during curing at early ages these macrofibers will significantly enhance both flexural tensile fts and average residual strength ars often allowing the complete elimination of wwr mesh and light structural rebar  we call it “prereinforced™” concrete  compared to steel fiber minibars™ can be mixed at much higher dosages and still be pumped without clogging equipment  finishing without exposing the fibers is also easy as they stay suspended in the matrix below the surface  in addition to concrete slabs on grade or structure minibar™ mixes have been used very successfully in a variety of wall applications including castinplace and precast architectural facades insulated wall panels structural shear walls and privacy barriers  any concrete in an exposed or marine environment is a prime use for minibar™ reinforced concrete  accelerated aging tests show high resistance to both alkaline and acid environments  unlike steel fibers minibars™ will never rust and cause aesthetic or structural problems  projects using minibars™ have shown up to  savings in overall cost when considering both materials and labor  the cross section of the members can often be reduced because concrete cover normally required for steel is not necessary  there is no labor to fabricate and place reinforcing just pour or pump the minibar™ prereinforced™ concrete in the forms and finish  basbar™ basalt frp reinforcing bars by reforcetech  this nonmetallic rebar is twice as strong as steel but only  of the weight so smaller bars can be used and shipping costs are greatly reduced  reforcetech uses a new manufacturing process that is certified
