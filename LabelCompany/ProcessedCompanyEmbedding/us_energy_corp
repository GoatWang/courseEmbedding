considering total use the us ranks seventh in energy consumption percapita after canada and a number of small nations not included is the significant amount of energy used overseas in the production of retail and industrial goods consumed in the us the majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels in  data showed  of the nations energy came from petroleum  from coal and  from natural gas nuclear power supplied  and renewable energy supplied  which was mainly from hydroelectric dams and biomass but also included other renewable sources such as wind power geothermal and solar energy energy consumption has increased at a faster rate than domestic energy production over the last fifty years in the us when they were roughly equal this difference is now largely met through imports according to the energy information administrations statistics the percapita energy consumption in the us has been somewhat consistent from the s to today the average has been  million british thermal units btus per person from  to  one explanation suggested for this is that the energy required to produce the increase in us consumption of manufactured equipment cars and other goods has been shifted to other countries producing and transporting those goods to the us with a corresponding shift of green house gases and pollution in comparison the world average has increased from  in  to  million

vertical axis is in quadrillion btu from its founding until the late th century the united states was a largely agrarian country with abundant forests during this period energy consumption overwhelmingly focused on readily available firewood rapid industrialization of the economy urbanization and the growth of railroads led to increased use of coal and by  it had eclipsed wood as the nations primary energy source coal remained dominant for the next seven decades but by  it was surpassed in turn by both petroleum and natural gas in  coal consumption was the highest it has ever been with coal mostly being used to generate electricity natural gas which is cleanerburning and more easily transportable has replaced coal as the preferred source of heating in homes businesses and industrial furnaces although total energy use increased by approximately a factor of  between  and  energy use per capita increased only by a factor of four as of  united states per capita energy use had declined to  kilograms of oilequivalent  less than  and through  most recent available is at levels not seen since s usage levels at the beginning of the th century petroleum was a minor resource used to manufacture lubricants and fuel for kerosene and oil lamps one hundred years later it had become the preeminent energy source for the us and the rest of the world this rise closely paralleled the emergence of the automobile as a major force in american culture and the economy while petroleum is also used as a source for plastics and other chemicals and powers various industrial processes today twothirds of oil consumption in the us is in the form of its derived transportation fuels oils unique qualities for transportation fuels in terms of energy content cost of production and speed of refueling all contributed to it being used over other fuels in june  the american energy innovation council a group which includes bill gates founder of microsoft jeffrey r immelt chief executive of general electric and john doerr has urged the government to more than triple spending on energy research and development to  billion a year mr gates endorsed the administrations goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  percent by  but said that was not possible with todays technology or politicism he said that the only way to find such disruptive new technology was to pour large sums of money at the problem the group notes that the federal government spends less than  billion a year on energy research and development not counting onetime stimulus projects about  billion is spent

electricity usage by city  measured in kilowatt hours per customer household energy use varies significantly across the united states an average home in the pacific region consisting of california oregon and washington consumes  less energy than a home in the south central region some of the regional differences can be explained by climate the heavily populated coastal areas of the pacific states experience generally mild winters and summers reducing the need for both home heating and air conditioning the warm humid climates of the south central and south atlantic regions lead to higher electricity usage while the cold winters experienced in the northeast and north central regions result in much higher consumption of natural gas and heating oil the state with the lowest per capita energy use is new york at  million btuyr and the highest is wyoming at slightly over  billion btuyr other regional differences stem from energy efficiency measures taken at the local and state levels california has some of the strictest environmental laws and building codes in the country leading its perhousehold energy consumption to be lower than all other states except hawaii the landuse decisions of cities and towns also explain some of the regional differences in energy use townhouses are more energy efficient than singlefamily homes because less heat for example is wasted per person similarly areas with more homes in a compact neighborhood encourage walking biking and transit thereby reducing transportation energy use a  us epa study found that multifamily homes in urban

oiledit further information oil megaprojects  for most of the twentieth century and the early part of the twentyfirst century the majority of energy consumed has been from oil  fossil fuel provided  of the worlds energy in  with oil the largest contribution the united states became a world power in the early th century as they increased development of oil production and influenced world oil reserves for growth and development as the th century developed petroleum gained increasing importance by providing heating and power to the commercial and industrial sectors oil was also used in transportation first for railroads and later for motor vehicles as automobiles became more affordable demand for oil quickly rose since the rise of the automobile industry oil price demand and production have all increased from  to  fuel was directly correlated with gross national product gnp oil shocks have often coincided with recessions and the government has responded to oil shocks with a variety of methods in the s oil prices were peaking and many commentators believed that oil supplies were running out congress was confronted by requests to augment supplies so a generous depletion allowance was enacted for producers in  which increased investment returns substantially this change induced additional exploration activity and subsequently the discovery of large new oil reservoirs the next decade the situation was reversed with prices low and dropping this led to demands for more orderly competition and set minimum oil prices rather than repealing the previous policies enacted in the s congress enacted a pricesupport system similar cycles have occurred in the s and s priceedit with the exception of one every us recession since world war ii experienced a sharp increase in the price of oil this correlation strongly signifies the us dependency of oil for the economy as well as oils importance in us development for most of the time since the war many of the key cases of crude oil price increases in the postwar period were associated with political upheaval from oil rich countries domestic production and consumption were outpaced by us demand toward the end of the s and middle eastern nations gained a significant amount of political leverage in controlling prices based on their production price increases have been directly related to increased investment and subsequent production in oil following world war ii european reconstruction was the primary objective of the united states economy and investment eventually rose after a longterm price increase at the end of the war during the s there were strikes by oil workers production restrictions imposed by the texas railroad commission as well as the suez crisis and korean war—all creating steep price increases with prices only falling after production was able to meet demand peak oil in the united states resulted in a definite decline of us reserves and even more strikes by oil workers additional singular events such as the opec embargo the rupture of the transarabian pipeline and iranian nationalization of the oil industry led to further price increases that were never before seen each case was followed by a marked recession in the us economy in  oil prices rose briefly to as high as barrel and us gasoline prices jumped from  to gallon in  leading to a search for alternate sources and by  less than half of us oil consumption was imported however as of january  the price of oil has collapsed to around barrel crude oil prices to gas prices consumption and productionedit in the twentieth century oil production became of more value as the us industrialized and developed commercial transportation such as railroads and motor vehicles furthermore oil consumption also increased due to electricity after electricity oil became more important in commercial manufacturing and residential sectors such as heating and cooking therefore during this period the growth of oil consumption indicates that the united states was becoming dependent on oil and it aided the growth of the domestic oil industry however us oil domestic production could not cover the growing demand in the us market which led the us to look for a new supply internationally us consumption of oil increased  between  and  followed by another increase of  in  the first shock of the transportation era occurred in  and lasted for about a year the shortage of oil devastated the entire west coast with hourlong lines for gasoline and in many places fuel was not available for at least a week finally big production from texas california and oklahoma took the shortage of oil away causing oil prices to fall  between  and  the great depression in  was a time with growing supply and falling demand causing the price of oil to decrease about  from  to  toward the end of world war ii the automotive era settled rapidly and the us demand of oil increased  between  and  while motor vehicle registrations increased by  around  demand of oil exceeded supply of oil leading the us to start importing oil therefore the us quickly became a major importer of oil instead of being the major exporter in  due to a strike by us oil refinery workers the united states and the united kingdom cut  of fuel delivery to civilian flights while canada postponed all private flights until the s the price of oil was relatively stable and the world market could cover the excess demand of oil in the us however in  the price of oil increased due to the arab oil embargo against the us following united states support of israel in the yom kippur war during that time arab oil producers reduced production mbd for two months  of global output during this time people reduced their consumption of oil by turning down thermostats and carpooling to work which together with the lower demand due to the  recession resulted in a reduction in oil consumption after the crisis of  price of oil increased again between  and  due to the iranian revolution this crisis was related to political instability in a major oilexporting region during this period oil consumption decreased due to new efficiency cars at that time were developed so less oil was required and industrialization was also advanced to reduce the consumption of oil this led to a decline in us demand of oil and reduced the amount of international imports the last energy crises in the us occurred in  this occurred because iraq invaded kuwait similar to the previous crisis price of oil increased and oil consumption decreased but by a smaller amount and had a smaller effect in   of petroleum consumption in the us was for transportation approximately  of transportation consumption was gasoline today us is still dependent on oil as oil is an important player socially economically and politically us demand of oil is increasing exponentially causing the us to continue to rely on foreign countries policyedit regulation of the oil market has been a major player in oil history policies affect the market in a variety of ways such as price production consumption supply and demand the oil market has a history of booms and troughs which caused producers to demand government intervention many times this government involvement only made the situation worse and many of the regulations were quickly ruled illegal and removed before world war ii many of the problems within the oil market were related to changing prices during the s oil prices were beginning to peak leading to fears of oil depletion in response to these fears during coolidges term congress enacted a depletion allowance to producers which led to a surge of investment in the oil business and the discovery of many new large oil reservoirs the next decade consisted of falling prices due to the new investment and overproduction the declining prices led producers to demand some form of price support system one example of how prices were propped up was a prorationing order made by the texas railroad commission which restricted oil production and increased price this order was soon ruled illegal by federal district court in  the s was the beginning of large federal intervention in the oil industry and began with the creation of the national industrial recovery act in  this act allowed for natural price competition instead of agreements between the major producers however this act was ruled unconstitutional in  while the time before world war ii was filled with issues regarding price the post war era consisted of increasing oil imports partly due to the price support established during the s and s the artificially high domestic prices led to a surge of imports from lower priced foreign producers in  a clause was added to the reciprocal trade act amendments which gave the president the power to limit imports of a specific commodity if that particular commodity was harmful to the security of the nation this clause allowed eisenhower to enact oil import quotas in  which ultimately caused international oil prices to decline these import quotas restricted international oil companies from the us market and led them to form opec during the s richard nixon put in place many phrases of price controls after many new regulations that altered the original price control system president carter eventually began removing these controls in  during the carter administration in response to an energy crisis and hostile iranian and soviet union relations president jimmy carter announced the carter doctrine which declared that any interference with u s interests in the persian gulf would be considered an attack on us vital interests ronald reagan later expanded this doctrine since the s the oil market has been free of most regulations electrical

btu per kwh a factor of  btukwh was used for nuclear and  btukwh for renewable energy for  to reflect how much oil would be required this inflates the reported total energy consumption and roughly triples the apparent share from nonfossil fuel sources as oil is less important this adjustment may be removed as is largely the case in other countries international cooperationedit president barack

industrial goods consumed in the us the majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels in  data showed  of the nations energy came from petroleum  from coal and  from natural gas nuclear power supplied  and renewable energy supplied  which was mainly from hydroelectric dams and biomass but also included other renewable sources such as wind power geothermal and solar energy energy consumption has increased at a faster rate than domestic energy production over the last fifty years in the us when they were roughly equal this difference is now largely met through imports according to the energy information administrations statistics the percapita energy consumption in the us has been somewhat consistent from the s to today the average has been  million british thermal units btus per person from  to  one explanation suggested for this is that the energy required to produce the increase in us consumption of manufactured equipment cars and other goods has been shifted to other countries producing and transporting those goods to the us with a corresponding shift of green house gases and pollution in comparison the world average has increased from  in  to  million btus

vertical axis is in quadrillion btu from its founding until the late th century the united states was a largely agrarian country with abundant forests during this period energy consumption overwhelmingly focused on readily available firewood rapid industrialization of the economy urbanization and the growth of railroads led to increased use of coal and by  it had eclipsed wood as the nations primary energy source coal remained dominant for the next seven decades but by  it was surpassed in turn by both petroleum and natural gas in  coal consumption was the highest it has ever been with coal mostly being used to generate electricity natural gas which is cleanerburning and more easily transportable has replaced coal as the preferred source of heating in homes businesses and industrial furnaces although total energy use increased by approximately a factor of  between  and  energy use per capita increased only by a factor of four as of  united states per capita energy use had declined to  kilograms of oilequivalent  less than  and through  most recent available is at levels not seen since s usage levels at the beginning of the th century petroleum was a minor resource used to manufacture lubricants and fuel for kerosene and oil lamps one hundred years later it had become the preeminent energy source for the us and the rest of the world this rise closely paralleled the emergence of the automobile as a major force in american culture and the economy while petroleum is also used as a source for plastics and other chemicals and powers various industrial processes today twothirds of oil consumption in the us is in the form of its derived transportation fuels oils unique qualities for transportation fuels in terms of energy content cost of production and speed of refueling all contributed to it being used over other fuels in june  the american energy innovation council a group which includes bill gates founder of microsoft jeffrey r immelt chief executive of general electric and john doerr has urged the government to more than triple spending on energy research and development to  billion a year mr gates endorsed the administrations goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  percent by  but said that was not possible with todays technology or politicism he said that the only way to find such disruptive new technology was to pour large sums of money at the problem the group notes that the federal government spends less than  billion a year on energy research and development not counting onetime stimulus projects about  billion is spent annually on health research and more than  billion on military r d they advocate a jump in spending on basic energy research us co emissions have dropped about  per year through greater efficiency and

electricity usage by city  measured in kilowatt hours per customer household energy use varies significantly across the united states an average home in the pacific region consisting of california oregon and washington consumes  less energy than a home in the south central region some of the regional differences can be explained by climate the heavily populated coastal areas of the pacific states experience generally mild winters and summers reducing the need for both home heating and air conditioning the warm humid climates of the south central and south atlantic regions lead to higher electricity usage while the cold winters experienced in the northeast and north central regions result in much higher consumption of natural gas and heating oil the state with the lowest per capita energy use is new york at  million btuyr and the highest is wyoming at slightly over  billion btuyr other regional differences stem from energy efficiency measures taken at the local and state levels california has some of the strictest environmental laws and building codes in the country leading its perhousehold energy consumption to be lower than all other states except hawaii the landuse decisions of cities and towns also explain some of the regional differences in energy use townhouses are more energy efficient than singlefamily homes because less heat for example is wasted per person similarly areas with more homes in a compact neighborhood encourage walking biking and transit thereby reducing transportation energy use a  us epa study found that multifamily homes in urban

exploration in the united states according to president barack obama studies suggest that if there is enough political will it is feasible to supply the total united states with  renewable energy by  oiledit further information oil megaprojects  for most of the twentieth century and the early part of the twentyfirst century the majority of energy consumed has been from oil  fossil fuel provided  of the worlds energy in  with oil the largest contribution the united states became a world power in the early th century as they increased development of oil production and influenced world oil reserves for growth and development as the th century developed petroleum gained increasing importance by providing heating and power to the commercial and industrial sectors oil was also used in transportation first for railroads and later for motor vehicles as automobiles became more affordable demand for oil quickly rose since the rise of the automobile industry oil price demand and production have all increased from  to  fuel was directly correlated with gross national product gnp oil shocks have often coincided with recessions and the government has responded to oil shocks with a variety of methods in the s oil prices were peaking and many commentators believed that oil supplies were running out congress was confronted by requests to augment supplies so a generous depletion allowance was enacted for producers in  which increased investment returns substantially this change induced additional exploration activity and subsequently the discovery of large new oil reservoirs the next decade the situation was reversed with prices low and dropping this led to demands for more orderly competition and set minimum oil prices rather than repealing the previous policies enacted in the s congress enacted a pricesupport system similar cycles have occurred in the s and s priceedit with the exception of one every us recession since world war ii experienced a sharp increase in the price of oil this correlation strongly signifies the us dependency of oil for the economy as well as oils importance in us development for most of the time since the war many of the key cases of crude oil price increases in the postwar period were associated with political upheaval from oil rich countries domestic production and consumption were outpaced by us demand toward the end of the s and middle eastern nations gained a significant amount of political leverage in controlling prices based on their production price increases have been directly related to increased investment and subsequent production in oil following world war ii european reconstruction was the primary objective of the united states economy and investment eventually rose after a longterm price increase at the end of the war during the s there were strikes by oil workers production restrictions imposed by the texas railroad commission as well as the suez crisis and korean war—all creating steep price increases with prices only falling after production was able to meet demand peak oil in the united states resulted in a definite decline of us reserves and even more strikes by oil workers additional singular events such as the opec embargo the rupture of the transarabian pipeline and iranian nationalization of the oil industry led to further price increases that were never before seen each case was followed by a marked recession in the us economy in  oil prices rose briefly to as high as barrel and us gasoline prices jumped from  to gallon in  leading to a search for alternate sources and by  less than half of us oil consumption was imported however as of january  the price of oil has collapsed to around barrel crude oil prices to gas prices consumption and productionedit in the twentieth century oil production became of more value as the us industrialized and developed commercial transportation such as railroads and motor vehicles furthermore oil consumption also increased due to electricity after electricity oil became more important in commercial manufacturing and residential sectors such as heating and cooking therefore during this period the growth of oil consumption indicates that the united states was becoming dependent on oil and it aided the growth of the domestic oil industry however us oil domestic production could not cover the growing demand in the us market which led the us to look for a new supply internationally us consumption of oil increased  between  and  followed by another increase of  in  the first shock of the transportation era occurred in  and lasted for about a year the shortage of oil devastated the entire west coast with hourlong lines for gasoline and in many places fuel was not available for at least a week finally big production from texas california and oklahoma took the shortage of oil away causing oil prices to fall  between  and  the great depression in  was a time with growing supply and falling demand causing the price of oil to decrease about  from  to  toward the end of world war ii the automotive era settled rapidly and the us demand of oil increased  between  and  while motor vehicle registrations increased by  around  demand of oil exceeded supply of oil leading the us to start importing oil therefore the us quickly became a major importer of oil instead of being the major exporter in  due to a strike by us oil refinery workers the united states and the united kingdom cut  of fuel delivery to civilian flights while canada postponed all private flights until the s the price of oil was relatively stable and the world market could cover the excess demand of oil in the us however in  the price of oil increased due to the arab oil embargo against the us following united states support of israel in the yom kippur war during that time arab oil producers reduced production mbd for two months  of global output during this time people reduced their consumption of oil by turning down thermostats and carpooling to work which together with the lower demand due to the  recession resulted in a reduction in oil consumption after the crisis of  price of oil increased again between  and  due to the iranian revolution this crisis was related to political instability in a major oilexporting region during this period oil consumption decreased due to new efficiency cars at that time were developed so less oil was required and industrialization was also advanced to reduce the consumption of oil this led to a decline in us demand of oil and reduced the amount of international imports the last energy crises in the us occurred in  this occurred because iraq invaded kuwait similar to the previous crisis price of oil increased and oil consumption decreased but by a smaller amount and had a smaller effect in   of petroleum consumption in the us was for transportation approximately  of transportation consumption was gasoline today us is still dependent on oil as oil is an important player socially economically and politically us demand of oil is increasing exponentially causing the us to continue to rely on foreign countries policyedit regulation of the oil market has been a major player in oil history policies affect the market in a variety of ways such as price production consumption supply and demand the oil market has a history of booms and troughs which caused producers to demand government intervention many times this government involvement only made the situation worse and many of the regulations were quickly ruled illegal and removed before world war ii many of the problems within the oil market were related to changing prices during the s oil prices were beginning to peak leading to fears of oil depletion in response to these fears during coolidges term congress enacted a depletion allowance to producers which led to a surge of investment in the oil business and the discovery of many new large oil reservoirs the next decade consisted of falling prices due to the new investment and overproduction the declining prices led producers to demand some form of price support system one example of how prices were propped up was a prorationing order made by the texas railroad commission which restricted oil production and increased price this order was soon ruled illegal by federal district court in  the s was the beginning of large federal intervention in the oil industry and began with the creation of the national industrial recovery act in  this act allowed for natural price competition instead of agreements between the major producers however this act was ruled unconstitutional in  while the time before world war ii was filled with issues regarding price the post war era consisted of increasing oil imports partly due to the price support established during the s and s the artificially high domestic prices led to a surge of imports from lower priced foreign producers in  a clause was added to the reciprocal trade act amendments which gave the president the power to limit imports of a specific commodity if that particular commodity was harmful to the security of the nation this clause allowed eisenhower to enact oil import quotas in  which ultimately caused international oil prices to decline these import quotas restricted international oil companies from the us market and led them to form opec during the s richard nixon put in place many phrases of price controls after many new regulations that altered the original price control system president carter eventually began removing these controls in  during the carter administration in response to an energy crisis and hostile iranian and soviet union relations president jimmy carter announced the carter doctrine which declared that any interference with u s interests in the persian gulf would be considered an attack on us vital interests ronald reagan later expanded this doctrine since the s the oil market has been free of most regulations electrical

industrial goods consumed in the us the majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels in  data showed  of the nations energy came from petroleum  from coal and  from natural gas nuclear power supplied  and renewable energy supplied  which was mainly from hydroelectric dams and biomass but also included other renewable sources such as wind power geothermal and solar energy energy consumption has increased at a faster rate than domestic energy production over the last fifty years in the us when they were roughly equal this difference is now largely met through imports according to the energy information administrations statistics the percapita energy consumption in the us has been somewhat consistent from the s to today the average has been  million british thermal units btus per person from  to  one explanation suggested for this is that the energy required to produce the increase in us consumption of manufactured equipment cars and other goods has been shifted to other countries producing and transporting those goods to the us with a corresponding shift of green house gases and pollution in comparison the world average has increased from  in  to  million btus

vertical axis is in quadrillion btu from its founding until the late th century the united states was a largely agrarian country with abundant forests during this period energy consumption overwhelmingly focused on readily available firewood rapid industrialization of the economy urbanization and the growth of railroads led to increased use of coal and by  it had eclipsed wood as the nations primary energy source coal remained dominant for the next seven decades but by  it was surpassed in turn by both petroleum and natural gas in  coal consumption was the highest it has ever been with coal mostly being used to generate electricity natural gas which is cleanerburning and more easily transportable has replaced coal as the preferred source of heating in homes businesses and industrial furnaces although total energy use increased by approximately a factor of  between  and  energy use per capita increased only by a factor of four as of  united states per capita energy use had declined to  kilograms of oilequivalent  less than  and through  most recent available is at levels not seen since s usage levels at the beginning of the th century petroleum was a minor resource used to manufacture lubricants and fuel for kerosene and oil lamps one hundred years later it had become the preeminent energy source for the us and the rest of the world this rise closely paralleled the emergence of the automobile as a major force in american culture and the economy while petroleum is also used as a source for plastics and other chemicals and powers various industrial processes today twothirds of oil consumption in the us is in the form of its derived transportation fuels oils unique qualities for transportation fuels in terms of energy content cost of production and speed of refueling all contributed to it being used over other fuels in june  the american energy innovation council a group which includes bill gates founder of microsoft jeffrey r immelt chief executive of general electric and john doerr has urged the government to more than triple spending on energy research and development to  billion a year mr gates endorsed the administrations goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  percent by  but said that was not possible with todays technology or politicism he said that the only way to find such disruptive new technology was to pour large sums of money at the problem the group notes that the federal government spends less than  billion a year on energy research and development not counting onetime stimulus projects about  billion is spent

electricity usage by city  measured in kilowatt hours per customer household energy use varies significantly across the united states an average home in the pacific region consisting of california oregon and washington consumes  less energy than a home in the south central region some of the regional differences can be explained by climate the heavily populated coastal areas of the pacific states experience generally mild winters and summers reducing the need for both home heating and air conditioning the warm humid climates of the south central and south atlantic regions lead to higher electricity usage while the cold winters experienced in the northeast and north central regions result in much higher consumption of natural gas and heating oil the state with the lowest per capita energy use is new york at  million btuyr and the highest is wyoming at slightly over  billion btuyr other regional differences stem from energy efficiency measures taken at the local and state levels california has some of the strictest environmental laws and building codes in the country leading its perhousehold energy consumption to be lower than all other states except hawaii the landuse decisions of cities and towns also explain some of the regional differences in energy use townhouses are more energy efficient than singlefamily homes because less heat for example is wasted per person similarly areas with more homes in a compact neighborhood encourage walking biking and transit thereby reducing transportation energy use a  us epa study found that multifamily homes in urban neighborhoods with wellinsulated buildings and fuelefficient cars can save more than  of the energy used by conventionally built singlefamily houses in suburban areas with standard cars renewable

exploration in the united states according to president barack obama studies suggest that if there is enough political will it is feasible to supply the total united states with  renewable energy by  oiledit further information oil megaprojects  for most of the twentieth century and the early part of the twentyfirst century the majority of energy consumed has been from oil  fossil fuel provided  of the worlds energy in  with oil the largest contribution the united states became a world power in the early th century as they increased development of oil production and influenced world oil reserves for growth and development as the th century developed petroleum gained increasing importance by providing heating and power to the commercial and industrial sectors oil was also used in transportation first for railroads and later for motor vehicles as automobiles became more affordable demand for oil quickly rose since the rise of the automobile industry oil price demand and production have all increased from  to  fuel was directly correlated with gross national product gnp oil shocks have often coincided with recessions and the government has responded to oil shocks with a variety of methods in the s oil prices were peaking and many commentators believed that oil supplies were running out congress was confronted by requests to augment supplies so a generous depletion allowance was enacted for producers in  which increased investment returns substantially this change induced additional exploration activity and subsequently the discovery of large new oil reservoirs the next decade the situation was reversed with prices low and dropping this led to demands for more orderly competition and set minimum oil prices rather than repealing the previous policies enacted in the s congress enacted a pricesupport system similar cycles have occurred in the s and s priceedit with the exception of one every us recession since world war ii experienced a sharp increase in the price of oil this correlation strongly signifies the us dependency of oil for the economy as well as oils importance in us development for most of the time since the war many of the key cases of crude oil price increases in the postwar period were associated with political upheaval from oil rich countries domestic production and consumption were outpaced by us demand toward the end of the s and middle eastern nations gained a significant amount of political leverage in controlling prices based on their production price increases have been directly related to increased investment and subsequent production in oil following world war ii european reconstruction was the primary objective of the united states economy and investment eventually rose after a longterm price increase at the end of the war during the s there were strikes by oil workers production restrictions imposed by the texas railroad commission as well as the suez crisis and korean war—all creating steep price increases with prices only falling after production was able to meet demand peak oil in the united states resulted in a definite decline of us reserves and even more strikes by oil workers additional singular events such as the opec embargo the rupture of the transarabian pipeline and iranian nationalization of the oil industry led to further price increases that were never before seen each case was followed by a marked recession in the us economy in  oil prices rose briefly to as high as barrel and us gasoline prices jumped from  to gallon in  leading to a search for alternate sources and by  less than half of us oil consumption was imported however as of january  the price of oil has collapsed to around barrel crude oil prices to gas prices consumption and productionedit in the twentieth century oil production became of more value as the us industrialized and developed commercial transportation such as railroads and motor vehicles furthermore oil consumption also increased due to electricity after electricity oil became more important in commercial manufacturing and residential sectors such as heating and cooking therefore during this period the growth of oil consumption indicates that the united states was becoming dependent on oil and it aided the growth of the domestic oil industry however us oil domestic production could not cover the growing demand in the us market which led the us to look for a new supply internationally us consumption of oil increased  between  and  followed by another increase of  in  the first shock of the transportation era occurred in  and lasted for about a year the shortage of oil devastated the entire west coast with hourlong lines for gasoline and in many places fuel was not available for at least a week finally big production from texas california and oklahoma took the shortage of oil away causing oil prices to fall  between  and  the great depression in  was a time with growing supply and falling demand causing the price of oil to decrease about  from  to  toward the end of world war ii the automotive era settled rapidly and the us demand of oil increased  between  and  while motor vehicle registrations increased by  around  demand of oil exceeded supply of oil leading the us to start importing oil therefore the us quickly became a major importer of oil instead of being the major exporter in  due to a strike by us oil refinery workers the united states and the united kingdom cut  of fuel delivery to civilian flights while canada postponed all private flights until the s the price of oil was relatively stable and the world market could cover the excess demand of oil in the us however in  the price of oil increased due to the arab oil embargo against the us following united states support of israel in the yom kippur war during that time arab oil producers reduced production mbd for two months  of global output during this time people reduced their consumption of oil by turning down thermostats and carpooling to work which together with the lower demand due to the  recession resulted in a reduction in oil consumption after the crisis of  price of oil increased again between  and  due to the iranian revolution this crisis was related to political instability in a major oilexporting region during this period oil consumption decreased due to new efficiency cars at that time were developed so less oil was required and industrialization was also advanced to reduce the consumption of oil this led to a decline in us demand of oil and reduced the amount of international imports the last energy crises in the us occurred in  this occurred because iraq invaded kuwait similar to the previous crisis price of oil increased and oil consumption decreased but by a smaller amount and had a smaller effect in   of petroleum consumption in the us was for transportation approximately  of transportation consumption was gasoline today us is still dependent on oil as oil is an important player socially economically and politically us demand of oil is increasing exponentially causing the us to continue to rely on foreign countries policyedit regulation of the oil market has been a major player in oil history policies affect the market in a variety of ways such as price production consumption supply and demand the oil market has a history of booms and troughs which caused producers to demand government intervention many times this government involvement only made the situation worse and many of the regulations were quickly ruled illegal and removed before world war ii many of the problems within the oil market were related to changing prices during the s oil prices were beginning to peak leading to fears of oil depletion in response to these fears during coolidges term congress enacted a depletion allowance to producers which led to a surge of investment in the oil business and the discovery of many new large oil reservoirs the next decade consisted of falling prices due to the new investment and overproduction the declining prices led producers to demand some form of price support system one example of how prices were propped up was a prorationing order made by the texas railroad commission which restricted oil production and increased price this order was soon ruled illegal by federal district court in  the s was the beginning of large federal intervention in the oil industry and began with the creation of the national industrial recovery act in  this act allowed for natural price competition instead of agreements between the major producers however this act was ruled unconstitutional in  while the time before world war ii was filled with issues regarding price the post war era consisted of increasing oil imports partly due to the price support established during the s and s the artificially high domestic prices led to a surge of imports from lower priced foreign producers in  a clause was added to the reciprocal trade act amendments which gave the president the power to limit imports of a specific commodity if that particular commodity was harmful to the security of the nation this clause allowed eisenhower to enact oil import quotas in  which ultimately caused international oil prices to decline these import quotas restricted international oil companies from the us market and led them to form opec during the s richard nixon put in place many phrases of price controls after many new regulations that altered the original price control system president carter eventually began removing these controls in  during the carter administration in response to an energy crisis and hostile iranian and soviet union relations president jimmy carter announced the carter doctrine which declared that any interference with u s interests in the persian gulf would be considered an attack on us vital interests ronald reagan later expanded this doctrine since the s the oil market has been free of most regulations electrical

btu per kwh a factor of  btukwh was used for nuclear and  btukwh for renewable energy for  to reflect how much oil would be required this inflates the reported total energy consumption and roughly triples the apparent share from nonfossil fuel sources as oil is less important this adjustment may be removed as is largely the case in other countries international cooperationedit president barack obama and chinas president hu jintao announced a farreaching package of measures to strengthen cooperation between the united states and china on clean energy  november  the presidents began by establishing a uschina clean energy research center to facilitate joint research and development of renewable energy technologies by scientists from both countries the center will be supported by  million in public and private funds over the next five years split evenly between the partners initial research priorities will be developing better energy efficiency by way of things like electric vehiclescitation needed the two countries will also leverage private sector resources to develop clean energy projects in china through the uschina energy cooperation program ecp more than  companies are founding members of the program the ecp will include collaborative projects involving renewable energy smart grids electric vehicles green buildings combined heat and power and energy efficiency

industrial goods consumed in the us the majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels in  data showed  of the nations energy came from petroleum  from coal and  from natural gas nuclear power supplied  and renewable energy supplied  which was mainly from hydroelectric dams and biomass but also included other renewable sources such as wind power geothermal and solar energy energy consumption has increased at a faster rate than domestic energy production over the last fifty years in the us when they were roughly equal this difference is now largely met through imports according to the energy information administrations statistics the percapita energy consumption in the us has been somewhat consistent from the s to today the average has been  million british thermal units btus per person from  to  one explanation suggested for this is that the energy required to produce the increase in us consumption of manufactured equipment cars and other goods has been shifted to other countries producing and transporting those goods to the us with a corresponding shift of green house gases and pollution in comparison the world average has increased from  in  to  million btus

vertical axis is in quadrillion btu from its founding until the late th century the united states was a largely agrarian country with abundant forests during this period energy consumption overwhelmingly focused on readily available firewood rapid industrialization of the economy urbanization and the growth of railroads led to increased use of coal and by  it had eclipsed wood as the nations primary energy source coal remained dominant for the next seven decades but by  it was surpassed in turn by both petroleum and natural gas in  coal consumption was the highest it has ever been with coal mostly being used to generate electricity natural gas which is cleanerburning and more easily transportable has replaced coal as the preferred source of heating in homes businesses and industrial furnaces although total energy use increased by approximately a factor of  between  and  energy use per capita increased only by a factor of four as of  united states per capita energy use had declined to  kilograms of oilequivalent  less than  and through  most recent available is at levels not seen since s usage levels at the beginning of the th century petroleum was a minor resource used to manufacture lubricants and fuel for kerosene and oil lamps one hundred years later it had become the preeminent energy source for the us and the rest of the world this rise closely paralleled the emergence of the automobile as a major force in american culture and the economy while petroleum is also used as a source for plastics and other chemicals and powers various industrial processes today twothirds of oil consumption in the us is in the form of its derived transportation fuels oils unique qualities for transportation fuels in terms of energy content cost of production and speed of refueling all contributed to it being used over other fuels in june  the american energy innovation council a group which includes bill gates founder of microsoft jeffrey r immelt chief executive of general electric and john doerr has urged the government to more than triple spending on energy research and development to  billion a year mr gates endorsed the administrations goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  percent by  but said that was not possible with todays technology or politicism he said that the only way to find such disruptive new technology was to pour large sums of money at the problem the group notes that the federal government spends less than  billion a year on energy research and development not counting onetime stimulus projects about  billion is spent

electricity usage by city  measured in kilowatt hours per customer household energy use varies significantly across the united states an average home in the pacific region consisting of california oregon and washington consumes  less energy than a home in the south central region some of the regional differences can be explained by climate the heavily populated coastal areas of the pacific states experience generally mild winters and summers reducing the need for both home heating and air conditioning the warm humid climates of the south central and south atlantic regions lead to higher electricity usage while the cold winters experienced in the northeast and north central regions result in much higher consumption of natural gas and heating oil the state with the lowest per capita energy use is new york at  million btuyr and the highest is wyoming at slightly over  billion btuyr other regional differences stem from energy efficiency measures taken at the local and state levels california has some of the strictest environmental laws and building codes in the country leading its perhousehold energy consumption to be lower than all other states except hawaii the landuse decisions of cities and towns also explain some of the regional differences in energy use townhouses are more energy efficient than singlefamily homes because less heat for example is wasted per person similarly areas with more homes in a compact neighborhood encourage walking biking and transit thereby reducing transportation energy use a  us epa study found that multifamily homes in urban

exploration in the united states according to president barack obama studies suggest that if there is enough political will it is feasible to supply the total united states with  renewable energy by  oiledit further information oil megaprojects  for most of the twentieth century and the early part of the twentyfirst century the majority of energy consumed has been from oil  fossil fuel provided  of the worlds energy in  with oil the largest contribution the united states became a world power in the early th century as they increased development of oil production and influenced world oil reserves for growth and development as the th century developed petroleum gained increasing importance by providing heating and power to the commercial and industrial sectors oil was also used in transportation first for railroads and later for motor vehicles as automobiles became more affordable demand for oil quickly rose since the rise of the automobile industry oil price demand and production have all increased from  to  fuel was directly correlated with gross national product gnp oil shocks have often coincided with recessions and the government has responded to oil shocks with a variety of methods in the s oil prices were peaking and many commentators believed that oil supplies were running out congress was confronted by requests to augment supplies so a generous depletion allowance was enacted for producers in  which increased investment returns substantially this change induced additional exploration activity and subsequently the discovery of large new oil reservoirs the next decade the situation was reversed with prices low and dropping this led to demands for more orderly competition and set minimum oil prices rather than repealing the previous policies enacted in the s congress enacted a pricesupport system similar cycles have occurred in the s and s priceedit with the exception of one every us recession since world war ii experienced a sharp increase in the price of oil this correlation strongly signifies the us dependency of oil for the economy as well as oils importance in us development for most of the time since the war many of the key cases of crude oil price increases in the postwar period were associated with political upheaval from oil rich countries domestic production and consumption were outpaced by us demand toward the end of the s and middle eastern nations gained a significant amount of political leverage in controlling prices based on their production price increases have been directly related to increased investment and subsequent production in oil following world war ii european reconstruction was the primary objective of the united states economy and investment eventually rose after a longterm price increase at the end of the war during the s there were strikes by oil workers production restrictions imposed by the texas railroad commission as well as the suez crisis and korean war—all creating steep price increases with prices only falling after production was able to meet demand peak oil in the united states resulted in a definite decline of us reserves and even more strikes by oil workers additional singular events such as the opec embargo the rupture of the transarabian pipeline and iranian nationalization of the oil industry led to further price increases that were never before seen each case was followed by a marked recession in the us economy in  oil prices rose briefly to as high as barrel and us gasoline prices jumped from  to gallon in  leading to a search for alternate sources and by  less than half of us oil consumption was imported however as of january  the price of oil has collapsed to around barrel crude oil prices to gas prices consumption and productionedit in the twentieth century oil production became of more value as the us industrialized and developed commercial transportation such as railroads and motor vehicles furthermore oil consumption also increased due to electricity after electricity oil became more important in commercial manufacturing and residential sectors such as heating and cooking therefore during this period the growth of oil consumption indicates that the united states was becoming dependent on oil and it aided the growth of the domestic oil industry however us oil domestic production could not cover the growing demand in the us market which led the us to look for a new supply internationally us consumption of oil increased  between  and  followed by another increase of  in  the first shock of the transportation era occurred in  and lasted for about a year the shortage of oil devastated the entire west coast with hourlong lines for gasoline and in many places fuel was not available for at least a week finally big production from texas california and oklahoma took the shortage of oil away causing oil prices to fall  between  and  the great depression in  was a time with growing supply and falling demand causing the price of oil to decrease about  from  to  toward the end of world war ii the automotive era settled rapidly and the us demand of oil increased  between  and  while motor vehicle registrations increased by  around  demand of oil exceeded supply of oil leading the us to start importing oil therefore the us quickly became a major importer of oil instead of being the major exporter in  due to a strike by us oil refinery workers the united states and the united kingdom cut  of fuel delivery to civilian flights while canada postponed all private flights until the s the price of oil was relatively stable and the world market could cover the excess demand of oil in the us however in  the price of oil increased due to the arab oil embargo against the us following united states support of israel in the yom kippur war during that time arab oil producers reduced production mbd for two months  of global output during this time people reduced their consumption of oil by turning down thermostats and carpooling to work which together with the lower demand due to the  recession resulted in a reduction in oil consumption after the crisis of  price of oil increased again between  and  due to the iranian revolution this crisis was related to political instability in a major oilexporting region during this period oil consumption decreased due to new efficiency cars at that time were developed so less oil was required and industrialization was also advanced to reduce the consumption of oil this led to a decline in us demand of oil and reduced the amount of international imports the last energy crises in the us occurred in  this occurred because iraq invaded kuwait similar to the previous crisis price of oil increased and oil consumption decreased but by a smaller amount and had a smaller effect in   of petroleum consumption in the us was for transportation approximately  of transportation consumption was gasoline today us is still dependent on oil as oil is an important player socially economically and politically us demand of oil is increasing exponentially causing the us to continue to rely on foreign countries policyedit regulation of the oil market has been a major player in oil history policies affect the market in a variety of ways such as price production consumption supply and demand the oil market has a history of booms and troughs which caused producers to demand government intervention many times this government involvement only made the situation worse and many of the regulations were quickly ruled illegal and removed before world war ii many of the problems within the oil market were related to changing prices during the s oil prices were beginning to peak leading to fears of oil depletion in response to these fears during coolidges term congress enacted a depletion allowance to producers which led to a surge of investment in the oil business and the discovery of many new large oil reservoirs the next decade consisted of falling prices due to the new investment and overproduction the declining prices led producers to demand some form of price support system one example of how prices were propped up was a prorationing order made by the texas railroad commission which restricted oil production and increased price this order was soon ruled illegal by federal district court in  the s was the beginning of large federal intervention in the oil industry and began with the creation of the national industrial recovery act in  this act allowed for natural price competition instead of agreements between the major producers however this act was ruled unconstitutional in  while the time before world war ii was filled with issues regarding price the post war era consisted of increasing oil imports partly due to the price support established during the s and s the artificially high domestic prices led to a surge of imports from lower priced foreign producers in  a clause was added to the reciprocal trade act amendments which gave the president the power to limit imports of a specific commodity if that particular commodity was harmful to the security of the nation this clause allowed eisenhower to enact oil import quotas in  which ultimately caused international oil prices to decline these import quotas restricted international oil companies from the us market and led them to form opec during the s richard nixon put in place many phrases of price controls after many new regulations that altered the original price control system president carter eventually began removing these controls in  during the carter administration in response to an energy crisis and hostile iranian and soviet union relations president jimmy carter announced the carter doctrine which declared that any interference with u s interests in the persian gulf would be considered an attack on us vital interests ronald reagan later expanded this doctrine since the s the oil market has been free of most regulations electrical

reported above from the annual energy review has been adjusted by a fossilfuel equivalency factor in order to estimate how much oil would be required to supply all of the energy used while there is  btu per kwh a factor of  btukwh was used for nuclear and  btukwh for renewable energy for  to reflect how much oil would be required this inflates the reported total energy consumption and roughly triples the apparent share from nonfossil fuel sources as oil is less important this adjustment may be removed as is largely the case in other countries international cooperationedit president barack

industrial goods consumed in the us the majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels in  data showed  of the nations energy came from petroleum  from coal and  from natural gas nuclear power supplied  and renewable energy supplied  which was mainly from hydroelectric dams and biomass but also included other renewable sources such as wind power geothermal and solar energy energy consumption has increased at a faster rate than domestic energy production over the last fifty years in the us when they were roughly equal this difference is now largely met through imports according to the energy information administrations statistics the percapita energy consumption in the us has been somewhat consistent from the s to today the average has been  million british thermal units btus per person from  to  one explanation suggested for this is that the energy required to produce the increase in us consumption of manufactured equipment cars and other goods has been shifted to other countries producing and transporting those goods to the us with a corresponding shift of green house gases and pollution in comparison the world average has increased from  in  to  million btus

vertical axis is in quadrillion btu from its founding until the late th century the united states was a largely agrarian country with abundant forests during this period energy consumption overwhelmingly focused on readily available firewood rapid industrialization of the economy urbanization and the growth of railroads led to increased use of coal and by  it had eclipsed wood as the nations primary energy source coal remained dominant for the next seven decades but by  it was surpassed in turn by both petroleum and natural gas in  coal consumption was the highest it has ever been with coal mostly being used to generate electricity natural gas which is cleanerburning and more easily transportable has replaced coal as the preferred source of heating in homes businesses and industrial furnaces although total energy use increased by approximately a factor of  between  and  energy use per capita increased only by a factor of four as of  united states per capita energy use had declined to  kilograms of oilequivalent  less than  and through  most recent available is at levels not seen since s usage levels at the beginning of the th century petroleum was a minor resource used to manufacture lubricants and fuel for kerosene and oil lamps one hundred years later it had become the preeminent energy source for the us and the rest of the world this rise closely paralleled the emergence of the automobile as a major force in american culture and the economy while petroleum is also used as a source for plastics and other chemicals and powers various industrial processes today twothirds of oil consumption in the us is in the form of its derived transportation fuels oils unique qualities for transportation fuels in terms of energy content cost of production and speed of refueling all contributed to it being used over other fuels in june  the american energy innovation council a group which includes bill gates founder of microsoft jeffrey r immelt chief executive of general electric and john doerr has urged the government to more than triple spending on energy research and development to  billion a year mr gates endorsed the administrations goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  percent by  but said that was not possible with todays technology or politicism he said that the only way to find such disruptive new technology was to pour large sums of money at the problem the group notes that the federal government spends less than  billion a year on energy research and development not counting onetime stimulus projects about  billion is spent

electricity usage by city  measured in kilowatt hours per customer household energy use varies significantly across the united states an average home in the pacific region consisting of california oregon and washington consumes  less energy than a home in the south central region some of the regional differences can be explained by climate the heavily populated coastal areas of the pacific states experience generally mild winters and summers reducing the need for both home heating and air conditioning the warm humid climates of the south central and south atlantic regions lead to higher electricity usage while the cold winters experienced in the northeast and north central regions result in much higher consumption of natural gas and heating oil the state with the lowest per capita energy use is new york at  million btuyr and the highest is wyoming at slightly over  billion btuyr other regional differences stem from energy efficiency measures taken at the local and state levels california has some of the strictest environmental laws and building codes in the country leading its perhousehold energy consumption to be lower than all other states except hawaii the landuse decisions of cities and towns also explain some of the regional differences in energy use townhouses are more energy efficient than singlefamily homes because less heat for example is wasted per person similarly areas with more homes in a compact neighborhood encourage walking biking and transit thereby reducing transportation energy use a  us epa study found that multifamily homes in urban

production have all increased from  to  fuel was directly correlated with gross national product gnp oil shocks have often coincided with recessions and the government has responded to oil shocks with a variety of methods in the s oil prices were peaking and many commentators believed that oil supplies were running out congress was confronted by requests to augment supplies so a generous depletion allowance was enacted for producers in  which increased investment returns substantially this change induced additional exploration activity and subsequently the discovery of large new oil reservoirs the next decade the situation was reversed with prices low and dropping this led to demands for more orderly competition and set minimum oil prices rather than repealing the previous policies enacted in the s congress enacted a pricesupport system similar cycles have occurred in the s and s priceedit with the exception of one every us recession since world war ii experienced a sharp increase in the price of oil this correlation strongly signifies the us dependency of oil for the economy as well as oils importance in us development for most of the time since the war many of the key cases of crude oil price increases in the postwar period were associated with political upheaval from oil rich countries domestic production and consumption were outpaced by us demand toward the end of the s and middle eastern nations gained a significant amount of political leverage in controlling prices based on their production price increases have been directly related to increased investment and subsequent production in oil following world war ii european reconstruction was the primary objective of the united states economy and investment eventually rose after a longterm price increase at the end of the war during the s there were strikes by oil workers production restrictions imposed by the texas railroad commission as well as the suez crisis and korean war—all creating steep price increases with prices only falling after production was able to meet demand peak oil in the united states resulted in a definite decline of us reserves and even more strikes by oil workers additional singular events such as the opec embargo the rupture of the transarabian pipeline and iranian nationalization of the oil industry led to further price increases that were never before seen each case was followed by a marked recession in the us economy in  oil prices rose briefly to as high as barrel and us gasoline prices jumped from  to gallon in  leading to a search for alternate sources and by  less than half of us oil consumption was imported however as of january  the price of oil has collapsed to around barrel crude oil prices to gas prices consumption and productionedit in the twentieth century oil production became of more value as the us industrialized and developed commercial transportation such as railroads and motor vehicles furthermore oil consumption also increased due to electricity after electricity oil became more important in commercial manufacturing and residential sectors such as heating and cooking therefore during this period the growth of oil consumption indicates that the united states was becoming dependent on oil and it aided the growth of the domestic oil industry however us oil domestic production could not cover the growing demand in the us market which led the us to look for a new supply internationally us consumption of oil increased  between  and  followed by another increase of  in  the first shock of the transportation era occurred in  and lasted for about a year the shortage of oil devastated the entire west coast with hourlong lines for gasoline and in many places fuel was not available for at least a week finally big production from texas california and oklahoma took the shortage of oil away causing oil prices to fall  between  and  the great depression in  was a time with growing supply and falling demand causing the price of oil to decrease about  from  to  toward the end of world war ii the automotive era settled rapidly and the us demand of oil increased  between  and  while motor vehicle registrations increased by  around  demand of oil exceeded supply of oil leading the us to start importing oil therefore the us quickly became a major importer of oil instead of being the major exporter in  due to a strike by us oil refinery workers the united states and the united kingdom cut  of fuel delivery to civilian flights while canada postponed all private flights until the s the price of oil was relatively stable and the world market could cover the excess demand of oil in the us however in  the price of oil increased due to the arab oil embargo against the us following united states support of israel in the yom kippur war during that time arab oil producers reduced production mbd for two months  of global output during this time people reduced their consumption of oil by turning down thermostats and carpooling to work which together with the lower demand due to the  recession resulted in a reduction in oil consumption after the crisis of  price of oil increased again between  and  due to the iranian revolution this crisis was related to political instability in a major oilexporting region during this period oil consumption decreased due to new efficiency cars at that time were developed so less oil was required and industrialization was also advanced to reduce the consumption of oil this led to a decline in us demand of oil and reduced the amount of international imports the last energy crises in the us occurred in  this occurred because iraq invaded kuwait similar to the previous crisis price of oil increased and oil consumption decreased but by a smaller amount and had a smaller effect in   of petroleum consumption in the us was for transportation approximately  of transportation consumption was gasoline today us is still dependent on oil as oil is an important player socially economically and politically us demand of oil is increasing exponentially causing the us to continue to rely on foreign countries policyedit regulation of the oil market has been a major player in oil history policies affect the market in a variety of ways such as price production consumption supply and demand the oil market has a history of booms and troughs which caused producers to demand government intervention many times this government involvement only made the situation worse and many of the regulations were quickly ruled illegal and removed before world war ii many of the problems within the oil market were related to changing prices during the s oil prices were beginning to peak leading to fears of oil depletion in response to these fears during coolidges term congress enacted a depletion allowance to producers which led to a surge of investment in the oil business and the discovery of many new large oil reservoirs the next decade consisted of falling prices due to the new investment and overproduction the declining prices led producers to demand some form of price support system one example of how prices were propped up was a prorationing order made by the texas railroad commission which restricted oil production and increased price this order was soon ruled illegal by federal district court in  the s was the beginning of large federal intervention in the oil industry and began with the creation of the national industrial recovery act in  this act allowed for natural price competition instead of agreements between the major producers however this act was ruled unconstitutional in  while the time before world war ii was filled with issues regarding price the post war era consisted of increasing oil imports partly due to the price support established during the s and s the artificially high domestic prices led to a surge of imports from lower priced foreign producers in  a clause was added to the reciprocal trade act amendments which gave the president the power to limit imports of a specific commodity if that particular commodity was harmful to the security of the nation this clause allowed eisenhower to enact oil import quotas in  which ultimately caused international oil prices to decline these import quotas restricted international oil companies from the us market and led them to form opec during the s richard nixon put in place many phrases of price controls after many new regulations that altered the original price control system president carter eventually began removing these controls in  during the carter administration in response to an energy crisis and hostile iranian and soviet union relations president jimmy carter announced the carter doctrine which declared that any interference with u s interests in the persian gulf would be considered an attack on us vital interests ronald reagan later expanded this doctrine since the s the oil market has been free of most regulations electrical

inaccurate it helped drive the debate to the national level and in  the us senate started a study of the energy consumption of server farms fossilfuel equivalencyedit the total energy consumption reported above from the annual energy review has been adjusted by a fossilfuel equivalency factor in order to estimate how much oil would be required to supply all of the energy used while there is  btu per kwh a factor of  btukwh was used for nuclear and  btukwh for renewable energy for  to reflect how much oil would be required this inflates the reported total energy consumption and roughly triples the apparent share from nonfossil fuel sources as oil is less important this adjustment may be removed as is largely the case in other countries international cooperationedit president barack

vertical axis is in quadrillion btu from its founding until the late th century the united states was a largely agrarian country with abundant forests during this period energy consumption overwhelmingly focused on readily available firewood rapid industrialization of the economy urbanization and the growth of railroads led to increased use of coal and by  it had eclipsed wood as the nations primary energy source coal remained dominant for the next seven decades but by  it was surpassed in turn by both petroleum and natural gas in  coal consumption was the highest it has ever been with coal mostly being used to generate electricity natural gas which is cleanerburning and more easily transportable has replaced coal as the preferred source of heating in homes businesses and industrial furnaces although total energy use increased by approximately a factor of  between  and  energy use per capita increased only by a factor of four as of  united states per capita energy use had declined to  kilograms of oilequivalent  less than  and through  most recent available is at levels not seen since s usage levels at the beginning of the th century petroleum was a minor resource used to manufacture lubricants and fuel for kerosene and oil lamps one hundred years later it had become the preeminent energy source for the us and the rest of the world this rise closely paralleled the emergence of the automobile as a major force in american culture and the economy while petroleum is also used as a source for plastics and other chemicals and powers various industrial processes today twothirds of oil consumption in the us is in the form of its derived transportation fuels oils unique qualities for transportation fuels in terms of energy content cost of production and speed

electricity usage by city  measured in kilowatt hours per customer household energy use varies significantly across the united states an average home in the pacific region consisting of california oregon and washington consumes  less energy than a home in the south central region some of the regional differences can be explained by climate the heavily populated coastal areas of the pacific states experience generally mild winters and summers reducing the need for both home heating and air conditioning the warm humid climates of the south central and south atlantic regions lead to higher electricity usage while the cold winters experienced in the northeast and north central regions result in much higher consumption of natural gas and heating oil the state with the lowest per capita energy use is new york at  million btuyr and the highest is wyoming at slightly over  billion btuyr other regional differences stem from energy efficiency measures taken at the local and state levels california has some of the strictest environmental laws and building codes in the country leading its perhousehold energy consumption to be lower than all other states except hawaii the landuse decisions of cities and towns also explain some of the regional differences in energy use townhouses are more energy efficient than singlefamily homes because less heat for example is wasted per person similarly areas with more homes in a compact neighborhood encourage walking biking and transit thereby reducing transportation energy use a  us epa study found that multifamily homes in urban

exploration in the united states according to president barack obama studies suggest that if there is enough political will it is feasible to supply the total united states with  renewable energy by  oiledit further information oil megaprojects  for most of the twentieth century and the early part of the twentyfirst century the majority of energy consumed has been from oil  fossil fuel provided  of the worlds energy in  with oil the largest contribution the united states became a world power in the early th century as they increased development of oil production and influenced world oil reserves for growth and development as the th century developed petroleum gained increasing importance by providing heating and power to the commercial and industrial sectors oil was also used in transportation first for railroads and later for motor vehicles as automobiles became more affordable demand for oil quickly rose since the rise of the automobile industry oil price demand and production have all increased from  to  fuel was directly correlated with gross national product gnp oil shocks have often coincided with recessions and the government has responded to oil shocks with a variety of methods in the s oil prices were peaking and many commentators believed that oil supplies were running out congress was confronted by requests to augment supplies so a generous depletion allowance was enacted for producers in  which increased investment returns substantially this change induced additional exploration activity and subsequently the discovery of large new oil reservoirs the next decade the situation was reversed with prices low and dropping this led to demands for more orderly competition and set minimum oil prices rather than repealing the previous policies enacted in the s congress enacted a pricesupport system similar cycles have occurred in the s and s priceedit with the exception of one every us recession since world war ii experienced a sharp increase in the price of oil this correlation strongly signifies the us dependency of oil for the economy as well as oils importance in us development for most of the time since the war many of the key cases of crude oil price increases in the postwar period were associated with political upheaval from oil rich countries domestic production and consumption were outpaced by us demand toward the end of the s and middle eastern nations gained a significant amount of political leverage in controlling prices based on their production price increases have been directly related to increased investment and subsequent production in oil following world war ii european reconstruction was the primary objective of the united states economy and investment eventually rose after a longterm price increase at the end of the war during the s there were strikes by oil workers production restrictions imposed by the texas railroad commission as well as the suez crisis and korean war—all creating steep price increases with prices only falling after production was able to meet demand peak oil in the united states resulted in a definite decline of us reserves and even more strikes by oil workers additional singular events such as the opec embargo the rupture of the transarabian pipeline and iranian nationalization of the oil industry led to further price increases that were never before seen each case was followed by a marked recession in the us economy in  oil prices rose briefly to as high as barrel and us gasoline prices jumped from  to gallon in  leading to a search for alternate sources and by  less than half of us oil consumption was imported however as of january  the price of oil has collapsed to around barrel crude oil prices to gas prices consumption and productionedit in the twentieth century oil production became of more value as the us industrialized and developed commercial transportation such as railroads and motor vehicles furthermore oil consumption also increased due to electricity after electricity oil became more important in commercial manufacturing and residential sectors such as heating and cooking therefore during this period the growth of oil consumption indicates that the united states was becoming dependent on oil and it aided the growth of the domestic oil industry however us oil domestic production could not cover the growing demand in the us market which led the us to look for a new supply internationally us consumption of oil increased  between  and  followed by another increase of  in  the first shock of the transportation era occurred in  and lasted for about a year the shortage of oil devastated the entire west coast with hourlong lines for gasoline and in many places fuel was not available for at least a week finally big production from texas california and oklahoma took the shortage of oil away causing oil prices to fall  between  and  the great depression in  was a time with growing supply and falling demand causing the price of oil to decrease about  from  to  toward the end of world war ii the automotive era settled rapidly and the us demand of oil increased  between  and  while motor vehicle registrations increased by  around  demand of oil exceeded supply of oil leading the us to start importing oil therefore the us quickly became a major importer of oil instead of being the major exporter in  due to a strike by us oil refinery workers the united states and the united kingdom cut  of fuel delivery to civilian flights while canada postponed all private flights until the s the price of oil was relatively stable and the world market could cover the excess demand of oil in the us however in  the price of oil increased due to the arab oil embargo against the us following united states support of israel in the yom kippur war during that time arab oil producers reduced production mbd for two months  of global output during this time people reduced their consumption of oil by turning down thermostats and carpooling to work which together with the lower demand due to the  recession resulted in a reduction in oil consumption after the crisis of  price of oil increased again between  and  due to the iranian revolution this crisis was related to political instability in a major oilexporting region during this period oil consumption decreased due to new efficiency cars at that time were developed so less oil was required and industrialization was also advanced to reduce the consumption of oil this led to a decline in us demand of oil and reduced the amount of international imports the last energy crises in the us occurred in  this occurred because iraq invaded kuwait similar to the previous crisis price of oil increased and oil consumption decreased but by a smaller amount and had a smaller effect in   of petroleum consumption in the us was for transportation approximately  of transportation consumption was gasoline today us is still dependent on oil as oil is an important player socially economically and politically us demand of oil is increasing exponentially causing the us to continue to rely on foreign countries policyedit regulation of the oil market has been a major player in oil history policies affect the market in a variety of ways such as price production consumption supply and demand the oil market has a history of booms and troughs which caused producers to demand government intervention many times this government involvement only made the situation worse and many of the regulations were quickly ruled illegal and removed before world war ii many of the problems within the oil market were related to changing prices during the s oil prices were beginning to peak leading to fears of oil depletion in response to these fears during coolidges term congress enacted a depletion allowance to producers which led to a surge of investment in the oil business and the discovery of many new large oil reservoirs the next decade consisted of falling prices due to the new investment and overproduction the declining prices led producers to demand some form of price support system one example of how prices were propped up was a prorationing order made by the texas railroad commission which restricted oil production and increased price this order was soon ruled illegal by federal district court in  the s was the beginning of large federal intervention in the oil industry and began with the creation of the national industrial recovery act in  this act allowed for natural price competition instead of agreements between the major producers however this act was ruled unconstitutional in  while the time before world war ii was filled with issues regarding price the post war era consisted of increasing oil imports partly due to the price support established during the s and s the artificially high domestic prices led to a surge of imports from lower priced foreign producers in  a clause was added to the reciprocal trade act amendments which gave the president the power to limit imports of a specific commodity if that particular commodity was harmful to the security of the nation this clause allowed eisenhower to enact oil import quotas in  which ultimately caused international oil prices to decline these import quotas restricted international oil companies from the us market and led them to form opec during the s richard nixon put in place many phrases of price controls after many new regulations that altered the original price control system president carter eventually began removing these controls in  during the carter administration in response to an energy crisis and hostile iranian and soviet union relations president jimmy carter announced the carter doctrine which declared that any interference with u s interests in the persian gulf would be considered an attack on us vital interests ronald reagan later expanded this doctrine since the s the oil market has been free of most regulations electrical
