basin  barrels per day capacity stateoftheart facility intends to leverage existing infrastructure bring economic benefits to fort stockton texas area austin texas march   globe newswire  mmex resources corp otcpk mmex a global energy company focusing on the acquisition development and financing of oil gas refining and infrastructure projects in texas and south america announced today that it plans to build a  million  barrels per day capacity crude oil refinery in the west texas permian basin subject to the receipt of required governmental permits and completion of required debt and equity financing located  miles northeast of fort stockton texas near the sulfur junction spur of the texas pacifico railroad the acre facility intends to utilize its connection to existing railways to export diesel gasoline and jet fuels liquefied petroleum gas and crude oil to western mexico and south america once completed the pecos county refinery will be one of the first oil refineries built in the united states in more than  years jack w hanks president  ceo of mmex resources corp commented “the permian basin is the largest continuous oil discovery in america and has experienced exponential gains in daily production volume recently the existing facilities and pipeline networks are largely unequipped to handle this growth and are limiting where products can be transported by building a stateoftheart refinery along the region’s existing railway infrastructure we hope to bring a local and export market for crude oil and refined products which will add substantial job and economic growth to west texas” mmex plans to surround the pecos county refinery with an additional  acres of buffer property and leverage stateoftheart emissions technologies to yield minimal environmental impact it also expects to feature closedin water and aircooling systems which will require very little local water resources construction is slated to begin in early  following the permitting process and the facility is projected to begin operations in  the company anticipates the month construction process will create approximately  jobs in the area during peak construction as well as foster a significant number of indirect jobs and revenue for companies in catering workforce housing construction equipment and other industries once operational the facility is expected to provide an estimated  permanent jobs and generate substantial tax revenue for pecos county the mmex management team has more than  years of experience building and managing multimillion dollar gas processing pipelines power plants refinery and oil and gas operations in peru and the united states mmex purchased the rights to the project from maple resources corporation as with each of its previous projects the management team will establish local offices and representatives to keep the surrounding communities informed throughout the construction phase and once the refinery is fully operational “mmex resources is eager to work alongside the pecos county community to produce a stateoftheart facility that opens up economic and job opportunities for the region the safety of our employees the neighboring community and the environment are our top priorities” concluded hanks about mmex resources corp mmex resources corporation mmex is a development stage company formed to

flexibility mmex has incurred continuous losses since inception and has a large accumulated deficit in its book in fact the company has a history of illiquidity and cash crunch therefore its ability to arrange required funding for the captioned project in a time bound manner is a significant contingency mmex is burning through cash  do not have enough liquidity to run its existing activities its ability to continue as “an ongoing concern” is entirely dependent on its ability to raise additional capital therefore any sort of inability to raise fund in a timely and prudent manner could materially  adversely affect its operations also additional capital is likely to lead to dilution in its present equity capital the legal framework expected approvals permits and clearances surrounding the upcoming project is uncertain at the moment future regulatory developments in these areas and its impact on mmex business will remain a critical business sensitivity factor for the company earnings review mmex have not yet begun to generate revenues as per its latest available filing as of july   it had current assets of  comprised of cash and current liabilities of  resulting in a working capital deficit of  because of continuing operating losses mmex have not generated positive operating cash flows as a result they have significant shortterm cash needs as of yet its

liquefied petroleum gas and other products that will be shipped by rail to meet growing demand in mexico mmex resources corp ceo jack hanks said the pecos county refinery will take full advantage of large oil discoveries in the permian basin which has become the hottest shale play in the united states the existing facilities and pipeline networks are largely unequipped to handle this growth and are limiting where products can be transported hanks said in a statement by building a stateoftheart refinery along the region’s existing railway infrastructure we hope to bring a local and export market for crude oil and refined products which will add substantial job and economic growth to west texas” mmex resources has a contract on a acre property next to the sulfur junction spur of the texas pacifico railroad about  miles northeast of fort stockton the rail line starts in san angelo to the border town of presidio and then into ojinaga chihuahua the austinbased company plans to complete an environmental assessment for the property before submitting a permit application to the texas commission on environmental quality and other agencies but hanks reported there are already plans in the works to use a closedloop air cooling system and a closedloop water system to minimize the impact in the desert ecosystem if approved by regulators the month construction process will create around  jobs while the completed refinery is expected to employ around  people “mmex resources is eager to work alongside the pecos county community to produce a stateoftheart facility that opens up economic and job opportunities for the region hanks said the safety of our employees the neighboring community and the environment are our top priorities although there has not been a new refinery built in the united states in more than  years the mmex resources project is the second one proposed to be built in texas over the past six months in november the woodlandsbased raven

growth to west texas”   mmex plans to surround the pecos county refinery with an additional  acres of buffer property and leverage stateoftheart emissions technologies to yield minimal environmental impact it also expects to feature closedin water and aircooling systems which will require very little local water resources construction is slated to begin in early  following the permitting process and the facility is projected to begin operations in    the company anticipates the month construction process will create approximately  jobs in the area during peak construction as well as foster a significant number of indirect jobs and revenue for companies in catering workforce housing construction equipment and other industries once operational the facility is expected to provide an estimated  permanent jobs and generate substantial tax revenue for pecos county   the mmex management team has more than  years of experience building and managing multimillion dollar gas processing pipelines power plants refinery and oil and gas operations in peru and the united states mmex purchased the rights to the project from maple resources corporation as with each of its previous projects the management team will establish local offices and representatives to keep the surrounding communities informed throughout the construction phase and once the refinery is fully operational   “mmex resources is eager to work alongside the pecos county community to produce a stateoftheart facility that opens up economic and job opportunities for the region the safety of our employees the neighboring community and the environment are our top priorities” concluded hanks             about mmex resources corp mmex resources corporation mmex is a development stage company formed to engage
