near death and gradual rebirth located on jefferson countys quimper peninsula at the northeast corner of of the olympic peninsula near where the strait of juan de fuca meets admiralty inlet the future town site was home to a band of the klallam tribe and smaller groups from other tribes the first nonindian settlers arrived in  and port townsend because of its position near the entrance to the sound soon became puget sounds customs port of entry and a bustling port seemingly destined for greatness but its progress was repeatedly thwarted primarily by the absence of a railroad connection to the major markets then developing on puget sound to the south it survived years of population loss and economic stagnation before the economy was stabilized by the opening of a paper mill in  the city grew slowly over the following decades and gradually blossomed as a tourist destination noted for its natural setting maritime charm and many wellpreserved homes and buildings from the late victorian age the port townsend historic landmark district was established in  one of three surviving victorianera seaports in the nation kah tai when port townsend originally townshend bay was named in  by british captain george vancouver  the area around todays port townsend was occupied primarily by members of the klallam or sklallam tribe who called the spot kah tai they wintered in large communal cedar poleandplank homes along the shoreline moving off in smaller family groups during warmer months to fish hunt forage and trade shoredwelling indians in the northwest were early victims of diseases brought by seaborne spanish and british explorers starting in the late eighteenth century they fell prey to smallpox measles diphtheria and other pathogens that can no longer be identified with certainty these plagues came in waves and went on for many decades records of the british hudsons bay company estimated that as late as  there were  surviving klallams less than  years later the company counted only about  however numbers vary widely depending on who was doing the counting and where an  census conducted by geologist and ethnographer george gibbs  counted with impressive precision  surviving klallams more than double the hudsons bay total shortly after washington territory was created in  the first territorial governor isaac ingalls stevens  set about clearing much of the land of its indigenous inhabitants the klallam and the chimakum and skokomish tribes gave up most of their homelands in the january  treaty of point no point they had little bargaining power and the negotiations if such they may be called were conducted in chinook jargon a trading tongue of limited vocabulary under considerable pressure the tribes ceded their rights to nearly  acres of land receiving in return a mere acre skokomish reservation on hood canal the right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations and  payable over  years treaty of point no point the klallams living on the shore of port townsend bay were loathe to move to the skokomish reservation and most remained in place under two successive chiefs shaiak d  and his younger brother chetzemoka  they lived on good terms with the early settlers chetzemoka called the duke of york by whites who had trouble pronouncing indian names visited san francisco in the summer of  why and with whom does not appear in the record there he met james g swan  a chronicler ethnographer lawyer and allaround polymath who later would become an important figure in port townsends history chetzemoka saw white settlement as inevitable and maintained friendly relations with the newcomers though that ultimately did little good  nearly all the indians in port townsend were ousted in  their beach dwellings burned and their canoes towed to the skokomish reservation chetzemoka soon brought most of his band back to port townsend bay settling on indian island across from the town site many klallams integrated with the areas nonindian communities while others gathered into four distinct groups the jamestown sklallam the port gamble sklallam the lower elwha klallam and the scianew first nations on vancouver island the first settlers william r blanket bill jarman  arrived at port townsend bay by canoe in  and lived for some time with the family of chief shaiak later called king george by settlers he was the first outsider known to have done more than pass briefly through the area on the way to somewhere else but he claimed no land and did not put down permanent roots in the early s the trading brig george emery under captain lafayette balch  sailed frequently back and forth between san francisco and puget sound carrying mostly timber and often stopping at port townsend bay in august  henry c wilson  a clerk on the ship disembarked there and filed a donation claim on the western shore although he did not immediately take up residence he would later return and wilsons was the first recorded legal claim on klallam land at port townsend two bachelors alfred a plummer  and charles bachelder passed port townsend as passengers on the george emery while heading for port steilacoom a trading depot farther south on puget sound balch encouraged the two to settle on the olympic peninsula and after working at port steilacoom for a time they obtained an indian canoe paddled north and came ashore on april   near point hudson they filed donation claims on land about a mile from wilsons and built a tworoom  byfoot cabin at what is now the corner of water and tyler streets becoming port townsends first permanent nonnative settlers plummer and bachelder were soon joined by loren b hastings  and francis w pettygrove  two family men looking for a new place to settle pettygrove had come to oregon territory by sea in  and cofounded the city of portland in  he and hastings traveled together to the california gold rush and did well selling supplies to gold seekers they decided to move with their families to puget sound and in october  the men traveled down the columbia river up the cowlitz then overland to olympia and finally by canoe to point hudson there they were met by plummer and bachelder and the four agreed to form a partnership and create a town hastings and pettygrove staked claims on the bay between those of plummer and bachelder to the north and that of wilson to the south they returned to portland where hastings purchased a foot schooner the mary taylor in february  some sources say february  some the st and others the rd the hastings pettygroves and one other family left the ship in port townsend bay and took up their new lives the klallams were friendly and helpful to these first settlers but chief shaiak wanted compensation for the land they were claiming as homesteads he was given some trade goods and told that the us government would eventually pay for the land a promise the newcomers may well have believed to be true then there was a rift among the settlers charles bachelder had a liking for strong drink something all had agreed to avoid and his interests were bought out the three remaining partners soldiered on building a warehouse and starting a fish business the towns first commercial enterprise and a trading post a curious choice as the city developed it took on a roughly triangular shape with the apex at the tip of point hudson pointing east broadening as it grew inland to the west many of the early arrivals took homesteads in happy valley so named by loren hastings a threemile swath of fertile but swampy land that lay in the north half of the triangle between the open strait of juan de fuca on the north and the northwest shore of port townsend bay near point hudson on the south the place the settlers chose for a commercial center was south of that and far from ideal there much of the shore was separated from the uplands by a high bluff just one of several topographical challenges as later described by architectural historian carolyn pitts the new residents built log cabins at scattered locations in the surrounding area the topography and dense forestation of the site presented many difficulties that influenced early patterns of development the lagoon at point hudson was essentially a depression produced by shifting sand and the remaining beach was susceptible to flooding because of its elevation what little land that remained in front of the bluff was cut off at high water from the beach farther down the bay which although the bluff tapered off was useless as it was a continually flooded marshland on top of the bluff the plateau was impenetrable a dense undergrowth everywhere except along the edge nrhp nomination form  at the end of  port townsends nonindian population was just the three families and  single white men living on a problematic site but the dearth of other settlements on the olympic peninsula and port townsends position at the gateway to puget sound would soon give it prominence beyond its size the power of place jefferson county was established as part of oregon territory on december   and port townsend was named county seat although it may not legally have been a town at all some sources date the first plat to  and that is certainly when hastings and pettygrove made their claims however the first formal plat map appears to be one that was recorded with the jefferson county auditor on august   it showed  lots most of which were on top of the bluff the proposed route of aptly named water street which would become the towns main downtown thoroughfare was partially submerged much of the time and the only buildable lots along the waterfront lay between it and the bluff a distance of about one city block washington territory was created on march   and in  the headquarters of the puget sound customs collection district was moved to port townsend from olympia a federal district court was established that same year and in  dr samuel m mccurdy  opened the privately owned marine hospital to provide medical services to seamen and quarantine for those carrying contagious diseases in  the us military established fort townsend about four miles down the bay near chimacum creek which was the nearest reliable source of good water the fort was built to protect the towns citizens from indian attack but many believed it was too far away to be of much use much of the towns early economy was based on barter as there was little cash around and little to buy with what there was but every ship arriving from foreign ports had to stop at port townsend to clear customs and many domestic vessels also stopped before sailing down puget sound to seattle and other growing communities to the south in  d c h rothschild  opened the kentucky store the towns first general mercantile establishment that same year charles eisenbeis  who would later become the citys first mayor opened a cracker factory primarily to supply hardtack to visiting ships the first deepwater wharf was built in  by captain ernest fowler who would also in  erect the citys first stone building by  port townsends population was  enough to make it the seventhmostpopulous place in the territory optimists particularly those with sizeable stakes in its prosperity began calling port townsend such things as the key city of puget sound and the new york of the west expressions of hope far more than reality not everyone shared these rosy views and contemporary opinions about port townsend and its future ran the gamut from bullish hyperbole to scathing contempt in  j ross browne  an inspector for the us treasury department reported the streets of port townsend are paved with sand and the public squares are curiously ornamented with dead horses and the bones of many dead cows this of course gives a very original appearance to the public pleasure grounds and enables strangers to know when they arrive in the city by reason of the peculiar odor so that even admitting the absence of lamps no person can fail to recognize port townsend in the darkest night morgan j ross browne  the residents of port townsend begged to differ quite vociferously and browne later issued an apology of sorts a petition was made to the territorial legislature in december  to incorporate port townsend and grant a charter for selfrule among those signing were hastings plummer pettygrove and henry c wilson who had returned to take up his  claim the legislature granted the request on january   making port townsend the fourth incorporated city in the territory after steilacoom olympia and vancouver under the charter a fivemember board of trustees later reduced to three was elected and it appointed a clerk and a marshal in  the legislature changed port townsends governance to the mayorcouncil form and it later changed again to a city manager and council with incorporation port townsend had the power to handle its own affairs some of which soon became rather complicated victor smith  appointed federal customs collector in  had views similar to brownes and professed himself unhappy that a place like port townsend was an official port of entry to the united states and its territories after describing the city as a collection of huts he recommended that its federal functions be moved west down the strait of juan de fuca to port angeles a place far less developed than port townsend but where smith happened to be speculating in land morgan victor smith  his dogged efforts were successful and on june   congress authorized moving the customs district headquarters port townsend residents resisted claiming among other things that smith had embezzled from the customs accounts but smith was determined he threatened to shell port townsend from the lighthouse tender uss shubrick if the customshouse files were not turned over they were and he decamped with them to port angeles smith drowned in  and port townsend was able in  to reclaim its status as headquarters of the customs district of puget sound ensuring its survival if not its future prosperity getting by but not big the bloody civil war and its aftermath preoccupied the nation during much of the s and although it was remote from the battlefields the march of progress in washington territory slowed the federal census of  counted  nonnative residents in port townsend a little more than twice the  count and enough to make it then the fourthlargest city in the territory after walla walla olympia and seattle in that order but with barely half the population of the latter the nations economy slowly returned to normal after the war rumors of railroads fueled a building boom in port townsend that began in the early s but for the time being the city got by with a mix of agriculture logging and catering to the maritime trade chandleries carried ship supplies of every description and hotels saloons and bordellos were built to house and entertain the steady stream of seamen passing through it was estimated that half the ships entering puget sound picked up crew in port townsend and crimping or shanghaiing was not uncommon and would continue for many years but technology was advancing and as steampowered vessels increasingly replaced sail in the s and s the fluky inland winds of puget sound became largely irrelevant to navigation if steamships didnt have to stop at port townsend for customs inspection they often didnt stop at all hopes for a shipbuilding industry did not pan out due mostly to the early exhaustion of the supply of suitably tall trees from nearby forests no doubt for the same reason the areas first large sawmills went in not at port townsend but at port ludlow  miles to the south and at port gamble on the kitsap peninsula to the east nor did the arable land near the city produce enough to support an agricultural export trade of any appreciable size although port townsends wharves also handled produce from other area communities the mix of activities supported steady if very slow growth and by  there were  port townsend businesses listed in a regional directory the first brick home owned by hiram parrish  was built in  with bricks made in happy valley by s m eskildsen  by  the population had increased to  but faster growth elsewhere made the city again only the seventhlargest in the territory port townsend was surviving even growing somewhat but it was losing ground to other territorial population centers the railroad problem one person who did not share brownes and smiths dyspeptic views of port townsend was james g swan originally from massachusetts he had spent three years on shoalwater later willapa bay on the washington coast and then served as secretary to isaac stevens when stevens was a territorial delegate in washington dc swan moved to port townsend in  and described the community he found during the last eight years the growth of the town has been gradual but permanent and it now numbers  inhabitants there are between fifty and sixty buildings in the place   there are two good wharves  and the facilities for business accommodation are equal to any i have yet seen in the territory   if mr brownes report was correct there certainly has been a wonderful change for the better the beachcombers and outlaws as mr brown designated the inhabitants  with very few exceptions  have left the place almost out of the world  the citizens of port townsend placed much of their hope for the future on the coming of the railroad and like those in many other pioneer towns they would suffer bitter disappointment perhaps no one suffered more than swan who for nearly  years struggled to link his city by rail to the wider world he was seemingly well placed to do so he served from  to  as an agent of the northern pacific railroad hired to study and recommend sites for a western terminus that would extend the companys line northward from portland into the rapidly growing puget sound region swan of course recommended port townsend but in  the railroad ignored his advice and chose tacoma despite this disappointment between  and  port townsends population grew by nearly  percent to  while this looks impressive enough in isolation during the same decade seattles population increased by more than  percent tacomas by nearly  percent and spokanes by nearly  percent people were pouring into the northwest but the vast majority of them were settling somewhere other than port townsend nevertheless dreams of a rail link persisted and some of the towns leading citizens eventually decided to take matters into their own hands on september   the port townsend  southern railroad was incorporated and announced plans to run tracks south to hood canal then on to olympia the hope couched more as a promise to prospective investors was that one of the major railroads would see this as an opportunity take over the completed line tie it in with the transcontinental system and empower port townsend to compete with the downsound cities that were fast outstripping it in every quantifiable category rights of way were purchased in  and construction began in early  but the money ran out after a mere mile of track was laid later in  the year washington gained statehood the union pacific offered to make port townsend the northern terminus of its transcontinental line if it could acquire the port townsend  southerns franchise and rights of way and if the city kicked in  the citizenry was swept again by railroad dreams and the towns newspaper the leader predicted this day means a great deal more to us than we are aware of at present   port townsend will now get its share of the wealth and commerce of europe that annually finds its way hither and has heretofore passed us by city of dreams  some outsiders were more cleareyed but no one was listening in an  report prepared for the seattle lake shore  eastern railway which also was looking to expand attorney w h ruffner summed up the fundamental geographical nature of the problem the location of port townsend puts that town out of the general competition   a report on washington territory there simply was no compelling economic rationale for a rail link to the stillremote tip of the quimper peninsula but dreams die hard the union pacifics conditions were met and on october   a groundbreaking ceremony two miles west of town drew practically the entire population to hear speeches proclaiming impending glory work was to begin simultaneously at portland and port townsend and everyone looked forward to the day the two would join ending port townsends isolation and realizing its longheld ambitions property values soared and in  alone realestate transactions in port townsend totaled nearly  million and this in a city with barely  residents before that year was out the city boasted six banks six drygoods stores six hardware stores  hotels  real estate offices and three streetcar lines flush with optimism port townsend started to build an impressive new city hall on the corner of water and madison streets fittingly as it would turn out the contract to start railroad construction south from port townsend was let on april fools day  by june  men were at work a depot roundhouse and railyard were being built on landfill at kah tai lagoon at the south end of the city and by september there were trains running daily to leland lake about twenty miles away while the rails were heading south out of town two grand symbols of optimism were rising in the city on the bluff above downtown construction began in  on the romanesque jefferson county courthouse complete with a foot clock tower it opened late the next year beneath the bluff at the corner of madison and water streets the new city hall also opened in  both buildings were added to the national register of historic places in the early s and both were renovated in the first decade of the twentyfirst century despite all the apparent progress things were starting to go badly wrong in the south union pacifics subsidiary the oregon improvement company had been devoting its energies to unsuccessful land speculation rather than laying track and it went into bankruptcy receivership in  in the north the railroad was completed as far as quilcene where according to railroad historian steve hauff somebody noticed that mount walker was there they found there was really no way to get around this and that was the end of it railroads gone   and the end it was at least of any realistic hope that port townsend would become a leading city in the young state on the heels of the local railroad debacle came the national financial meltdown known as the panic of  which was triggered with particular irony for port townsend by railroad overbuilding and debt commerce in the city slowed to a near stop and the bay became a watery warehouse for a fleet of unused vessels left to slowly rot at anchor property values plummeted like the railroads the city had drastically overbuilt downtown buildings stood vacant streetcar lines were torn up and all but the most avid and unrealistic city boosters fell silent the city had a brief bright moment in march  when the federal government completed the port townsend post office court and customs house on the bluff above downtown construction had begun in  and the steel and brick sandstoneclad building was finished several years late and several times over budget it was an impressive edifice but almost contemporaneous with its dedication people started abandoning the city in droves between  and  nearly onefourth fled leaving behind a population of less than  port townsend would never again be counted as one of the  most populous cities in the state and it fell into a deep and prolonged decline there would be brief outbursts of train hysteria in later years unrealistic dreams sustained by little more than rumor and vestigial boosterism the little line to quilcene ran on until the s almost always at a loss and was said to have changed ownership more than any other railroad in the entire country a triangle of fire few could have been more disappointed than james swan but he was an optimist by nature and before he died in  he was able to perform one last service for the city he loved the federal government had seen little need for heavy fortifications on northwest waterways but in  the puget sound naval station was established at bremerton and it required protection fort townsend was too far from admiralty inlet to do much good and had been heavily damaged in a fire it was closed in  kicking another small crutch out from under the struggling city but the following year congress passed a huge allotment for military fortifications and swan who was widely respected and had many contacts in washington dc lobbied hard to bring some of that money to port townsend while the extent of his influence cannot be accurately judged the federal government decided to built three forts that together could cover admiralty inlet with triangulated artillery fire  fort casey on whidbey islands admiralty head across from port townsend fort flagler on the north end of marrowstone island and fort worden on the northern outskirts of port townsend at point wilson all were substantially completed by  and fort worden was designated coastal defense headquarters these facilities did not lead to great prosperity for the city but their construction and presence did provide a lifeline when it was most needed over the ensuing years the forts economic contributions varied with their state of activation in threatening times and during war troop levels increased and the local economy benefited in peaceful times or times of government belttightening the forts were more lightly manned and nearby communities suffered they were no replacement for the boost a rail link would have brought but they helped keep port townsend alive when it had few other prospects the mill and the military the forts modest boost helped the citys population to increase between  and  albeit by barely  souls but the military presence may have been a mixed blessing a comprehensive study of the citys educational system in  noted the fever of old boom days has not been completely lost from the blood the will to work at the immediate task is not fully present and the presence of the military with its easy money tends to keep alive the feeling of a glorious past that will surely come again lull  this may have been a subjective and overly harsh conclusion but the report did highlight a very real threat to the citys future the most universal remark which one hears from the young people and from the old too is this why should a young man remain in port townsend there is nothing for him to do here  port townsend is now playing a losing game it is educating its young people for a life that they will lead elsewhere lull  the bleakness of the situation should not be overstated however the sun still shone on port townsend and the beauty of its natural setting made up for much many residents were solidly middleclass by the measure of the day and a fortunate few got rich like any city port townsend had its share of murders scandals mysterious disappearances divorces and other events to keep the citizenry entertained but for most of the first  years of the twentieth century and particularly after the customs headquarters moved to seattle in  it lay largely outside the flow of historical events a small quiet city on a quiet peninsula it enjoyed a brief moderate boom during world war i but by  the population had fallen back to  the lowest since the mids in  county voters approved the formation of a public port district but a persistent lack of financing ensured that it would accomplish very little until the s some in port townsend may still have dreamt of greatness but the decades of false hope had taken their toll finally in  a single large stable employer came to town the zellerbach corporation of san francisco through its subsidiary national paper products company announced in july of that year that it would build a kraftpaper plant at glen cove about three miles down the bay from point hudson the plant would require vast amounts of fresh water and port townsend promptly applied for and received water rights to the big quilcene and little quilcene rivers in addition to providing immediate construction jobs and longterm employment opportunities the company absorbed much of the cost of rebuilding the citys aged watersupply system more than  workers were hired to build the plant the new water system was activated on october   and the mill started production the next day in  the crown zellerbach port townsend mill as it was then called had  employees and an annual payroll of  of equal importance the gravitational pull of such a large enterprise drew a wide range of supporting businesses to the city by  the population had rebounded to  up nearly  percent over  and the largest census count since the boom times of  to the great satisfaction of those with long memories port townsend remained relatively prosperous throughout the dark years of the great depression and for the first time in many decades was the object of some envy in  the citys population reached a new high of  and it increased further with the arrival of approximately  military personnel after americas entry into world war ii in december  the war brought prosperity the crown zellerbach mill ran  hours a day and soldiers from the three nearby forts spent their leave and their money in town by  the population had grown to  but the stimulus provided by the military tapered off with demobilization and ended with the closure of the forts fort flagler and fort worden closed permanently in  and fort casey in  all became state parks and continued to benefit the region as tourist attractions fort worden gave the city an additional if temporary economic boost in  when it was used as a location for the hit movie an officer and a gentleman due to the fort closures by  the citys population had fallen by more than onequarter to  and many in port townsend must have felt the boomandbust history was being dismally repeated but there was one big difference this time  the paper mill stayed it remained the countys largest employer and still supported a bevy of related businesses once again the city clawed its way back and after the setback of  the population grew in every census reaching  in  a city in amber the building boom of the s and early s left port townsends downtown streets lined with impressive buildings characteristic of the period and a number of its notable mansions remained wellpreserved the predominant styles were variations of latevictorian architecture many of the downtown buildings sat empty for years but relatively few were destroyed either for lack of funds or lack of other uses for the property they sat on left largely untouched they eventually proved to be of considerable benefit in  seattle architect and preservationist victor steinbrueck  gave a lecture in port townsend sponsored by the citys art league and chamber of commerce he told the assembled port townsend is a museum and you are the caretakers city of dreams  his words were taken to heart and the city first drew on its architectural legacy in january  with a showing of just one of its historic homes the saunders house at the south end of town the organizers of this first homes tour expected two or three hundred visitors at most nearly  showed up causing a huge traffic jam it was clear they were on to something the homes tour became an annual event of increasing popularity and the people of port townsend quickly came to realize that their city however inadvertently had preserved the only largely intact victorian seaport on the west coast beginning in the early s the city the port of port townsend and others worked to gain official recognition for the historic waterfront and the nineteenthcentury residential area located on the bluff above downtown both were placed on the national register of historic places in  and a year later the area encompassing them was designated a national historic landmark district as was the former military base at fort worden it was also in  that the city hosted north americas firstever wooden boat festival at the point hudson marina owned and operated by the port district and this led to the  creation of the wooden boat foundation which sponsored the event in later years always drawing crowds in the thousands in  the foundation opened its northwest marine center sponsor of everything from boatrepair classes to regattas and home to the wooden boat chandlery a onestop shop for boat lovers by  in addition to the historic landmark district port townsend had at least  individual buildings listed on the national register of historic places the largest employer remained the crown zellerbach mill but a thriving boatbuilding industry  everything from small wooden sailing craft to large megayachts  had developed along with numerous facilities large and small for ship repair as the citys charms became more widely known it drew increasing numbers of retired people and emptynesters and many brought with them the desire and the means to help port townsend preserve its heritage in  the city was awarded the great american main street award a national prize recognizing preservationbased economicrevitalization efforts several of the citys historic houses were converted to bedandbreakfasts and in its wellpreserved downtown district visitors shopped for everything from antiques to zucchini in  a major restoration of the nineteenthcentury city hall home since  to the jefferson county historical society was completed the first  years of port townsends history were a roller coaster of high hopes big gambles bad breaks and deep disappointments with the coming of the zellerbach mill in  the city settled into a long period of relative economic stability but with greatly lowered expectations while dreams of becoming the new york of the west did not come close to realization most who live in port townsend today surrounded by the areas natural beauty and the wellpreserved architecture of the past would probably say that

disappointments near death and gradual rebirth located on jefferson countys quimper peninsula at the northeast corner of of the olympic peninsula near where the strait of juan de fuca meets admiralty inlet the future town site was home to a band of the klallam tribe and smaller groups from other tribes the first nonindian settlers arrived in  and port townsend because of its position near the entrance to the sound soon became puget sounds customs port of entry and a bustling port seemingly destined for greatness but its progress was repeatedly thwarted primarily by the absence of a railroad connection to the major markets then developing on puget sound to the south it survived years of population loss and economic stagnation before the economy was stabilized by the opening of a paper mill in  the city grew slowly over the following decades and gradually blossomed as a tourist destination noted for its natural setting maritime charm and many wellpreserved homes and buildings from the late victorian age the port townsend historic landmark district was established in  one of three surviving victorianera seaports in the nation kah tai when port townsend originally townshend bay was named in  by british captain george vancouver  the area around todays port townsend was occupied primarily by members of the klallam or sklallam tribe who called the spot kah tai they wintered in large communal cedar poleandplank homes along the shoreline moving off in smaller family groups during warmer months to fish hunt forage and trade shoredwelling indians in the northwest were early victims of diseases brought by seaborne spanish and british explorers starting in the late eighteenth century they fell prey to smallpox measles diphtheria and other pathogens that can no longer be identified with certainty these plagues came in waves and went on for many decades records of the british hudsons bay company estimated that as late as  there were  surviving klallams less than  years later the company counted only about  however numbers vary widely depending on who was doing the counting and where an  census conducted by geologist and ethnographer george gibbs  counted with impressive precision  surviving klallams more than double the hudsons bay total shortly after washington territory was created in  the first territorial governor isaac ingalls stevens  set about clearing much of the land of its indigenous inhabitants the klallam and the chimakum and skokomish tribes gave up most of their homelands in the january  treaty of point no point they had little bargaining power and the negotiations if such they may be called were conducted in chinook jargon a trading tongue of limited vocabulary under considerable pressure the tribes ceded their rights to nearly  acres of land receiving in return a mere acre skokomish reservation on hood canal the right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations and  payable over  years treaty of point no point the klallams living on the shore of port townsend bay were loathe to move to the skokomish reservation and most remained in place under two successive chiefs shaiak d  and his younger brother chetzemoka  they lived on good terms with the early settlers chetzemoka called the duke of york by whites who had trouble pronouncing indian names visited san francisco in the summer of  why and with whom does not appear in the record there he met james g swan  a chronicler ethnographer lawyer and allaround polymath who later would become an important figure in port townsends history chetzemoka saw white settlement as inevitable and maintained friendly relations with the newcomers though that ultimately did little good  nearly all the indians in port townsend were ousted in  their beach dwellings burned and their canoes towed to the skokomish reservation chetzemoka soon brought most of his band back to port townsend bay settling on indian island across from the town site many klallams integrated with the areas nonindian communities while others gathered into four distinct groups the jamestown sklallam the port gamble sklallam the lower elwha klallam and the scianew first nations on vancouver island the first settlers william r blanket bill jarman  arrived at port townsend bay by canoe in  and lived for some time with the family of chief shaiak later called king george by settlers he was the first outsider known to have done more than pass briefly through the area on the way to somewhere else but he claimed no land and did not put down permanent roots in the early s the trading brig george emery under captain lafayette balch  sailed frequently back and forth between san francisco and puget sound carrying mostly timber and often stopping at port townsend bay in august  henry c wilson  a clerk on the ship disembarked there and filed a donation claim on the western shore although he did not immediately take up residence he would later return and wilsons was the first recorded legal claim on klallam land at port townsend two bachelors alfred a plummer  and charles bachelder passed port townsend as passengers on the george emery while heading for port steilacoom a trading depot farther south on puget sound balch encouraged the two to settle on the olympic peninsula and after working at port steilacoom for a time they obtained an indian canoe paddled north and came ashore on april   near point hudson they filed donation claims on land about a mile from wilsons and built a tworoom  byfoot cabin at what is now the corner of water and tyler streets becoming port townsends first permanent nonnative settlers plummer and bachelder were soon joined by loren b hastings  and francis w pettygrove  two family men looking for a new place to settle pettygrove had come to oregon territory by sea in  and cofounded the city of portland in  he and hastings traveled together to the california gold rush and did well selling supplies to gold seekers they decided to move with their families to puget sound and in october  the men traveled down the columbia river up the cowlitz then overland to olympia and finally by canoe to point hudson there they were met by plummer and bachelder and the four agreed to form a partnership and create a town hastings and pettygrove staked claims on the bay between those of plummer and bachelder to the north and that of wilson to the south they returned to portland where hastings purchased a foot schooner the mary taylor in february  some sources say february  some the st and others the rd the hastings pettygroves and one other family left the ship in port townsend bay and took up their new lives the klallams were friendly and helpful to these first settlers but chief shaiak wanted compensation for the land they were claiming as homesteads he was given some trade goods and told that the us government would eventually pay for the land a promise the newcomers may well have believed to be true then there was a rift among the settlers charles bachelder had a liking for strong drink something all had agreed to avoid and his interests were bought out the three remaining partners soldiered on building a warehouse and starting a fish business the towns first commercial enterprise and a trading post a curious choice as the city developed it took on a roughly triangular shape with the apex at the tip of point hudson pointing east broadening as it grew inland to the west many of the early arrivals took homesteads in happy valley so named by loren hastings a threemile swath of fertile but swampy land that lay in the north half of the triangle between the open strait of juan de fuca on the north and the northwest shore of port townsend bay near point hudson on the south the place the settlers chose for a commercial center was south of that and far from ideal there much of the shore was separated from the uplands by a high bluff just one of several topographical challenges as later described by architectural historian carolyn pitts the new residents built log cabins at scattered locations in the surrounding area the topography and dense forestation of the site presented many difficulties that influenced early patterns of development the lagoon at point hudson was essentially a depression produced by shifting sand and the remaining beach was susceptible to flooding because of its elevation what little land that remained in front of the bluff was cut off at high water from the beach farther down the bay which although the bluff tapered off was useless as it was a continually flooded marshland on top of the bluff the plateau was impenetrable a dense undergrowth everywhere except along the edge nrhp nomination form  at the end of  port townsends nonindian population was just the three families and  single white men living on a problematic site but the dearth of other settlements on the olympic peninsula and port townsends position at the gateway to puget sound would soon give it prominence beyond its size the power of place jefferson county was established as part of oregon territory on december   and port townsend was named county seat although it may not legally have been a town at all some sources date the first plat to  and that is certainly when hastings and pettygrove made their claims however the first formal plat map appears to be one that was recorded with the jefferson county auditor on august   it showed  lots most of which were on top of the bluff the proposed route of aptly named water street which would become the towns main downtown thoroughfare was partially submerged much of the time and the only buildable lots along the waterfront lay between it and the bluff a distance of about one city block washington territory was created on march   and in  the headquarters of the puget sound customs collection district was moved to port townsend from olympia a federal district court was established that same year and in  dr samuel m mccurdy  opened the privately owned marine hospital to provide medical services to seamen and quarantine for those carrying contagious diseases in  the us military established fort townsend about four miles down the bay near chimacum creek which was the nearest reliable source of good water the fort was built to protect the towns citizens from indian attack but many believed it was too far away to be of much use much of the towns early economy was based on barter as there was little cash around and little to buy with what there was but every ship arriving from foreign ports had to stop at port townsend to clear customs and many domestic vessels also stopped before sailing down puget sound to seattle and other growing communities to the south in  d c h rothschild  opened the kentucky store the towns first general mercantile establishment that same year charles eisenbeis  who would later become the citys first mayor opened a cracker factory primarily to supply hardtack to visiting ships the first deepwater wharf was built in  by captain ernest fowler who would also in  erect the citys first stone building by  port townsends population was  enough to make it the seventhmostpopulous place in the territory optimists particularly those with sizeable stakes in its prosperity began calling port townsend such things as the key city of puget sound and the new york of the west expressions of hope far more than reality not everyone shared these rosy views and contemporary opinions about port townsend and its future ran the gamut from bullish hyperbole to scathing contempt in  j ross browne  an inspector for the us treasury department reported the streets of port townsend are paved with sand and the public squares are curiously ornamented with dead horses and the bones of many dead cows this of course gives a very original appearance to the public pleasure grounds and enables strangers to know when they arrive in the city by reason of the peculiar odor so that even admitting the absence of lamps no person can fail to recognize port townsend in the darkest night morgan j ross browne  the residents of port townsend begged to differ quite vociferously and browne later issued an apology of sorts a petition was made to the territorial legislature in december  to incorporate port townsend and grant a charter for selfrule among those signing were hastings plummer pettygrove and henry c wilson who had returned to take up his  claim the legislature granted the request on january   making port townsend the fourth incorporated city in the territory after steilacoom olympia and vancouver under the charter a fivemember board of trustees later reduced to three was elected and it appointed a clerk and a marshal in  the legislature changed port townsends governance to the mayorcouncil form and it later changed again to a city manager and council with incorporation port townsend had the power to handle its own affairs some of which soon became rather complicated victor smith  appointed federal customs collector in  had views similar to brownes and professed himself unhappy that a place like port townsend was an official port of entry to the united states and its territories after describing the city as a collection of huts he recommended that its federal functions be moved west down the strait of juan de fuca to port angeles a place far less developed than port townsend but where smith happened to be speculating in land morgan victor smith  his dogged efforts were successful and on june   congress authorized moving the customs district headquarters port townsend residents resisted claiming among other things that smith had embezzled from the customs accounts but smith was determined he threatened to shell port townsend from the lighthouse tender uss shubrick if the customshouse files were not turned over they were and he decamped with them to port angeles smith drowned in  and port townsend was able in  to reclaim its status as headquarters of the customs district of puget sound ensuring its survival if not its future prosperity getting by but not big the bloody civil war and its aftermath preoccupied the nation during much of the s and although it was remote from the battlefields the march of progress in washington territory slowed the federal census of  counted  nonnative residents in port townsend a little more than twice the  count and enough to make it then the fourthlargest city in the territory after walla walla olympia and seattle in that order but with barely half the population of the latter the nations economy slowly returned to normal after the war rumors of railroads fueled a building boom in port townsend that began in the early s but for the time being the city got by with a mix of agriculture logging and catering to the maritime trade chandleries carried ship supplies of every description and hotels saloons and bordellos were built to house and entertain the steady stream of seamen passing through it was estimated that half the ships entering puget sound picked up crew in port townsend and crimping or shanghaiing was not uncommon and would continue for many years but technology was advancing and as steampowered vessels increasingly replaced sail in the s and s the fluky inland winds of puget sound became largely irrelevant to navigation if steamships didnt have to stop at port townsend for customs inspection they often didnt stop at all hopes for a shipbuilding industry did not pan out due mostly to the early exhaustion of the supply of suitably tall trees from nearby forests no doubt for the same reason the areas first large sawmills went in not at port townsend but at port ludlow  miles to the south and at port gamble on the kitsap peninsula to the east nor did the arable land near the city produce enough to support an agricultural export trade of any appreciable size although port townsends wharves also handled produce from other area communities the mix of activities supported steady if very slow growth and by  there were  port townsend businesses listed in a regional directory the first brick home owned by hiram parrish  was built in  with bricks made in happy valley by s m eskildsen  by  the population had increased to  but faster growth elsewhere made the city again only the seventhlargest in the territory port townsend was surviving even growing somewhat but it was losing ground to other territorial population centers the railroad problem one person who did not share brownes and smiths dyspeptic views of port townsend was james g swan originally from massachusetts he had spent three years on shoalwater later willapa bay on the washington coast and then served as secretary to isaac stevens when stevens was a territorial delegate in washington dc swan moved to port townsend in  and described the community he found during the last eight years the growth of the town has been gradual but permanent and it now numbers  inhabitants there are between fifty and sixty buildings in the place   there are two good wharves  and the facilities for business accommodation are equal to any i have yet seen in the territory   if mr brownes report was correct there certainly has been a wonderful change for the better the beachcombers and outlaws as mr brown designated the inhabitants  with very few exceptions  have left the place almost out of the world  the citizens of port townsend placed much of their hope for the future on the coming of the railroad and like those in many other pioneer towns they would suffer bitter disappointment perhaps no one suffered more than swan who for nearly  years struggled to link his city by rail to the wider world he was seemingly well placed to do so he served from  to  as an agent of the northern pacific railroad hired to study and recommend sites for a western terminus that would extend the companys line northward from portland into the rapidly growing puget sound region swan of course recommended port townsend but in  the railroad ignored his advice and chose tacoma despite this disappointment between  and  port townsends population grew by nearly  percent to  while this looks impressive enough in isolation during the same decade seattles population increased by more than  percent tacomas by nearly  percent and spokanes by nearly  percent people were pouring into the northwest but the vast majority of them were settling somewhere other than port townsend nevertheless dreams of a rail link persisted and some of the towns leading citizens eventually decided to take matters into their own hands on september   the port townsend  southern railroad was incorporated and announced plans to run tracks south to hood canal then on to olympia the hope couched more as a promise to prospective investors was that one of the major railroads would see this as an opportunity take over the completed line tie it in with the transcontinental system and empower port townsend to compete with the downsound cities that were fast outstripping it in every quantifiable category rights of way were purchased in  and construction began in early  but the money ran out after a mere mile of track was laid later in  the year washington gained statehood the union pacific offered to make port townsend the northern terminus of its transcontinental line if it could acquire the port townsend  southerns franchise and rights of way and if the city kicked in  the citizenry was swept again by railroad dreams and the towns newspaper the leader predicted this day means a great deal more to us than we are aware of at present   port townsend will now get its share of the wealth and commerce of europe that annually finds its way hither and has heretofore passed us by city of dreams  some outsiders were more cleareyed but no one was listening in an  report prepared for the seattle lake shore  eastern railway which also was looking to expand attorney w h ruffner summed up the fundamental geographical nature of the problem the location of port townsend puts that town out of the general competition   a report on washington territory there simply was no compelling economic rationale for a rail link to the stillremote tip of the quimper peninsula but dreams die hard the union pacifics conditions were met and on october   a groundbreaking ceremony two miles west of town drew practically the entire population to hear speeches proclaiming impending glory work was to begin simultaneously at portland and port townsend and everyone looked forward to the day the two would join ending port townsends isolation and realizing its longheld ambitions property values soared and in  alone realestate transactions in port townsend totaled nearly  million and this in a city with barely  residents before that year was out the city boasted six banks six drygoods stores six hardware stores  hotels  real estate offices and three streetcar lines flush with optimism port townsend started to build an impressive new city hall on the corner of water and madison streets fittingly as it would turn out the contract to start railroad construction south from port townsend was let on april fools day  by june  men were at work a depot roundhouse and railyard were being built on landfill at kah tai lagoon at the south end of the city and by september there were trains running daily to leland lake about twenty miles away while the rails were heading south out of town two grand symbols of optimism were rising in the city on the bluff above downtown construction began in  on the romanesque jefferson county courthouse complete with a foot clock tower it opened late the next year beneath the bluff at the corner of madison and water streets the new city hall also opened in  both buildings were added to the national register of historic places in the early s and both were renovated in the first decade of the twentyfirst century despite all the apparent progress things were starting to go badly wrong in the south union pacifics subsidiary the oregon improvement company had been devoting its energies to unsuccessful land speculation rather than laying track and it went into bankruptcy receivership in  in the north the railroad was completed as far as quilcene where according to railroad historian steve hauff somebody noticed that mount walker was there they found there was really no way to get around this and that was the end of it railroads gone   and the end it was at least of any realistic hope that port townsend would become a leading city in the young state on the heels of the local railroad debacle came the national financial meltdown known as the panic of  which was triggered with particular irony for port townsend by railroad overbuilding and debt commerce in the city slowed to a near stop and the bay became a watery warehouse for a fleet of unused vessels left to slowly rot at anchor property values plummeted like the railroads the city had drastically overbuilt downtown buildings stood vacant streetcar lines were torn up and all but the most avid and unrealistic city boosters fell silent the city had a brief bright moment in march  when the federal government completed the port townsend post office court and customs house on the bluff above downtown construction had begun in  and the steel and brick sandstoneclad building was finished several years late and several times over budget it was an impressive edifice but almost contemporaneous with its dedication people started abandoning the city in droves between  and  nearly onefourth fled leaving behind a population of less than  port townsend would never again be counted as one of the  most populous cities in the state and it fell into a deep and prolonged decline there would be brief outbursts of train hysteria in later years unrealistic dreams sustained by little more than rumor and vestigial boosterism the little line to quilcene ran on until the s almost always at a loss and was said to have changed ownership more than any other railroad in the entire country a triangle of fire few could have been more disappointed than james swan but he was an optimist by nature and before he died in  he was able to perform one last service for the city he loved the federal government had seen little need for heavy fortifications on northwest waterways but in  the puget sound naval station was established at bremerton and it required protection fort townsend was too far from admiralty inlet to do much good and had been heavily damaged in a fire it was closed in  kicking another small crutch out from under the struggling city but the following year congress passed a huge allotment for military fortifications and swan who was widely respected and had many contacts in washington dc lobbied hard to bring some of that money to port townsend while the extent of his influence cannot be accurately judged the federal government decided to built three forts that together could cover admiralty inlet with triangulated artillery fire  fort casey on whidbey islands admiralty head across from port townsend fort flagler on the north end of marrowstone island and fort worden on the northern outskirts of port townsend at point wilson all were substantially completed by  and fort worden was designated coastal defense headquarters these facilities did not lead to great prosperity for the city but their construction and presence did provide a lifeline when it was most needed over the ensuing years the forts economic contributions varied with their state of activation in threatening times and during war troop levels increased and the local economy benefited in peaceful times or times of government belttightening the forts were more lightly manned and nearby communities suffered they were no replacement for the boost a rail link would have brought but they helped keep port townsend alive when it had few other prospects the mill and the military the forts modest boost helped the citys population to increase between  and  albeit by barely  souls but the military presence may have been a mixed blessing a comprehensive study of the citys educational system in  noted the fever of old boom days has not been completely lost from the blood the will to work at the immediate task is not fully present and the presence of the military with its easy money tends to keep alive the feeling of a glorious past that will surely come again lull  this may have been a subjective and overly harsh conclusion but the report did highlight a very real threat to the citys future the most universal remark which one hears from the young people and from the old too is this why should a young man remain in port townsend there is nothing for him to do here  port townsend is now playing a losing game it is educating its young people for a life that they will lead elsewhere lull  the bleakness of the situation should not be overstated however the sun still shone on port townsend and the beauty of its natural setting made up for much many residents were solidly middleclass by the measure of the day and a fortunate few got rich like any city port townsend had its share of murders scandals mysterious disappearances divorces and other events to keep the citizenry entertained but for most of the first  years of the twentieth century and particularly after the customs headquarters moved to seattle in  it lay largely outside the flow of historical events a small quiet city on a quiet peninsula it enjoyed a brief moderate boom during world war i but by  the population had fallen back to  the lowest since the mids in  county voters approved the formation of a public port district but a persistent lack of financing ensured that it would accomplish very little until the s some in port townsend may still have dreamt of greatness but the decades of false hope had taken their toll finally in  a single large stable employer came to town the zellerbach corporation of san francisco through its subsidiary national paper products company announced in july of that year that it would build a kraftpaper plant at glen cove about three miles down the bay from point hudson the plant would require vast amounts of fresh water and port townsend promptly applied for and received water rights to the big quilcene and little quilcene rivers in addition to providing immediate construction jobs and longterm employment opportunities the company absorbed much of the cost of rebuilding the citys aged watersupply system more than  workers were hired to build the plant the new water system was activated on october   and the mill started production the next day in  the crown zellerbach port townsend mill as it was then called had  employees and an annual payroll of  of equal importance the gravitational pull of such a large enterprise drew a wide range of supporting businesses to the city by  the population had rebounded to  up nearly  percent over  and the largest census count since the boom times of  to the great satisfaction of those with long memories port townsend remained relatively prosperous throughout the dark years of the great depression and for the first time in many decades was the object of some envy in  the citys population reached a new high of  and it increased further with the arrival of approximately  military personnel after americas entry into world war ii in december  the war brought prosperity the crown zellerbach mill ran  hours a day and soldiers from the three nearby forts spent their leave and their money in town by  the population had grown to  but the stimulus provided by the military tapered off with demobilization and ended with the closure of the forts fort flagler and fort worden closed permanently in  and fort casey in  all became state parks and continued to benefit the region as tourist attractions fort worden gave the city an additional if temporary economic boost in  when it was used as a location for the hit movie an officer and a gentleman due to the fort closures by  the citys population had fallen by more than onequarter to  and many in port townsend must have felt the boomandbust history was being dismally repeated but there was one big difference this time  the paper mill stayed it remained the countys largest employer and still supported a bevy of related businesses once again the city clawed its way back and after the setback of  the population grew in every census reaching  in  a city in amber the building boom of the s and early s left port townsends downtown streets lined with impressive buildings characteristic of the period and a number of its notable mansions remained wellpreserved the predominant styles were variations of latevictorian architecture many of the downtown buildings sat empty for years but relatively few were destroyed either for lack of funds or lack of other uses for the property they sat on left largely untouched they eventually proved to be of considerable benefit in  seattle architect and preservationist victor steinbrueck  gave a lecture in port townsend sponsored by the citys art league and chamber of commerce he told the assembled port townsend is a museum and you are the caretakers city of dreams  his words were taken to heart and the city first drew on its architectural legacy in january  with a showing of just one of its historic homes the saunders house at the south end of town the organizers of this first homes tour expected two or three hundred visitors at most nearly  showed up causing a huge traffic jam it was clear they were on to something the homes tour became an annual event of increasing popularity and the people of port townsend quickly came to realize that their city however inadvertently had preserved the only largely intact victorian seaport on the west coast beginning in the early s the city the port of port townsend and others worked to gain official recognition for the historic waterfront and the nineteenthcentury residential area located on the bluff above downtown both were placed on the national register of historic places in  and a year later the area encompassing them was designated a national historic landmark district as was the former military base at fort worden it was also in  that the city hosted north americas firstever wooden boat festival at the point hudson marina owned and operated by the port district and this led to the  creation of the wooden boat foundation which sponsored the event in later years always drawing crowds in the thousands in  the foundation opened its northwest marine center sponsor of everything from boatrepair classes to regattas and home to the wooden boat chandlery a onestop shop for boat lovers by  in addition to the historic landmark district port townsend had at least  individual buildings listed on the national register of historic places the largest employer remained the crown zellerbach mill but a thriving boatbuilding industry  everything from small wooden sailing craft to large megayachts  had developed along with numerous facilities large and small for ship repair as the citys charms became more widely known it drew increasing numbers of retired people and emptynesters and many brought with them the desire and the means to help port townsend preserve its heritage in  the city was awarded the great american main street award a national prize recognizing preservationbased economicrevitalization efforts several of the citys historic houses were converted to bedandbreakfasts and in its wellpreserved downtown district visitors shopped for everything from antiques to zucchini in  a major restoration of the nineteenthcentury city hall home since  to the jefferson county historical society was completed the first  years of port townsends history were a roller coaster of high hopes big gambles bad breaks and deep disappointments with the coming of the zellerbach mill in  the city settled into a long period of relative economic stability but with greatly lowered expectations while dreams of becoming the new york of the west did not come close to realization most who live in port townsend today surrounded by the areas natural beauty and the wellpreserved architecture of the past would probably say that

of f and t townsend made machines for george beardslee from on lifes stage the autobiography of adam ainslie written in  and published in  by the city of cambridge ontario archivesthere being no steam engines made in canada i crossed over to rochester and went down the erie canal to albany and visited messr townsend who had a large foundry there and enquired their terms for making machinery for a steam saw mill to cut ten thousand feet of lumber per day i then proceeded to new york and made a like enquiry at a large foundry there finding the terms of the albany firm the most favorable i returned there and in the office of messr townsend drew a contract by which they bound themselves to furnish me with the requisite machinery by a certain date for the sum of  before signing the agreement they suggested that as i was a stranger and might not take the machinery when made i must make a deposit of  i thought this but reasonable and gave them a cheque for the amount upon mr ewart the agent of the commercial bank at dundas ontario after getting mr battle the foreman of the works to draw a plan of the proposed mill for which i paid him  i returned to galt and engaged michael knox norman ramsay and john graham to chop  acres on the beverly lot viz the pines into logs for the mill and the hard wood for the engine they put a shanty on the lot performed the work for which i paid and also for digging the foundation of the millhaving proceed so far a new light dawned upone me which was that altho the mill might cut the number of feet per day the purchasers would pay me in promissory notes due one year after date and then probably not be paid while engineers and laborers would expect their wages monthly i concluded to drop the whole concern like a hot potato i informed messr townsend of this my resolution they replied stating that when they had disposed of the machinery they had made they would account to me for the balance but i never received a cent of the
