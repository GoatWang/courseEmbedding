in new brunswick new jersey  the heath care giant professes to put the people before profits its mission statement called “our credo” begins with “we believe our first responsibility is to the doctors nurses and patients to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services” but those harmed by the megacorporation’s products might question this credo despite jj’s accolades and its success the company has also had its fair share of scandals government investigations drug and device recalls and lawsuits related to products that injured thousands of people in fact a notable investigation by steven brill for huffington post highline called jj “america’s most admired lawbreaker” the history of johnson  johnson the three johnson brothers — robert james and edward — founded the company in  in new brunswick new jersey their initial focus was on bandages sterile sutures wound care and baby products their firstaid kits originally sold to railroad workers would later become a staple in nearly every household they also sold women’s health products including sanitary protection products and maternity kits with firstaid products to assist in home births jj celebrated its th anniversary in  bandaids and baby powder jj employee earle dickson invented bandaid adhesive bandages in  the first selfapplied dressing for small wounds sold commercially frederick kilmer the director of jj’s scientific affairs from  to  was renowned for pitching antiseptic methods for treating wounds he distributed a booklet with a summary of doctor and surgeon views on wound care another of his accomplishments was marketing talcum powder to soothe skin and selling it as baby powder birth control revolution from  to  under the leadership of thenceo philip hofmann jj sold birth control and personal care products and a treatment for schizophrenia early on jj subsidiary ortho developed the first prescription contraceptive gel and in  ortho manufactured birth control pills called orthonovum which helped launch the birthcontrol pill revolution in the united states the birth of an iconic pain reliever jj acquired two key companies in  cilag chemie in europe and mcneil laboratories in the united states mcneil developed the first aspirinfree pain reliever tylenol children’s elixir tylenol comes in various pill and capsule forms a year later the medication was available over the counter and became the most recommended pain reliever by pediatricians the next year jj marketed the drug to adults by the s tylenol was the leading painkiller medication in the us the drug remains one of jj’s most iconic recognizable brands its active ingredient acetaminophen is included in a number of overthecounter and prescription medications janssen ethicon and depuy orthopaedics in  jj acquired janssen pharmaceuticals which had begun as a small research laboratory in belgium in  dr paul janssen and his team discovered new medications to treat pain help with mental illness fight infection and treat digestive problems janssen is known as one of the most innovative and prolific researchers of the th century his discoveries include fentanyl an anesthetic reasec diarrhea treatment and haldol schizophrenia — which enabled patients to live at home rather than in an institution jj’s subsidiaries ethicon and depuy orthopaedics allowed the company to expand into surgical products and orthopedic implants janssen pharmaceuticals became jj’s marketer and manufacturer of blockbuster prescription drugs including invokana canagliflozin for type  diabetes risperdal risperidone an antipsychotic and xarelto rivaroxiban a blood thinner jj started ethicon as a suture business in  one of ethicon’s innovative products was a disposable skin stapler which allowed the company to enter the mechanical wound closure business throughout the s ethicon developed minimally invasive surgery techniques where small incisions allow patients to heal quicker one of these tools for minimally invasive surgery — the power morcellator — helped surgeons perform complex surgeries with less blood loss and shorter recovery times depuy orthopaedics joined the long list of jj subsidiaries in  when the drug maker bought the medical device company for  billion depuy manufactures hip and knee implants and other medical devices stents and hiv treatment another surgical endeavor jj invested in was the palmazschatz stent the first coronary stent julio palmaz designed the stent and sold the patent to jj jj provided the funds to finish developing the idea and then market it this new product kept vessels open to allow blood to reach the heart and revolutionized cardiology jj purchased pfizer’s consumer health care unit in  bringing in products such as listerine for bad breath lubriderm for dry skin rogaine for hair loss bengay for sore muscles and more the company remains focused on global concerns such as hivaids it acquired tibotecvirco bvba a company dedicated to helping people with hivaids tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in  the tylenol crisis the tylenol crisis of  was one of jj’s most challenging recalls it also provided a blueprint for future mass recalls the company showed it was a master at reputation management in the face of bad publicity in  seven people in chicago died after taking extrastrength tylenol laced with cyanide according to reports an unknown suspect took the product from shelves added cyanide and returned the products to the shelves tylenol recall jj recalled  million bottles of tylenol at a loss of more than  million jj immediately recalled  million bottles of tylenol at a loss of more than  million but never discovered who had tampered with the seven bottles tylenol had  percent of the pain reliever market prior to the crisis after it fell to  percent to recover from the massive blow to its reputation jj reintroduced tylenol with tamperresistant packaging offered discounts and sent an army of more than  salespeople to doctors’ offices to restore confidence in the product after jj’s efforts tylenol regained most of its market share climbing to  percent then ceo james e burke got credit for leading the company through the crisis and restoring tylenol’s reputation the risperdal controversy jj’s antipsychotic risperdal risperidone made billions for the company it also saddled them with thousands of lawsuits including a criminal fine of  million for questionable marketing tactics documents revealed in lawsuits show how the company encouraged and incentivized its sales staff to illegally target doctors and clinics that treated children and the elderly — knowing that the drug could kill seniors and wasn’t proven safe or effective in children jj created risperdal to make up for haldol’s loss of patent it all began in  when jj’s profitable antipsychotic haldol haloperidol lost patent the company needed another multibilliondollar blockbuster drug to replace its lost revenue risperdal was the answer however the fda only approved the drug for use in schizophrenic adults — a very small part of the population in order for the drug to be successful millions of people would have to use it jj knew it had to sell its drugs for additional uses to the elderly and children the drug giant wanted to market risperdal as superior to haldol and include comparisons on risperdal’s drug label the fda disagreed dr robert temple an fda clinical trial specialist called the strategy unacceptable because it would lead “to the conclusion that risperdal has been shown to be superior to haldol when in fact it has not” the fdas stance didn’t stop jj from continuing to propose risperdal for use in the elderly and children the fda continued to refuse to allow these uses on the drug’s label in fact risperdal’s early clinical trials in children and the elderly found a high number of side effects some serious — including an increased risk of stroke and heartrelated problems in the elderly selling risperdal to doctors and nursing homes if jj couldn’t get fda approval it would make its sales goal by using doctors to recommend it to their patients while manufacturers cannot legally market a drug for off label — a use not approved by the fda — doctors are allowed to prescribe a drug for any use then risperdal sales manager alex gorsky led the sales team and provided strategy to sell risperdal gorsky is now the company’s ceo we started looking hard for ways to go after these customers — pediatricians nursing home doctors mental health facilities even school guidance counselors we had to a former janssen salesman told journalist steven brill jj began paying doctors in  to push risperdal and get it put on preferred medicaid drug lists and it worked for example in texas medicaid spent  per patient with generic haldol after jj pushed risperdal in  it spent  per patient risperdal salespeople then went into nursing homes and the offices of pediatric psychiatrists they paid millions of dollars in rebates and fees to omnicare pharmacists in return for risperdal sales to nursing homes salespeople incentivized doctors to prescribe risperdal in exchange for paid speaking engagements they distributed literature saying that risperdal was safe and effective for “treating hostility in the elderly” the company also minimized any mention of side effects including a large number of deaths by the end of  risperdal made  billion a year for jj about half of the sales came from selling the drug to children and the elderly jj guilty of misbranding risperdal for over a decade jj reaped the benefits of misbranding risperdal raking in billions in  the department of justice ordered jj to pay more than  billion “to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from allegations relating to the prescription drugs risperdal invega and natrecor including promotion for uses not approved as safe and effective by the food and drug administration fda and payment of kickbacks to physicians and to the nation’s largest longterm care pharmacy provider” jj’s janssen unit “janssen admitted that it promoted risperdal to health care providers for treatment of psychotic symptoms and associated behavioral disturbances exhibited by elderly nonschizophrenic dementia patients” it did not admit guilt in pushing the drug to children but it agreed to pay fines associated with the charge the company also faces close to  lawsuits filed by the families of children who say the drug caused gynecomastia — female breast growth in boys jj’s problematic drugs and medical devices risperdal wasn’t the only problematic jj product among the millions of products johnson  johnson sold over the years several pose a serious risk to consumers in lawsuits internal documents surfaced showing jj and its subsidiaries knew about problems but sold the products anyway after reports of complications from consumers and physicians the fda legal experts and patients themselves have taken action against jj the company faces more than  lawsuits for its defective products hip implants depuy jj’s medical device subsidiary was one of the first device manufacturers to use a metalonmetal hip design it introduced the pinnacle hip replacement system in  the asr hip resurfacing system sold internationally in  and the asr xl acetabular system in  depuy pinnacle systems have been used in up to  us patients as have  asr products but the metal ball and cup components rub together and can release metal ions into the bloodstream causing metallosis or metal poisoning patients may also experience loosening of the implant or joint dislocation and may require additional surgeries because of problems with the implants and serious injuries to patients the fda investigated asr and pinnacle implants depuy recalled the asr implants and discontinued the pinnacle implants learn more transvaginal mesh in the late s ethicon and several other device manufacturers introduced vaginal mesh implants these products were designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse pop and stress urinary incontinence sui conditions experienced by older women following menopause childbirth or a hysterectomy in  nearly  us women received a transvaginal mesh implant many women experienced debilitating side effects from the implants including perforation of organs vaginal bleeding and scarring mesh erosion and severe pain ethicon stopped manufacturing several of its mesh products in august  including its gynecare prolift kit gynecare prolift  m kit gynecare tvt secure and gynecare prosima pelvic floor repair system kit internal documents unsealed as a result of litigation in  suggest jj sold its proliftm mesh in  without proper fda clearance in fact the fda requested jj stop selling the device but the company left it on the market the fda finally cleared the device in  but it did not take corrective action against the device maker bloomberg reported learn more power morcellators ethicon is one of a number of companies that manufactured power morellators the devices used during hysterectomies and fibroid surgeries in women can cause hidden uterine cancer to spread the result can be a rapid development of the disease which can be deadly the fda warned the morcellators could increase the development of cancer in women in  and jj pulled its devices from the market the same year in early  the federal bureau of investigation began an investigation into the company’s knowledge of the device’s risks the government accountability office also began an investigation into the fda’s clearance of the devices after members of congress claimed the devices may have harmed thousands of women learn more invokana invokamet and invokamet xr janssen developed the type  diabetes drug invokana the first sodiumglucose cotransporter  sglt inhibitor to receive fda approval approved in  the fda began noticing problems with invokana in  the agency warned sglt inhibitors can cause a deadly condition called ketoacidosis in which the body produces dangerous acids called ketones the fda has since issued several more safety communications for invokana including a black box warning for an increased risk of foot and leg amputations learn more jj’s multibilliondollar drug pipeline legal worries and controversy has not slowed the drug giant in may  jj announced it had  new drugs in its development pipeline with billiondollar potential some of the diseases these drugs could treat include depression prostate cancer solid tumors rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and influenza the drugmaker says the fda has not yet approved these drugs but they could be well on their way to megadrug status by  author michelle llamas michelle y llamas is a

advertising to sway lawmakers the fda and the public to increase sales the public is exposed to pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising for example critics say abbvie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as androgel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men they created a marketing campaign around the condition “low t” that featured a quiz for men to selfdiagnose low t symptoms androgel above was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up the testosterone market soared into the billions as a result but few studies back up drugcompany claims that the drug significantly enhances mood vitality and sexual performance studies also link these drugs to heart problems the fda added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to big pharma

prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed journal of the american medical association jama actively vie for the attention of big pharma advertising dollars billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug according to propublica’s dollars for docs investigation  companies paid  billion to doctors and hospitals from august  to december  drug and device company payments to doctors from select companies august  to december  company payments depuy johnson  johnson  million stryker corporation  million astrazeneca  million pfizer  million janssen pharmaceuticals  million glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesbig pharma fraud settlements in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud according to public citizen’s  report pharmaceutical industry settlements  through  fact in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud the most common charge involved drugpricing scams against state medicaid programs this meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while big pharma made billions unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements but these investigations take many years to complete by then drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion while the us department of justice fine is typically only a few million
