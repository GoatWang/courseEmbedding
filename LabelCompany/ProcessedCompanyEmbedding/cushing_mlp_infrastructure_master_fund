be the two largest products in the space circumvented this restriction in different ways amlp was structured as a c corporation as opposed to an openend mutual fund while amj was structured as an exchangetraded note in choosing these two paths the two products drew a massive line in the sand and forced investors to make a number of tradeoffs a third version appeared in  with the launch of the first trust north american energy infrastructure etf emlp which uses a traditional mutual funds structure and bears the dilutive consequences understanding the pros and cons of each structural choice is the key to evaluating the etp options in the mlp space perhaps even more than understanding things like the exposures of the tracked indexes or the efficiency of each product this truly makes mlp etps unique its the one asset class in which the way the etps are structured matters as much—or more than—what they actually hold the c corporation an individual master limited partnership passes through income and any other distribution to shareholders untaxed which makes them great yield vehicles but because of the restrictions on holding mlps in a mutual fund its difficult to create a great highyield mlp mutual fund product one way to get around this is to structure your etp as a c corporation there are currently seven mlp etps on the market that are structured as c corps ticker fund name net expense ratio assets millions amlp alerian mlp   ymlp yorkville high income mlp   mlpa global x mlp   ymli yorkville high income infrastructure mlp   zmlp direxion zacks mlp high income   mlpj global x junior mlp   amza infracap active mlp   ”as of”  as the name suggests these funds are actually just companies—like apple or exxon as plainold corporations they can hold any asset any company can including stakes in any limited partnerships they like the tradeoff for this is that they must pay corporate income taxes typically  percent whats worse even after paying those taxes any income distributions made to shareholders are just like any distributions paid by apple—theyre dividends and will be subject to taxes on their shareholders returns the accounting for that taxation is why the expense ratios in the table above look so high – those tax liabilities are an expense of the fund if this double taxation sounds terrible it is and detractors love to point to this double taxation as a way of saying mlp ccorp etps are a bad idea its important to remember however that underlying mlps make two kinds of distributions income and return of capital anything classified as return of capital is not taxed rather it simply lowers an investors cost basis in the mlp that returnofcapital status is passed through the ccorp structure to the investor so far the majority of dividends paid by the industrys leading ccorp etf amlp have been eligible to be treated as returnofcapital distributions much like the distributions of the underlying mlps themselves  percent in   percent in  thats taxfree yield but it may come at a price because return of capital lowers your cost basis investors will realize higher tax liabilities when they sell further these taxdeferral benefits are completely lost when you hold a ccorp etf in a deferred account such as an ira the distributions from a ccorp etf made within an ira will be treated as any other distribution and wont lower the cost basis of the shares held within said portfolios another key consideration for those considering a ccorp mlp etf is their investment horizon and its implications for estate planning although the taxdeferred nature of distributions means the cost basis in the etf will be lowered each time a return of capital is made the tax code allows for a step up in cost basis when shares are inherited resetting the basis to fair market value and effectively avoiding all capital gains on the estate transfer as such investors seeking to invest in mlps via the etp wrapper indefinitely—with an estate plan in place—may favor the ccorp structure due to this step up in basis on the other hand investors with shorter investment horizons will neither realize this inheritance tax break nor will they derive much benefit from the more straightforward deferral of taxation one last wrinkle—cost basis can never go below zero so if you hold a highyielding ccorp mlp etp long enough distributions may wipe out your cost basis and all future payments will be taxed in the worst possible way—as ordinary income the etn structure there are currently  different mlp etns to choose from ticker fund

ccorporation etfs mlp etns are exceedingly simple like all etns they are simply a debt instrument issued by a bank the notes do not represent any beneficial ownership in actual mlps—they dont own anything anymore than your tbills own anything they are merely a promise to pay the return of an index of mlps to satiate those who come to the mlp space for income mlp etn issuers have built their products to make coupon payments that mimic the distributions of the mlps in the index the problem of course is that these payments are just bond coupons distributions from mlp etns are taxed as ordinary income while changes in price are treated as capital gains just like any other bond this has the advantage of simplicity unlike direct ownership of the mlps investors are not partners in the etn and dont have to file a k statement with their income taxes unlike the ccorpbased etps distributions are never double taxed whether theyre income or return of capital as a result etns tend to outperform when a greater share of distributions are income the downside for etns is counterparty risk because etns are just unsecured debt in the event of bankruptcy etn holders could theoretically lose all of their money just like any bondholder since an etn only provides replicative returns rather than representing fractional ownership in any actual mlps total return is of paramount importance for etn holders whether those returns are driven by distributions or index appreciation means significantly less to etn investors since there is no tax deferral available as such investors who expect distribution growth to be a relatively lesser component of their total returns would favor the etn wrapper traditional mutual fund structures whereas the ccorporation and etn structure each ask you to make significant tax tradeoffs to get diversified mlp exposure emlp and two other recently launched  act etfs ask you to accept a different tradeoff ticker fund name net expense ratio assets millions emlp first trust north american energy infrastructure   mlpx global x mlp  energy infrastructure   enfr alerian energy infrastructure   ”as of”  since the tax code prevents these funds from holding more than  percent in mlps these products offer diluted exposure to actual lp interests in mlps they either own institutional mlp shares which pay stock dividends or own general partnership interests which both increase concentration and carry lower yields the remainder of the portfolio is made up of everything from utilities firms to canadian energy firms that the index providers have deemed to have similar characteristics to mlps unfortunately this means none of these funds provides a perfect proxy for a diversified basket of mlps but rather an energy infrastructure portfolio with a smattering of lp interests in mlps the good news is these funds dont have to deal with double taxation or counterparty risk conclusion ultimately investing in mlps is a challenge no matter how you approach it etp packages achieve many laudable goals including offering diversified and liquid exposure in a single wrapper but its important to understand the tradeoffs youre making when acquiring each product if you’re comfortable with the significant research burden and complex taxation issues there’s much to be said for direct ownership of mlps close send to separate multiple email addresses

at market price which may be higher or lower than their nav and are not individually redeemed from the fund investments in publicly traded mlps involve risks and considerations that may differ from investments in common stock tax complexity risk master limited partnerships mlps are generally considered passthrough entities for tax purposes and have special tax considerations passthrough entities may generate unrelated business taxable income ubti that may have undesirable tax consequences for retirement accounts and other taxexempt investors if you hold mlp units you are generally treated as a partner for tax purposes and will be issued a schedule k form  rather than a form  form for use in filling out your tax return a k lists the partners share of income deductions credits and other tax items if the mlp has operations in multiple states you may need to file a separate tax return in each state an mlp that is treated as a corporation in the united states rather than a passthrough entity for federal income tax purposes would be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate in this case the amount of cash available for distribution by the mlp would be reduced and part or all of the distributions made could be taxed entirely as dividend income in this case a form  would be furnished rather than a schedule k please see the mlp’s website sec filings or most recent shareholder report for further details about tax treatment of your investments legislative risk the tax treatment of publicly traded mlps could be subject to potential legislative judicial or administrative changes possibly on a retroactive basis any such changes in tax treatment could negatively impact the value of an investment in an mlp concentration risk many mlps are concentrated in the energy infrastructure sector this narrow focus of mlps may present considerably more risk than a diversified investment across numerous sectors of the economy market risk mlps may exhibit high volatility particularly during periods of economic stress or due to other events impacting the particular sector or industry in which an mlp operates interest rate risk the market prices of mlps are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates rise the prices of mlp units may decline and vice versa rising interest rates could also increase the mlp’s cost of capital which may limit potential growth through acquisition or expansion and reduce distribution growth rates distribution policy risk all or a portion of an mlp’s distribution may consist of a return of capital from your original investment mlp unit holders should not assume that the source of a distribution is net profit from the mlp’s operations liquidity risk despite the fact that mlps are publicly traded investments in mlps may be relatively illiquid due to their unique investment strategy asset concentration or other factors lack of liquidity can negatively impact your ability to sell mlp units additionally should a secondary market exist investors who need to sell mlp units may be subject to a significant loss commodity price risk the price of mlp units may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices a significant decrease in the production or supply or sustained reduced demand for natural gas oil or other energy commodities would limit revenue and cash flows of mlps and therefore the ability of mlps to make distributions to unit holders regulatory risk the assets of mlps tend to be heavily regulated by federal and state governments changes in regulation can adversely impact an mlp’s profitability and therefore the value of mlp units conflicts of interest the general partners of an mlp typically have limited fiduciary duties to the mlp and may have conflicts of interest which could result in the general partners favoring its own interests over the mlp’s interests before investing consider the funds investment objectives risks charges
