global website audit ai ensures efficient highprecision aroundtheclock auditing the kibit ai has learned the investigative techniques used by auditors and uses these to extract relevant emails as well as automatically learning from audit results it provides a visual representation of inherent risk incredibly cheaply accurately and speedily homesolutionsaudit overviewas a measure to address the legal risk of companies concerning electronic communication through email etc we have utilized our past knowledge and investigational experience along with the latest technology developed inhouse to establish an unparalleled “aibased audit method” email has become the most common means of transmitting information in recent years so the importance of email auditing for companies is growing rapidly however it is difficult to examine and audit the immense volume of daytoday email traffic manually so existing email auditing processes have been a barrier to countering legal risks such as international litigation the leakage of confidential information and unauthorized trading kibit has learned the investigative techniques used by auditors and uses these to extract relevant emails as well as automatically learning from audit results it identifies and analyzes risk incredibly cheaply accurately and speedily in a way that was thought to be impossible with conventional technologies data leakage kibit promptly identifies signs that confidential information is being leaked as a result of internal malpractice and prevents technologies and confidential sales information being taken to domestic or overseas competitors by employees an issue of lifeordeath importance to japanese companies analysis of past cases has shown us that there are three phases in deliberate data leakage “cultivation” “preparation” and “execution” the perpetrator’s motivation to leak data is fostered during the “cultivation” phase by using email audits to identify emails expressing grievancesdissatisfaction with the company or referring to money worries which are indicative of this phase companies can prevent internal malpractice before it reaches the “execution” phase during which prevention is much more difficult combating cartels and activities that violate antimonopoly laws in recent years a number of companies have fallen afoul of us antitrust law laws prohibiting and restricting the restraint of trade which is analogous to japan’s antimonopoly act resulting in large fines and in the worst cases the imprisonment of employees kibit has learned the investigative techniques used by auditors so it can identify differences in nuance that were hard to detect via email filtering based on ordinary keyword searches by identifying emails that refer to playing golf or going drinking with employees of rival companies which are indicative of the “building a relationship” and “preparation” phases companies can prevent the formation of cartels combating accounting fraud bribery and activities that violate the fcpa as corporate transactions become increasingly borderless countries across the globe are stepping up their efforts to unearth dishonest practices involving the bribery of public officials abroad the us fcpa and the uk’s bribery act have been tightened up as have antibribery regulations in china japan and russia among others with a consequent increase in both the number of prosecutions and the total value of fines our aibased solution to combat accounting fraud bribery and activities that violate the fcpa detects the counterparts in staff transactions and the bribery of public officials abroad this prevents corruption which can lead to the imprisonment of staff if unearthed by the authorities voice analysis designed for the finance industry the finance industry seeks to strengthen frameworks for managing corporate information and prevent insider trading and data leakage via information management of not only electronic data but also many other storage media the task of dealing with voice data is still thought to be something that can only be carried out by a human listening to the actual recording this places a tremendous
