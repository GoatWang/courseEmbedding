love love it reply judy johnson says may   at  pm you need to have steve step away from the spotlight and give more time to the little stars i hope the producers listen as this is a common thought of many people reply amanda says april   at  pm note to the producers and cameron in week to ninja watch the kids for form we don’t turn in to watch these make a fool of himself with the camera on him 0 of the time the little girl who is on there to yoda we never did get to hear her yoda but we got to hear steve show his ass reply stacy brinkley says may   at  pm a little harsh don’t you think reply linda k says march   at  pm god bless you this is so much better than politicians reply jacqueline high says february   at 0 am how did you go about selecting talent for the show are you still looking

shots” it’s due to make you smile  get the warm fuzzies watching the unbelievable natural talents of these little phenoms reply deborah wilson says october   at  am this show will be great i have a great nephew has a mind of his own and can quote many sayings of dr martin luther king the talents to sing and dance sit at a piano with the look of john legend dance moves of hammer the coolness of a preacher if that is not a combination i would love to get more info about the auditions and needed criteria to possibility to participate on the showhe is eight but you wouldn’t believe it reply bernadette walcott says october   at 0 pm i am extremely thrilled about the idea of little big shots my daughter and my niece are very talented in singing they perform at concerts and in church however my daughter is too young for american idol or the voice she is only years old and have a voice that raised the roof i would love for her to audition for the show please let me know how where and when auditions begin steve and ellen you are geniuses reply samanthadegouttes says october   at  pm i love ellen and steve im extreamly talented reply kaya says september   at  am i love both of them i would love to dance on that show because i am a dancer😆😆 how do you sign up reply shareka says august   at  pm how do you sign up a child reply ronnie lesley says may   at  pm will not let my kids watch this crap reply stacy brinkley says may   at  pm then keep that opinion to your self if it’s so bad why are you even saying anything at all hater’s save it reply kaya says september   at  am you are just a but head because this could make some kids big reply yeah me again says may   at  pm so apparently it isn’t enough that children are already exposed to her daytime liberal and homosexual evangelism if you want to brainwash those little minds you have to train them young and often with daily reinforcement hey hollywood – just leave the kids alone enough is enough as for harvey turns out that he’s just a hypocrite when money hangs in the balance reply dennis says may   at  pm yeah me again – i agree with every word you said i’ll just add that ellen appears demonic if you look at her eyes and steve harvey is an incredible sellout embarrassing really hope this is a fail reply nick s says may   at  pm steve harvey is a nutbag do they have any idea who they’re hiring reply mistle says may   at  pm apparently steve harvey will do anything for a buck or team up with anyone for a buck reply kaya says september   at  am you are a hater because your not at his level so what you need to do is look up to him and study him to get there hater ted says may   at  am nbc is as well aware of who they’re hiring as are you and i big moneymakers for the network television is a business reply sam payne says may   at  pm taking the place of the voice between fall and spring i think it will reply thybountyhunter thybountyhunter says may   at  pm i can’t watch anything with steve harvey in it at all i just can’t trust someone whose morals come from the threat of eternal damnation from some god you know if his morals came from himself then i might be able to trust him reply dennis says may   at  pm “morals came from himself” – you’re ridiculous reply stacy brinkley says may   at  pm i think the kids who are translators are amazing maybe they should be recognized the show is amazing jtdigitalvideo says may   at 0 pm you are a hater love it… so jealous of his life reply doug says may   at  pm oh great a kids show being created from the likes of ellen “degenerate” what a great role model she is… not reply yeah me again says may   at  pm to brainwash them they need a lot of access to them at a young age hollywood’s denizens know exactly what they are doing – this is no accident reply d says may   at  pm you know what an executive producer is right she doesn’t talk to the kids or go near them in the context of the show her job is to produce the show she sits in an office and manages the look and feel of the show writes out the themes for the episodes and directs the staff if she talks to the kids its as she passes them by off stage there’s handlers for the kids special security because federal laws state kids have to be supervised by a licensed handler even if parents are there too stage managers directors censors makeup people sound people security and whole mess of other people who’s job it is to get the kids readynoff the stage the majority of her contact will be with the people who work for her and the parents of the children fed up says may   at  am sorry universal i been used to style projects which have been sold to your company for the past five years and some of my scripts have been used violated and used in your movies i have never been paid for this and today i got baliffs coming round and a lot of the time i go hungry coz if i do other work to pay the bills they abuse me in the contracts too plus they selling my writing work everywhere so really by now i should be getting paid too i just wondered what i should do when the baliffs come should i send them to these people’s offices who been making money out of me reply lou d says may   at  am after reading your comment i find it very hard to believe you’ve ever written a script your grammar is atrocious as are your sentence structures you are obviously trying to make yourself something you are not and you failed miserably… reply guy smiley says may   at  pm by the looks of your writing nobody has ever used your “scripts” for anything unless you were writing a memior called “the illiterate high school dropout” i have a hard time believing you’ve ever written word in your life before this comment reply see all  comments more tv news
