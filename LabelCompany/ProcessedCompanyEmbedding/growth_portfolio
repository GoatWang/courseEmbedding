the fund at a given time return on capital is a measure of a company’s efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments calculated by dividing net income minus dividends by total capital earnings per share eps growth is the weighted average of earnings per share growth for all securities in the portfolio projected for the past five fiscal years earnings per share for a company is defined as total earnings divided by shares outstanding weighted median market capitalization is the point at which half of the market value of a portfolio is invested in stocks with a greater market cap and consequently the other half is invested in stocks with a lower market cap debtequity de is a measure of a company’s financial leverage calculated by dividing its total liabilities by stockholders’ equity sales growth is the increase in sales over a specific period of time often but not necessarily annually turnover is sourced from the funds current prospectus the

fraction of the portfolio or fund that is invested differently than its benchmark as of the last day of the reporting period a portfolio with a high degree of active share does not assure a fund’s relative outperformance alpha is the excess return or value added positive or negative of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the markets upward or downward movements a beta greater than  identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market while a beta less than  identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market the beta of the market is always equal to  information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk as measured by tracking error versus

determines reward per unit of risk the higher the sharpe ratio the better the historical riskadjusted performance standard deviation measures how widely individual performance returns within a performance series are dispersed from the average or mean value tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark risk considerations there is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks in general equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as

placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them liquidity risk investments in medium capitalization companies tend to be more volatile and less liquid than those of larger more established companies morningstar rankings the

returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods ratings do not take into account

is essential for investors conducting equity research by investors or analysts supporting internal corporate financial planningbreakproduct portfolio is an important element of financial analysis because it provides context and granularity investors can distinguish between longterm value stocks and short term growth opportunities portfolio analysis also allows investors to nail down specific drivers of financial performance which is necessary for effective modelingproduct portfolio and mature companiesmature companies often have diversified product portfolios internal product development and acquisitions contribute to portfolio size over time and larger enterprises have the infrastructure to support the marketing of a broader offering geographic expansion can also augment a product portfolio with products varying in popularity among cities or countries diversification tends to limit growth potential while reducing downside risk so mature firms tend to exhibit less operational volatility this reduces the amount of speculation in equity valuation the proctor  gamble company is an example of such a company with  different wellknown personal and household goods brands including bounty crest and tideproduct portfolio and growth companiesyounger firms with small portfolios are more exposed to the performance of their main products which can lead to greater operational volatility more risk and higher growth potential lead to more speculative equity valuation the various components in a product portfolio often have disparate margins because they have different price dynamics production costs or marketing demandsportfolio and profitabilitythe various components of a portfolio also face different market dynamics and can contribute inconsistently to

horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire
