generations of ancestors some chandlers of androscoggin and oxford counties maine thricerelated only a genealogist could be impressed by it my four legged stool the strength of my soul and upon it i shall rest welcome  we all have unique four legged stools each leg an extension from our grandparents who contribute to our being at conception our entire biology stems from our forebears the history that preceded us our environment first from within the womb then from without people and events often beyond our control shape us further if history does repeat did our forebears experience what we now are experiencing and if so will we react as they once did and if our biological bonds forget will random energy pulses trigger a memory cord  as of december   the immigrant is available for sale by clicking the envelop icon in the upper right or by mailing to myfourleggedstool publishers po box  oak bluffs ma  or by visiting amazoncom on this site are several register formatted diligently footnoted papers on my or my wife jills four legged stools my paternal grandparents surnames are woollacott and williams and my maternal ones are nault and young jills are chandler and hart germond and chamberlain respectivelywhile i lack any drop of blood in my veins from those last four surnames our children do and those four form two of their legs so yes in a general sense we are both  english and  french with our french coming from our mothers fathers links to our seven generation fan charts are below to give you other surnames in our genealogy here is my fan chart  uploadsancestorfanofalfredwoollacottjpgand here is jills uploadsancestorfanofjillchandlerjpgthe charts like the genealogical journey they reflect have holes and are always being refined some ancestors who preceded the seven generations shown are known but not presented others who are shown lack basic information reflecting the varying comfort levels of my research thus far  if their published genealogy is under the sections alfreds four legged stool or jills four legged stool then my comfort is extremely high but for others further research may be needed before i reach a near certain comfort thus i am loathe to put my over  names on my legacy file onto the internet since i could be  perpetuating misinformation so if some surnames pique an interest send me an email and we can discuss them further some of my grandchildren are members of the wampanoag tribe of aquinnah gay head their heritage which is on my legacy file contain surnames of baird cook madison and vanderhoop among others so if your interest is with the tribe i can tell you what i have but perhaps better i can direct you to people who are more knowledgeable than i on tribal ancestrythe immigrantone from my four legged stool published december much of my working life was spent gathering facts to support assertions useful for my new found passion of genealogical research but data transcription can grow tedious while snippets of an ancestor’s life grow fascinating and  relating them to an era simply captivating so with some imagination anchored in fact and tempered with plausibility ancestors can achieve more robust lives as envisioned by a writer with a few drops of their blood in his veins all our ancestors lived when momentous events occurred some experienced them up close and personal ever wonder what they might have been thinking under the timelines section are my thoughts as seen through my ancestors eyesthree situations have intrigued me such that my wonderment has driven me to create historical narratives my first historical narrative the immigrant  which is about my sevengreats grandfather john law was completed in  there is a tab devoted

ancestors some chandlers of androscoggin and oxford counties maine thricerelated only a genealogist could be impressed by it alfred woollacott iii my genealogical journey began while chauffeuring jill her mother and two of their octogenarian cousins around england in  as i lay awake i said to jill once i retire im going to work on my family tree she yawned while saying boy all these castles churches and cemeteries have really gotten to you she slammed her head back down on the pillow for a bit more rest  in  i retired from kpmg a firm where i had spent my entire career spanning some  years when a fellow partner asked al youre too young to retire what are you going to do now i responded what i have always done except i wont be going to work filling in the  to  hour per week void that retirement created was easy believe me retirement is highly underrated i honored the vow i made while in england and dabbled with my family history until a post on a genealogy website from a charles hb cole looking for information on the fitchburg woollacotts captured me charless work was extensive i was even in it in no time the woollacott leg of my stool was far extended i was hooked on family history and needed more when my brother and i traveled to devon in  we had a lovely lunch with charles and his family after lunch charles calculated that we were th cousins like a dutiful auditor i checked his calculations  he was correct i told him about the lovehate relationship with genealogy that he had created within me he laughed and i sensed he knew what i was experiencing when his wife added that while on their honeymoon charles was in the library doing genealogy i was certain that charles knewmy maternal grandmother attended dar meetings in peterborough so i contacted their new hampshire chapter and gave them the name of grace belle young nault born  july  within a week i knew my patriot a private reuben law my initial fleeting thought   just a private i guess its no order of cincinnati for me but as i researched him further i found a private reuben law in the acton militia who was at the concord bridge on april th that had to be him how many reuben laws could there be  and then i wondered what was going through the mind of a  year old on that morning that thought was not fleeting but hauntingmy adult life was spent crunching numbers and verifying assertions so researching dates and concluding on supporting evidence comes easy to me i received a b s in business administration  and later an mba  both from boston university english literature composition and creative writing were not in my college education and at kpmg creative writing was strictly forbidden  just the facts and then a conclusion so transporting my wonder about an ancestor out of my head and onto paper does not come easy but thanks to local writers like john hough jr and cynthia riggs who teach adult continuing education ace on the vineyard grub street workshops and others i am learning but its never easy  i do the friday and saturday wall street journal crossword puzzles it is a rare day when i can complete a puzzle in one sitting but after several iterations i eventually achieve success creative writing is similar a paragraph or scene is rarely right with just one pass but unlike crossword puzzles you re never sure if you have ever gotten it completely rightso now my family history dabbling has become an obsession with dates and places stuck to my head like tossed velcro balls hanging from a fuzzy dart board and the wonder why it just permeates continuously i have spoken on genealogy to audiences and students who think they might be interested in beginning their journeys as i look at the sea of innocence and think of an eager class action lawyer lurking i feel compelled to offer the budding genealogists a cigarette pack warning lest i might get suedcaution genealogical research can become habit forming and may result in obsessive compulsive behaviorso what causes the obsession under the section timelines the dates of january  and september  might give you insight on mine if you get started you will find answers for your obsession one of my genealogical journeys led me to the robust taggart family website on that site i found this quote “a people which takes no pride in the noble achievements of remote ancestors will never achieve anything worthy to be remembered with pride by remote descendants”  thomas b macauley   perhaps macauley was right and if so perhaps that is why we become so obsessed above is a grandfather who like the edited photograph is fading to a remote ancestor but sitting on his leg is his granddaughter his future who also is destined to fade with time to become a remote descendant

writing in register format was for a massachusetts society of genealogists inc msog writing contest since i was beginning a trilogy on three ancestors i figured that writing about them in register format would be a good first step and rather easy to do boy was i ever wrong but thanks to the efforts of helen s ullmann i finally produced something worthy of publication i have an enormous respect for those researcher who document meticulously their research and i continually strive to be like them whether when writing in register format or simply documenting an ancestor for my personal data basemy second effort again for msog was about my great grandfather john woollacott he met the criteria for the contest an immigrant around the turn of the last century who  worked in a mill the contest in concert with the th anniversary of the  bread and roses strike at the mills along the merrimack river in lawrence massachusetts that strike was instrumental in changing child labor laws that were virtually nonexistent before  i always enjoy looking at old photographs as they  evoke so many images study any photograph of a young child working the mills at the turn of the last century and you will appreciate better that hackneyed expression a picture is worth a thousand wordsin  my brother and i visited our old sod high bickington devon england where there are more woollacotts than smiths at the conclusion of our trip i decided that a slew of photographs and accompanying negatives in paper wallets would soon be lost to the ages so i made a genealogical lite photo journal of our trip it has a greater likelihood of being found dusted off and perused than dogeared paper wallets of old photographsmy woollacott leg is very complete from my fourgreats grandparents john and mary down woollacott forward it gets sketchier as i journey further back even though high bickingtons yelland farm and woollacott have a connection from  to the present day thanks to the wolcott family

thought was not fleeting but hauntingmy adult life was spent crunching numbers and verifying assertions so researching dates and concluding on supporting evidence comes easy to me i received a b s in business administration  and later an mba  both from boston university english literature composition and creative writing were not in my college education and at kpmg creative writing was strictly forbidden  just the facts and then a conclusion so transporting my wonder about an ancestor out of my head and onto paper does not come easy but thanks to local writers like john hough jr and cynthia riggs who teach adult continuing education ace on the vineyard grub street workshops and others i am learning but its never easy  i do the friday and saturday wall street journal crossword puzzles it is a rare day when i can complete a puzzle in one sitting but after several iterations i eventually achieve success creative writing is similar a paragraph or scene is rarely right with just one pass but unlike crossword puzzles you re never sure if you have ever gotten it completely rightso now my family history dabbling has become an obsession with dates and places stuck to my head like tossed velcro balls hanging from a fuzzy dart board and the wonder why it just permeates continuously i have spoken on genealogy to audiences and students who think they might be interested in beginning their journeys as i look at the sea of innocence and think of an eager class action lawyer lurking i feel compelled to offer the budding genealogists a cigarette pack warning lest i might get suedcaution genealogical research can become habit forming and may result in obsessive compulsive behaviorso what causes the obsession under the section timelines the dates of january  and september  might give you insight on mine if you get started you will find answers for your obsession one of my genealogical journeys led me to the robust taggart family website on that site i found this quote “a people which takes no pride in the noble achievements of remote ancestors will never achieve anything worthy to be remembered with pride by remote descendants”  thomas b macauley   perhaps macauley was right and if so perhaps that is why we become so obsessed above is a grandfather who like the edited photograph is fading to a remote ancestor but sitting on his leg is his granddaughter his future who also is destined to fade with time to become a remote descendant create a free website powered by ✕ woollacott alfred iii top holdings whalewisdom search all search f filers only search

details fictionalized life of authors ancestor on the frontier of the new worldby jack shea  january   share on facebook tweet on twitter the immigrant one from my four legged stool a first novel by alfred woollacott iii from myfourleggedstool publishers oak bluffs  pages paperback  available at bunch of grapes in edgartown and online at amazoncom read this bookalfred woollacott iii an oak bluffs resident has written an extraordinary first novel set in the midth century the book chronicles his ancestor  john law a yearold boy caught up in a scottish civil war and the man he becomes as an english prisoner of war sold into indenture in the massachusetts bay colony town of concordthe immigrant is a terrific read because it succeeds on its literary merit wellplotted with substantive characters redolent with details of life on the frontier of the new world  john law’s travails put the reader in his hardscrabble life contending with bigotry penury and the unforgiving new england climate in the days before diversity electric blankets and supermarkets the immigrant is rooted in a  postretirement project mr woollacott undertook after a career at global accounting firm kpmg he spent years researching his family tree and wrote a genealogy of his forebears then he decided as he told the times this week “to put some leaves on the tree” based on the rich store of information he had amassed“furnished with facts i began to fictionalize their lives” mr woollacott writes in the acknowledgments to the immigrant for that work he signed up with john hough jr island author and writing coach mr hough has a dedication to fine detail in replicating past events and environments which gives his books a realtime feel for readers the youarethere quality is evident in mr woollacott’s work herethe actual john law was a yearold boy in dunbar a coastal town in southeast scotland young law cared for his widowed mother in that rural community which also happened to be in the path of oliver cromwell’s british forces intent on subduing rebel covenanters supporters of the scots’ king charles ii law is enlisted as a pikeman to face cromwell’s army is captured in the scots’ defeat and was likely sent to the massachusetts bay colony as an indentured servant law is greeted with disdain and bigotry by the selfrighteous english colonists and is assigned grueling tasks as a wood chopper and collier until he gets his big break as a shepherd tending sheep on the outskirts of concord where he meets the local native americans who are leery but more accepting than the british colonists the puritans’ behavior toward the indentured scots and the indigenous people would enrage a stone statue and may provide us with insight into the reason they were shown the door by england a generation earliermr woollacott brings a taut spiritual dimension to the immigrant law’s search for a father figure his shame at not being able to care for his mother as he had promised his father and his efforts to resolve his uncertain view of a just and merciful god make a continuing and heartfelt dialogue as the immigrant fights for his place and for his family in a strange landmr woollacott has done painstaking research into the culture and laws of puritan massachusetts particularly as they related to land ownership we learn that some were ethical but many were bernie madoff actalikesthe author expresses his story in his own view that our lives are similar to a fourlegged stool representing our maternal and paternal ancestors who shaped us in the foreword mr woollacott asks “did our forebears experience what we are now experiencing and if so will we react as they once did”we get a sense of that in an opening chapter flashforward when reuben law john’s greatgrandson musters at the concord bridge in  to fight the british thinking the same thoughts john law thought  years ago at dunbarmr woollacott plans a trilogy based on his family’s doings those laws and woollacotts are a zesty bunch turns out that naamah carter an earlyth century family aunt from peterboro nh and reuben law’s granddaughter was one of brigham young’s  wives and went to utah to find a paradise that was not forthcomingmr woollacott is currently looking for a publisher for his story he reports that  publishers sent “no interest” letters in response to the immigrant oops their bad my guess is that none of them read it my hunch is that aunt naamah will have suitorsmr woollacott will be reading from the immigrant on saturday february  at  pm at the oak bluffs library and on saturday march  at pm at the west tisbury library both events are free and open to the public related articlesmore from author arts  entertainmentministers to the moth campground comes to life with events all
