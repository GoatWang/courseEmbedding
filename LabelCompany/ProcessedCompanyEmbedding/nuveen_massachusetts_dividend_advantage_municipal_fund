predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency however such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail

common share net income but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful  different forms of leverage including swaps may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limitsinverse floater risk the fund invests in

there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful  derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount investedmunicipal bond market liquidity risk inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years either due to brokerdealer choices or to federal banking regulations reducing their ability to make a market in these securities this may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs particularly during periods of economic or market stress as a result the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired to sell other securities to raise cash or to give up

insured dividend municipal advantage fund insured dividend the sec staff reviewed and commented on insured dividends registration statement file nos   relating to mtp shares the insured dividend registration statement subsequently nuveen has filed mtp shares registration statements the previously filed registration statements for each of  additional funds the previous funds and requested selective review for portions of each of those registration statements that were identical to or substantially identical to the insured dividend registration statement as we have discussed the rights and preferences of the mtp shares issued by insured dividend are identical to the mtp shares to be issued by each of the january funds furthermore insured dividend and each of the january funds share the same board of trustees officers investment adviser legal counsel both special counsel and special massachusetts counsel independent registered public accounting firm transfer agent custodian and redemption and paying agent as a result the prospectus disclosure items set forth below are identical or substantially identical among the insured dividend registration statement and each of the

investment objectives and policies investment restrictions portfolio composition portfolio manager in the prospectus and statement of additional information comprising each of the january registration statements are not substantially identical to those in the insured dividend registration statement given the different investment focus of these funds the tax disclosures in the two statespecific january registration statements differ from the disclosures made in the previously filed registration statements to the extent that the disclosure addresses state tax consequences of investing in mtp shares in addition the two statespecific january funds have retained special legal counsel to advise on statespecific risk disclosure and tax disclosure identical or substantially identical disclosure
