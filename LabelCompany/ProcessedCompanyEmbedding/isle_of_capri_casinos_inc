                                      adjusted ebitda is earnings from continuing operations before interest and other nonoperating income expense income taxes stockbased compensation preopening expenses and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is  a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming industry and  a principal basis of valuing gaming companies management uses adjusted ebitda as the primary measure of the companys operating properties performance and it is an important component in evaluating the performance of management and other operating personnel in the determination of certain components of employee compensation  adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the companys operating performance as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company has significant uses of cash flows including capital expenditures interest payments taxes and debt principal repayments which are not reflected in adjusted ebitda also other gaming companies that report adjusted ebitda information may calculate adjusted ebitda in a different manner than the company a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to income loss from continuing operations is included in the financial schedules accompanying this release certain of our debt agreements use a similar calculation of adjusted ebitda as a financial measure for the calculation of financial debt covenants and includes add back of items such as gain on early extinguishment of debt preopening expenses and noncash stock compensation expense reference can be made to the definition of adjusted ebitda in the applicable debt agreements on file as exhibits to our filings with the securities and exchange commission   adjusted income loss is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure as this is one method management reviews and utilizes to analyze the performance of its core operating business  for many of the same reasons mentioned above related to adjusted ebitda management believes adjusted income loss and adjusted income loss per share are useful analytic tools as they enable management to track the performance of its core casino operating business separate and apart from factors that do not impact decisions affecting its operating casino properties such as loss on early extinguishment of debt and preopening expenses  management believes adjusted income loss and adjusted income loss per share are useful to investors since these adjustments provide a measure of financial performance that more closely resembles widely used measures of performance and valuation in the gaming industry  adjusted income loss and adjusted income loss per share do not include the loss on early extinguishment of debt and preopening expenses  on september   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with eldorado resorts inc whereby eldorado will acquire all of the outstanding
