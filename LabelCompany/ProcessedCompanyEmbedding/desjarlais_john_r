entirely new therapeutic mechanisms of action xencor’s broad portfolio of optimized fc domains can plugandplay into nearly any antibody xmab fc domains provide enhanced performance in  proprietary and partnered therapeutic antibody programs in clinical development for the treatment of autoimmune disorders cancer asthma and allergic diseases management bassil i dahiyat phd president and chief

his bs and ms in accounting from the university of illinois partneringpartners broaden the pipeline of xmab drug candidates the plugandplay nature of xencor’s xmab technology enables the rapid creation of more powerful more effective antibodies by simply changing a few amino acids in the fc domain to the amino acids identified by our structurebased design typically two amino acids are changed to create the xmab fc domain and dramatically enhance the biological function of the antibody xencor’s growing pipeline is based on this plugandplay approach to creating differentiated antibody drug candidates xencor extends the use of the xmab technology through licenses of these highperformance fc domains to partners interested in therapeutic targets outside of xencor’s areas of focus currently partners are advancing seven programs in clinical trials and numerous preclinical programs that use xmab fc domains for bispecific structure higher cytotoxicity longer halflife or improved stability please direct partnering inquiries to collaboratexencorcom current partners include novartis licensed exus commercial rights and entered a collaboration for the worldwide development of xmab and xmab and began a collaboration to use xmab bispecific fc domains across  novartis programs novartis also licensed various xmab fc domains to optimize the performance of therapeutic antibodies xencor and amgen entered into a collaboration to use xmab bispecific fc domains across six programs in cancer immunotherapy and inflammation including cdxcd bispecific antibodies discovered at xencor for myeloma xencor’s xtend and cytotoxic fc domains are helping janssen optimize performance of its therapeutic monoclonal antibodies merck has licensed xencor xmab
