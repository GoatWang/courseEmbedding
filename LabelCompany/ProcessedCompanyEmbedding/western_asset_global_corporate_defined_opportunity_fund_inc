our philosophy  portfolio management longterm fundamental value markets often misprice securities prices deviate from fundamental fair value but over time they adjust to reflect inflation credit quality fundamentals and liquidity conditions consistently investing in undervalued securities can deliver superior investment returns we can systematically identify mispricings we believe we can identify and capitalize on markets and securities that are priced below fundamental fair value we do this through disciplined and rigorous analysis comparing prices to the fundamental fair values estimated by our macroeconomic and credit research teams around the globe our portfolios emphasize our highest convictions the greater the difference between our view of fair value and markets pricing the bigger the potential value opportunity the greater the degree of confidence in our view of fundamentals the greater the emphasis of the strategies in our portfolios multiple diversified strategies we seek diversified sources of returns our objective is to meet or exceed our investors performance objectives within their tolerances for risk we seek to diversify investments and add value across interest rate duration yield curve sector allocation security selection country and currency strategies we deploy multiple diversified strategies that benefit in different environments so no one strategy dominates performance helping to dampen volatility research  webcasts  western asset home about us our firm investment philosophy risk management client service environmental social and
