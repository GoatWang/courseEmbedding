scientific rationale  geron telomerase scientific rationale nobel prize winning science cell division plays a critical role in the normal growth maintenance and repair of human tissue telomeres are repeated sequences of dna at the ends of each chromosome and are key genetic elements involved with the regulation of cell division telomeres shorten every time a cell divides and once telomeres reach a critically short length the cell either dies by apoptosis or stops dividing and senesces telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that maintains telomeres and prevents them from shortening during cell division telomerase consists of at least two essential components an rna template which binds to the telomere and a catalytic subunit with reverse transcriptase activity which adds the specific dna sequence to the chromosome ends each time a cell divides telomeres telomerase telomerase is repressed in most normal cells allowing telomere length to gradually decrease and preventing uncontrolled proliferation in tissues that have a high turnover throughout life such as blood and gut telomerase can be transiently upregulated in progenitor cells to maintain telomeres and enable controlled selflimited proliferation to replace cells lost through natural processes as the progeny of progenitor cells mature telomerase is downregulated and telomeres shorten with cell division preventing uncontrolled proliferation the  nobel prize for physiology or medicine was awarded for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase the nobel laureates were early geron collaborators elizabeth blackburn carol greider and jack szostak a hallmark of cancer a fundamental trait of cancer cells is the ability to sustain chronic and uncontrolled proliferation as described in the recent paper “hallmarks of cancer” telomerase expression has been found to be present in approximately  of biopsies taken from a broad range of human cancers through the abnormal and sustained upregulation of telomerase malignant cells acquire cellular immortality and avoid apoptosis enabling the continued and uncontrolled proliferation that drives tumor growth and progression normal cells cancer cells a molecular target in oncology we believe that inhibiting telomerase may be an attractive approach to treating cancer because it may limit the proliferative capacity of malignant cells hematologic or blood cancers arise from malignant progenitor cells in the bone marrow and may be particularly susceptible to telomerase inhibition telomerase activity has been observed to be significantly increased and the average telomere length to be significantly shorter in patients with certain hematologic malignancies compared with healthy individuals in addition high telomerase activity has been associated with shorter overall survival of patients in some hematologic malignancies we developed imetelstat as a potential cancer treatment to inhibit telomerase

thiophosphoramidate nps oligonucleotide that has a covalently bound ’ palmitoyl c lipid group the proprietary nucleic acid backbone provides resistance to the effect of cellular nucleases thus conferring improved stability in plasma and tissues as well as significantly improved binding affinity to its target the lipid group enhances cell permeability to increase potency and improve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties the compound has a long residence time in bone marrow spleen and liver imetelstat binds with high affinity to the template region of the rna component of telomerase resulting in direct competitive inhibition of telomerase enzymatic activity rather than elicit its effect through an antisense inhibition of protein translation imetelstat is administered by intravenous infusion imetelstat imetelstat bound to telomerase preclinical studies with imetelstat a series of preclinical efficacy studies of imetelstat have been conducted by geron scientists and academic collaborators these data showed that imetelstat inhibits telomerase activity and can shorten telomeres inhibits the proliferation of a wide variety of tumor types including solid and hematologic in cell culture systems and rodent xenograft models of human cancers impacting the growth of primary tumors and reducing metastases inhibits the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells from hematologic cancers such as multiple myeloma myeloproliferative neoplasms and acute myelogenous leukemia has additive or synergistic antitumor effect in a variety of cell culture systems and xenograft models when administered in combination with approved anticancer therapies including radiation conventional chemotherapies and targeted agents clinical experience with imetelstat over  patients have been enrolled and treated in imetelstat clinical trials phase  six clinical trials evaluated the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics both as a single agent and in combination with standard therapies in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies single agent studies of imetelstat were in patients with advanced solid tumors multiple myeloma and chronic lymphoproliferative diseases combination studies with imetelstat were with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer and with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc doses ranging from  mgkg to  mgkg were tested in a variety of dosing schedules ranging from weekly to once every  days the human pharmacokinetic profile was characterized in clinical trials of patients with solid tumors and chronic lymphoproliferative diseases singledose kinetics showed dosedependent increases in exposure with a plasma halflife t ranging from  hours residence time in bone marrow is long  µm observed at  hours post  mgkg dose telomerase inhibition was observed in various tissues where the enzymess activity was measurable phase  imetelstat was studied in two randomized clinical trials two single arm proofofconcept studies and an investigator sponsored pilot study randomized trials were in combination with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer and as maintenance treatment following a platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen in patients with nsclc single arm studies were as a single agent or in combination with lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma and as a single agent in essential thrombocythemia et or polycythemia vera pv an investigator sponsored study was as a single agent in patients with myelofibrosis mf or myelodysplastic syndromes mds safety and tolerability the safety profile of imetelstat across the phase  and  trials has been generally consistent reported adverse events aes and laboratory investigations associated with imetelstat administration included cytopenias transient prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time aptt assessed only in phase  trials gastrointestinal symptoms constitutional symptoms hepatic biochemistry abnormalities and infusion reactions hematologic myeloid malignancies early clinical data including molecular responses in et and remissions including reversal of bone marrow fibrosis in mf suggest imetelstat may have diseasemodifying activity by inhibiting the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones for the underlying diseases proofofconcept in essential thrombocythemia a phase  multicenter single agent and open label trial was conducted in  patients with et to provide proofofconcept for the potential use of imetelstat as a treatment for hematologic myeloid malignancies such as mf mds or aml published results baerlocher gm

with a jak vf gene mutation achieved  to  reductions in allele burden and qualified as partial molecular responses mpl and calr mutant allele burdens were also reduced by  to  the nature of adverse events reported were similar to those reported in other imetelstat clinical trials with fatigue gastrointestinal symptoms hepatic biochemistry abnormalities and cytopenias being the most frequently observed pilot study in myelofibrosis an open label single agent investigator sponsored pilot study of  patients with intermediaterisk or highrisk mf including  who had received prior therapy with a jak inhibitor was conducted at a single center published results tefferi a et al a pilot study of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat for myelofibrosis n engl j med  sep   are summarized as follows seven of   patients achieved a complete or partial remission bone marrow fibrosis was reversed in all four patients who had a complete remission and a molecular response also occurred in three of the four patients median duration of complete remission was  months range seven months to  months spleen responses by palpation lasting greater than  weeks were observed in eight of   patients spleen responses were observed in three of   patients from the jak inhibitor experienced subgroup the most clinically significant adverse events were hematologic myelosuppression was the primary reason for the protocolmandated dose reduction that occurred in  out of  patients  pilot study in myelodysplastic syndromes an open label single agent investigator sponsored pilot study of nine anemic patients

inhibitor imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies imetelstat is currently being tested in two clinical trials imbark™ a phase  trial in myelofibrosis mf and imerge™ a phase  trial in myelodysplastic syndromes mds these clinical trials are being conducted by janssen biotech inc under a collaboration and license agreement in which janssen were granted the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology including hematologic myeloid malignancies and all other human therapeutic usestelomerase is an enzyme that enables cancer cells including malignant progenitor cells to maintain telomere length which provides them with the capacity for limitless uncontrolled proliferation using geron’s proprietary nucleic acid chemistry imetelstat was designed as an oligonucleotide that targets and binds with high affinity to the active site of telomerase thereby directly inhibiting telomerase activity and impeding malignant cell proliferation early clinical data including molecular responses in essential thrombocythemia et and remissions including reversal of bone marrow fibrosis in mf suggest imetelstat may have diseasemodifying activity by inhibiting the progenitor cells of the malignant clones for the underlying diseases recent newsmore datetitle may  geron corporation reports first quarter  financial
