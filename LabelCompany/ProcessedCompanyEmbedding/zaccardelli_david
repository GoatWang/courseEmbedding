his significant experience as we continue to grow the company said prabhavathi fernandes phd president and chief executive officer of cempra dr zaccardelli received his doctor of pharmacy from the university of michigan about solithromycin solithromycin is a highly potent nextgeneration macrolide the first fluoroketolide which has potent activity against most macrolideresistant strains in vitro and in vivo studies have shown potent activity against s pneumoniae as well as an extended spectrum of activity against communityacquired methicillin resistant s aureus camrsa streptococci haemophilus enterococci mycobacterium avium and in animal models of malaria it is also active against atypical bacteria such as legionella chlamydia mycoplasma and ureaplasma and against gonococci and other organisms that cause genitourinary tract infections it is  times more potent than azithromycin against many bacteria and is active against azithromycinresistant strains solithromycins activity against resistant strains is driven by its ability to interact with three sites on the bacterial ribosome compared to one for current macrolides the binding to bacterial ribosomes and interaction with three ribosomal sites is expected to limit the development of bacterial resistance to solithromycin about communityacquired bacterial pneumonia communityacquired bacterial pneumonia cabp is the number one cause of death from an infection particularly in the very young and in the elderly cabp is one of the most commonly diagnosed bacterial infections in the us resulting in  to  million cases per year although many strains of the primary cabp pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae are resistant to currentlyapproved macrolides this class of antibiotic remains among the most commonly prescribed antibacterial drugs for cabp in both the hospital and community settings due to the rising threat of microbial resistance along with concerns over antibiotic tolerability and impact on
