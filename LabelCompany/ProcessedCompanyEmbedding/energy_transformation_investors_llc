energy  chemical energy  nuclear energy  mechanical energy  energy conversion  reflection  summary  assignment  reading  web resources introduction energy is the ability to do work it is one of the basic human needs and is an essential component in any development programme in this lesson we are going to look at the forms that energy exists namely heat light sound electrical chemical nuclear and mechanical these forms of energy may be transformed from one form to the other usually with losses objectives by the end of this lesson you should be able to describe the various forms of energy namelyheat light sound electrical chemical nuclear and mechanical describe how energy may be transformed from one form to another lesson content kalturawidget kalturaid sizem alignl heat heat energy also referred to as thermal energy is really the effect of moving molecules matter is made up of molecules which are in continual motion and in a solid vibrate about a mean position the motion of any molecule increases when the energy of the substance is increased this may cause an increase in the temperature of the substance or lead to a change of state the higher the temperature the greater the internal energy of the substance heat energy is the most easily lost or dissipated form of energy it is also the form of energy into which other forms of energy can easily change however heat can be changed into other forms of energy with a lot of wastealso called solar energy light sunset image provided by courtesy of flickr wwwflickrcomlight energy is a type of wave motion that is light is a form of energy caused by light waves it enables us to see as objects are only visible when they reflect light into our eyes sound sound energy is also a type of wave motion we are heard by others when we talk because of the sound energy we produce it is due to the effect of the air molecules vibrating when we talk the vibrating molecules hit our eardrums which enable us to hear others talk sound energy may be converted into electrical energy for transmission and later the electrical energy can be converted back into sound energy at the receiving end an example of such transformations could be seen in the microphone and the loudspeaker sound like heat energy is easily lost the transformation of one form of energy into another may be accompanied by losses in the form of sound andor heat that are often not desirable electrical energy transmission of electrical energy image provided by courtesy of flickr wwwflickrcomelectrical energy is really the effect of moving electrical charges from one point to another in a conductor electrical charges moving through a conductor is called electricity electrical energy may be easily changed into other forms of energy to suit our particular needs lightning is an example of electrical energy electric current is the means by which electrical energy is most easily transported to places where it is needed and converted into other forms chemical energy this is the energy stored within chemical compounds a chemical compound is formed by the rearrangement of atoms that is accompanied by energy loss or gain this energy is the chemical energy gained or lost in the formation of the compound food biomass fuel and explosives have a store of chemical energy the energy from food is released by chemical reactions in our bodies in the form of heat fuels like coal oil and natural gas contain chemical energy that may be converted into other forms of energy like heat and light the chemical energy present in a given fuel is determined by its calorific value – the heat liberated when  kg of the fuel is burnt batteries and explosives also contain chemical energy that could be converted into other forms of energy some beneficial others harmful nuclear energy nuclear energy also known as atomic energy is energy stored in the nucleus of an atom it is this energy that holds the nucleus together and could be released when the nuclei are combined fusion or split fission apart nuclear energy can be used for peaceful purpose as well as destructive purposes as in the atomic bomb considering peaceful purposes nuclear energy is used to generate electricity in nuclear power plants produce steam for driving machines powering some submarines and spacecrafts in these applications the nuclei of uranium atoms are split in a process called fission nuclear energy is also the source of the sun’s energy the sun combines the nuclei of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms in a process called fusion albert einstein put forward the following equation that provides the basis for calculating the amount of energy released when the nucleus of an atom is split e  mc the equation means that when the nucleus of an atom is split the amount of energy released e in joules is equal to the loss of its mass m in kilograms times the speed of light squared c in ms because c is a very large figure  x     a small amount of mass can be converted into an enormous amount of energy an atom of uranium splits into two smaller atoms and loses roughly  percent of its mass that is converted into a vast amount of energy onekilogram mass of any substance completely converted into energy equals  j or  billion kilowatt hours this is more than the electrical energy needs of the united states for two days mechanical energy mechanical energy is the kind of energy that can do mechanical work directly naturally occurring sources of mechanical energy include winds waterfalls and tides there are two kinds of mechanical energy namely kinetic energy and potential energy kinetic energy is the energy a body possesses by virtue of its motion a moving body of mass m kg and velocity v ms possesses kinetic energy of magnitudemv joules thus the magnitude of the kinetic energy of an object depends both the mass and the velocity of the object flowing water and winds have kinetic energy potential energy is the energy of a body due to its position or shape this form of energy could be considered as energy stored in a body to be released when it begins to move or change its position or shape quite often potential energy changes to kinetic energy a ball at the top of a slope water behind a dam a compressed spring and a stretched elastic band possess potential energy for a body of mass m kg located at a height h metres above a particular chosen level such as ground level or sea level its potential energy is mgh joules where g  acceleration due to gravity in ms for an elastic spring stretched x m its potential energy is kx joules where k  spring constant in nm energy conversion one important property of energy is its ability to change from one form to another form for example chemical energy from fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas can be converted into heat energy when burned the heat energy may be converted into kinetic energy in a gas turbine and finally into electrical energy by a generator the electric energy may subsequently be converted into light sound or kinetic energy in our homes through various household appliances during any energy conversion the amount of energy input is the same as the energy output this concept is known as the law of conservation of energy and sometimes referred to as the first law of thermodynamics this law states energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transformed from one form to another thus the total energy of an isolated system is always constant and when energy of one form is expended an equal amount of energy in another form is produced in every energy conversion some highgrade energy is converted into lowgrade energy as heat thus the total amount of lowgrade energy in the universe is increasing while highgrade energy is decreasing even though energy is never destroyed we usually complain that the world is suffering from an energy shortage indeed we are suffering from shortage of highgrade energy that has the potential of producing useful power energy may change form but the total amount of energy in the universe stays the same reflection let us consider the following energy transformations that we encounter on daily basis in our everyday activities when we turn on our flashlight chemical energy stored in the batteries is converted into light energy when we turn on the television electrical energy changes into light and sound even though undesirable some amount of heat is also produced when we move a vehicle the engine converts the chemical energy stored in the fuel into heat sound and kinetic energy note that the heat and the sound that are produced are not desirable when we talk on the telephone the sound we produce is first transformed into electrical energy by the microphone that is transmitted along wires in the case of cellular phones the sound is converted into electromagnetic waves and transmitted through the air the speaker of the phone on the other end changes the electrical energy electromagnetic waves back into sound energy an electric cooker in our homes changes electrical energy into heat and light as the hot plate gets hotter and hotter we see it glowing summary in this lesson we looked at the various forms in which energy may exist namely heat light sound electrical chemical nuclear and mechanical we also learnt that these forms of energy may be transformed from one form to the other usually with losses assignment describe to your junior brother in sss  the following forms of energy heat light sound electrical chemical nuclear mechanical reading garrat j  design and technology

style box reveals a funds investment style for equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii moderate greater than  and less than equal to  years iii extensive greater than  yearsunsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers the adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees including but not limited to
