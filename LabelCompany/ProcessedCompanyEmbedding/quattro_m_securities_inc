merrill lynch to me jimmy was the most influential broker to my professional development like most clerks when i started on the floor i believed there were many more years ahead however unfortunate this turned out not to be the case the things that i admired about james as a broker was his common sense his intelligence and his uncommon commitment to the clerks that worked for him although it is often a cliche in this case it is not jimmy is truly a team player i have no doubt that he will be an asset to the next organization he joinssee moresee lesssign up to see who recommended
