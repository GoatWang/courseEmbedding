loans ratio was  at september    at december   and  at september   in general the credit quality of the loan portfolio is improving in part due to improved economic conditions over the past twelve months however individual loan downgrades such as those noted above which will occur due to individual business circumstances slightly increased the allowance to total loan ratio for further information regarding loan quality statistics and the allowance for loan losses see the sections below under the heading financial condition titled asset quality and allowance for loan losses noninterest income for the three months ended september   amounted to  million an increase of  thousand or  compared to the same quarter last year this increase was primarily due to an increase in net gains on the sales of investment securities noninterest income for the nine months ended september   amounted to  million a decrease of  thousand or  compared to the nine months ended september   this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in net gains on the sales of investment securities partially offset by increases in deposit and interchange fees and income on bankowned life insurance

expense amounted to  million an increase of  million or  over the nine months ended september   increases in expenses over the prior year primarily related to increases in the companys strategic growth and market expansion initiatives particularly salaries and benefits and technology expenses sources and uses of funds the companys primary sources of funds are customer and brokered deposits federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings current earnings and proceeds from the sales maturities and paydowns on loans and investment securities the company may also from time to time utilize overnight borrowings from correspondent banks additionally funding for the company may be generated through equity transactions including the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan or exercise of

key components of interest earning assets amounted to  million at september   and comprised  of total assets at september   compared to  at december   enterprises main asset strategy is to grow loans the largest component of interest earning assets with a focus on high quality commercial loans total loans increased  million since december   and amounted to  billion at september   comprising  of total assets at september   compared to  at december   total commercial loans amounted to  billion or  of gross loans at september   which was consistent with the composition at december   managements preferred strategy for funding asset growth is to grow relationshipbased deposit balances preferably transactional deposits comprised of demand deposit accounts interest and business checking accounts

million with a correspondent bank borrowed fund balances fhlb advances and other borrowings have declined  million since december   brokered deposits comprised solely of cds have decreased  million or  during the nine months ended september   the companys level of wholesale funding has declined over the current year as deposit growth has exceeded loan growth opportunities and risks the companys ability to achieve its longterm strategic growth and market share objectives will depend in part upon the companys continued success in differentiating itself in the market place and its ability to strengthen its competitive position enterprise faces robust competition to attract and retain customers within existing and neighboring geographic markets national and larger regional banks have a local presence in the companys market area these larger banks have certain competitive advantages including greater financial resources and the ability to make larger loans to a single borrower numerous local savings banks commercial banks cooperative banks and credit unions also compete in the companys market area the expanded commercial lending capabilities of credit unions and the shift to commercial lending by traditional savings banks means that both of these types of traditionally consumerorientated institutions now compete for the companys targeted commercial customers in addition the nontaxable status of credit unions allows them certain advantages as compared to taxable institutions such as enterprise competition for loans deposits and cash management services investment advisory assets and insurance business also comes from other businesses that provide financial services including consumer finance companies mortgage brokers and lenders private lenders insurance companies securities brokerage firms institutional mutual funds registered investment advisors internet based banks nonbank payment and funding channels and other financial intermediaries consolidation within the industry customer disenfranchisement with larger nationalinternational banks banks exiting certain business lines andor markets the cost of compliance with new government regulations and the continued low interest rate environment have and are expected to continue to have an impact on the regional competitive market the company also faces increasing competition within its marketplace on the pricing of loans this is expected to be an ongoing competitive challenge however the company is committed to maintaining asset quality and focuses its sales efforts on building longterm relationships rather than competing for individual transactions or easing loan terms in addition the increased use and advances in technology such as internet and mobile banking nonbank payment channels electronic transaction processing and cybersecurity are expected to have a significant impact on the future competitive landscape confronting financial service businesses the companys business model is to provide a full range of diversified financial products and services through a highlytrained staff of knowledgeable banking professionals with indepth understanding of our markets

skills and function as trusted advisors to clients in addition enterprise carefully plans deposit expansion through new branch development identifying offices strategically located to complement existing locations while expanding the companys geographic market footprint in early july  our rd branch on route a in nashua nh opened and the company recently announced the anticipated opening of its th branch office in windham nh in  branch expansion is aimed at achieving not only deposit market share growth but also is intended to contribute to loan originations and generate referrals for investment advisory and wealth management trust and insurance services residential mortgages and cash management products management believes that enterprise is also well equipped to capitalize on

practices which have served to provide quality asset growth over varying economic cycles during the companys history the company has a skilled lending sales force with a broad breadth of business knowledge and depth of lending experience to draw upon supported by a highly qualified and experienced commercial credit review function table of contents the companys investment services including advisory customized investment management trust and brokerage services provide for additional income diversification the companys investment advisory and management services channel derives revenues

the clients comfort levels and exceeds their financial expectations the companys investment advisory team consists of a variety of certified financial and licensed brokerage professionals adept in a

investments in employee training and development marketing and public relations technology and electronic delivery methods ongoing improvements renovations or strategic relocation of existing facilities and the continued development of recently added branches industry consolidation also provides management the opportunity to recruit experienced banking professionals with market knowledge who complement the enterprise sales and service culture while management recognizes that such investments increase expenses in the short term enterprise believes that such initiatives are a necessary investment in the longterm growth and earnings potential of the company and help the company to capitalize on opportunities in the current marketplace for community banks such as enterprise however lower than expected returns on these investments such as slower than anticipated loan and deposit growth in new branches andor lower than expected fee or other income generated from new technology or

consequences which could have a severe negative impact on the companys financial condition capital position liquidity and performance in addition the loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial
