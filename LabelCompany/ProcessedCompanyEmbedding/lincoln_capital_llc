partnersclient log incontact because stocks represent partial ownership of a company we treat our purchases as if we were buying the entire companywe want to have a high degree of confidence the company will be in business  to  years from now do they have a balance sheet that can survive difficult periods in the economy do they have a sustainable competitive advantage are they susceptible to changes in technologyafter we are comfortable with the quality of a company we are considering we then want to know how the current price of its stock compares to the value we would place on it can the stock be purchased at a discount from our perceived value of the company stocks we believe that fixed income investments such as cds treasury bonds and taxfree municipal bonds are intended to be the safe stable and dependable parts of your portfoliowhile many in our business are often tempted to “reach for yield” by investing in lower rated bonds or complex financial instruments we place a high value on quality and simplicity obtaining a high interest rate is always welcome but not at the risk of losing principal fixed income investments our approach lincoln capital’s reputation as a
