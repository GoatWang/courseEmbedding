the life of the mind since the gutenberg press individuals with no establishment connections or entrée can connect with millions worldwide relying solely on the power of their ideas and their prose to getand influencean audience that print journalists and authors could only dream of communities of interest unlimited by time and space are springing into existence now they are even exerting force on the traditional levers of power hall gives a trenchant often humorous analysis of this revolution in the human zeitgeist ranging from politics to media to the arts heres some of the fascinating terrain he covers in his analysis of how blogging is reshaping the world of ideas affecting global public opinion and mass media  this new form of horizontal communication is examined and compared to its feeble predecessors  blogging runs smackdab into the rear guard and both sides end up blinking  the remunerated wordsmiths test the new blogging waters for unmined gold  businesses from the drucker era bow down to the great god gates  the next generation of leaders master the tools they will use  the dank world of geekery meets the highwattage expectations of aesthetics  the blogosphere autoassemblesand becomes a powerful force for change finally hall assembles a list of axioms of blogosophy principles for the first true citizens of the world this survey of the world of blogs is only a sampling of the wonderful surprising and occasionally repulsive experiences that await the undaunted armchair explorer of the blogosphere r scott hall produktdetails

fourteenth century to the late eighteenth century they lived in the vicinity of smeeth brabourne and chilham were lineal descendants and representatives of the ancient but now in name extinct norman family of balliol and through them of the kings of scotland of malcolms line  chilham castle these scotts who claim direct lineal descent from william de balliol le scot lived mostly in scots hall in smeeth they served their king and country over many centuries with loyalty and distinction and contributed in large amount to the kings and nobles of the time and in many cases achieved high office although surprisingly none were ever enobled  scots hall the scots hall scrolls  which consist of beautifully illustrated vellums and scrolls complete with coats of arms impaled with the arms of the families of their various spouses are a measure of the pride of this illustrious family they certainly were able to marry well their many connections to the royal families of the time and wealthy landowners in that part of england are well recorded in the scrolls and jr scotts memorials   and are graphically displayed in the coats of arms in these documents according to j r scott there was a time when one could ride from scots hall to london without leaving scott property some statement  the following extract from the scotts of scots hall gives some idea of the achievements and services to the state by members of this family during the kentish era and many of them are immortalised in the magnificent memorials altar and stained glass windows of brabourne church  sir john scotte sir william scottof brabourne lord chief justice and knight marshall of england in the reigns of edward ii and edward iii buried in brabourne  sir william scotof scots hall knight of the shire of kent and

the shire and a member of the committee of safety for the county of kent during the troubles of king and parliament  as well as others of distinguished note who witnessed the decay of their family and fortune in more recent but less troubled times and thus apparently paid the penalty suggested in the ancient kentish proverb that  scots hall shall have a fallostenhangre was built in angre pride somerfield will have to yielde and mersham hatch shall win the match all were large estates in kent at that time scots hall eventually fell into decay along with the decaying family fortunes and was demolished in   the church of st mary the virgin brabourne one of the owners of scots hall in the days when it rivaled the most splendid houses in kent in elizabethan times was sir thomas scott lawyer superintendent of the improvement of dover harbour and commissioner of the draining of romney marsh and improving the breeds of horses in england he seemed quite an affable fellow judging by the poem probably written by his famous cousin reginald and depicted in the sir thomas page  sir thomas had four wives and seventeen children in the same period thomas scotts cousin reginald scot whose discoverie of witchcraft is a famous book which gives an eyeopening exposure of the beliefs and superstitions of that time he with an insight far in advance of his age sought to stay the hideous persecution which especially in rural districts made any lonely aged person and many others liable to a charge of witchcraft with but the rarest opportunity of escape from consequent barbarities it is said that this book was used as a reference by shakespeare  at that time it was a common belief that  they sacrifice their owne children to the divell before baptisme holding them up in the aire unto him and then thrust a needle into their braines   they use incestuous adulterie with spirits    they eate the flesh and drinke the bloud of men and children openlie    they kill mens cattel    they bewitch mens corne    they ride and flie in the aire bring stormes make tempests    they use venerie with a divell called incubus and have children by them which become the best witches  many of this reginalds contemporaries hailed his reasonable exposure of unreasonable superstition with joy for as one of them put it he dismasketh sundry egregious impostures and in certaine principall chapters and speciall passages hitteth the nayle on the head with a witnesse james the vi of scotland described the work as damnable and on becoming james i of england the same bigoted and pedantical monarch ordered all copies of the discoverie to be burnt  in spite of this there seems little doubt that this book was largely instrumental in changing the thinking which eventually ended wichcraft in england and scotland happily it has been reprinted several times since and is available on the internet in paperback from wwwamazoncom the same reginald sometimes spelled reynold published his first book a perfect platforme of a hoppegarden in  which led to the establishment of hopharvesting in kent to this day hops are still one of kents major agricultural products  the line of descent from the scots

corresponding slides will be available for at least  days in the investor relations section of our website in addition we will furnish a copy of our prepared remarks on form k later this morning ill now turn the call over to scott scott hall thanks martie and good morning thanks for joining us today as we discussed our results for the  second quarter on the last call id only been at mueller for about a week it has been a busy period since then i have enjoyed meeting many of you at conferences in meetings and by phone it is also been an important time to meet the many talented people across mueller i’ll begin our discussion this morning of the quarter with a brief overview followed by evan’s more detailed financial report i’ll then provide additional color on the quarter results and developments in our end markets as well as our outlook for the  third quarter and full year overall consolidated second quarter net sales increased slightly due to strong growth at mueller technologies we were pleased to see that the mueller technologies’ team grew net sales  in the quarter however net sales performance at mueller company was disappointing as net sales declined  this quarter yearoveryear this net sales decline was largely the result of lower international sales as sales outside of north america were down about  million taking a closer look at our domestic water sales at mueller company we also note that the adverse weather conditions in the western united states impacted sales in the quarter as well western region water sales were down about  however all other domestic water sales were up about  despite slightly lower net sales at mueller company adjusted operating margins improved  basis points to  the th consecutive quarter of margin expansion the improvements in both adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating income from continuing operations were due to productivity improvement the team at mueller technologies again delivered improved adjusted operating performance this quarter this improvement was  million versus prior year largely the result of the net sales growth we recently became aware that in certain environments some of our radios produced between  and  were feeling prematurely during the quarter we took a discrete  million charge to meet current and future warranty obligations associated with these products evan will speak more detail about the accounting and handling of the charge i will speak a little bit about the steps we took to ensure this isn’t repeated in the future in particular we have approved the manufacturing process so this particular failure mode wont repeat itself and we instituted accelerated lifecycle testing on all of our radios i believe we have correctly scoped and address this problem and implemented the corrective steps to ensure that our products meet industry and mueller standards for reliability as a reminder we completed a number of strategic initiatives in the second quarter we acquired singer valve in february which added automatic control valves to our product portfolio we initiated the repurchase of  million of shares under the accelerated share repurchase program we increased our quarterly dividend  to  per share we amended our term loan which lowers our interest rates spread and we completed the divestiture of anvil in early january we believe these initiatives demonstrate our ongoing commitment to create longterm value for shareholders we will discuss our outlook in more detail later but we continue to expect yearoveryear growth in  from demand for our products in our address to water markets we believe that mueller water products remains wellpositioned to deliver longterm value for shareholders and with that i’ll turn the call over to evan evan hart thanks scott and good morning everyone i’ll first review our second quarter consolidated financial results and then discuss segment performance as a reminder i will only be discussing our results from continuing operations mueller technologies drove the  increase in consolidated net sales in the  second quarter consolidated net sales increased  million to  million as compared with  million for the  second quarter adjusted gross profit improved both mueller company and mueller technologies and was  million for the  second quarter compared with  million last year adjusted gross margin increased  basis points to  in  second quarter from  in the  second quarter selling general and administrative expenses were  million in the  second quarter compared with  million last year the  million increase was due primary to personnel related expenses including our planned increase investment in product development ga expenses as a percent of net sales were  slightly higher compared with  of net sales in the prior year both mueller company and mueller technologies contributed to the  million increase in adjusted operating income from continuing operations for the  second quarter which was  million as compared with  million for the  second quarter adjusted ebitda for the  second quarter increased to  million compared with  million for the  second quarter for the trailing  months adjusted ebitda was  million or  of net sales we amended our term loan credit agreement on february   through this amendment we reduce the applicable interest rate spread by  basis points interest expense net for the  second quarter decreased to  million as compared with  million for the  second quarter for the  second quarter income tax expense of  was  of income before income taxes we recognize net discrete tax benefits of  million in the quarter primarily excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation we grew adjusted earnings per diluted share yearoveryear to  from  i’ll now move on to segment performance beginning with mueller company net sales for the  second quarter decreased  to  million as compared with  million for the  second quarter mueller company increased adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin in the second quarter due to productivity improvements adjusted operating income for the  second quarter grew  to  million as compared with just  million for the  second quarter and adjusted operating margin grew  basis points despite slightly lower net sales adjusted ebitda for the  second quarter increased to  million compared with  million for the  second quarter and adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter increased  basis points to  from  last year and now mueller technologies net sales in the  second quarter increased  to  million as compared with  million for the  second quarter as scott mentioned we recently became aware that in certain environments some radio products produced between  and  were failing at a higher than expected rate consequently we refined our estimates and increase the warranty reserve weve taken a discrete warranty charge of  million in the quarter to meet current and future obligations of which  million is now reserved for future obligations turning to discussion of mueller water products liquidity free cash flow which is cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations less capital expenditures with negative  million for the  second quarter compared with negative  million for the  second quarter at march   total debt was comprised of a  million senior secured term loan due november  and  million of other the term loan accrues interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus a spread of  basis points at march  net debt leverage was  times in our excess availability under the abl credit agreement was about  million i’ll now turn the call back to scott scott hall thanks evan as we analyzed mueller technologies’ second quarter the overall  net sales growth was primarily driven by a  increase in ami shipments at mueller systems this was the sixth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear doubledigit growth in our ami product line at the end of the second quarter mueller systems ami backlog was up about  from the prior year and echologics added  million of projects under contract mueller technologies adjusted operating loss of  million for the second quarter was an improvement of  million from the prior year due to higher shipment volumes this is the fourth consecutive quarter where mueller technologies has improved its adjusted operating performance yearoveryear turning to mueller company we again delivered solid adjusted operating performance in the quarter with the th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion productivity improvements exceeded the  basis point increase in adjusted operating margin compared to last year offset by higher raw material costs and price looking at our latest  months mueller companys adjusted ebitda margin was  or a  basis point improvement from the prior trailing  month period looking ahead to the third quarter and staying with mueller company this year bookings in advance of the effective date of the price increase were lower yearoveryear and shipments were comparable between the quarters we believe that overall distributor inventory levels at the end of the second quarter were about flat yearoveryear therefore we have entered the third visibility than we typically have at this time of year while we remain cautiously optimistic about end market demand growth from residential construction and municipal markets uncertainty from less for demand visibility remains for this business mueller technologies had a strong first half of the year with nearly  sales growth we expect that growth rate to moderate in the second half of the year largely due to yearoveryear comparisons you’ll remember that last year our third and fourth quarters were our strongest quarters for mueller technologies secondhalf growth is expected to come from increased shipment volumes of ami system and growth of fixed leak detection projects for example we announced yesterday that san jose water company has selected echologics leak detection technology this project will be the largest deployment of echologics fixed leak detection technology todate with more than  notes deployed throughout san joses service area and we expect that bookings in the third quarter for distribution fixed leak detection products will exceed all bookings for these products todate looking at the third quarter on a consolidated basis with the tougher comp in ami products and the lower prebuying advance of the effective date of the price increase of mueller company we believe third quarter consolidated net sales percentage growth will be in the low to mid singledigit from an operating perspective the combination of continued productivity improvements offset by the rising raw material costs environment and the dilution from the singer acquisition our expected results in adjusted operating margins for the third quarter comparable with previous year q margins we believe that the demand environment for our municipal and residential end markets remained strong over the longterm but for the full year  we expect consolidated net sales percentage growth to be in the low to mid singledigits much of that is expected to be in the third quarter evan will wrap up now with some other items evan evan hart based on our current expectations for the full year corporate expenses will be  million to  million depreciation and amortization will be  million to  million and interest expense will be  million to  million we expect our adjusted effective income tax rate to be  to  clearly higher in the second half of the year and capital expenditures to be between  million and  million finally we expect  free cash flow to be driven by improved operating results and an improvement in working capital our target is for free cash flow to exceed adjusted income from continuing operations operator would you please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now start question and answer session of today’s conference operator instructions our first question comes from the line of mike your line is open mike wood your line is open scott hall i’m not hearing anything operator if mike is asking the question operator okay let’s move on to the second question it’s coming from the line of seth weber your line is open seth weber hey good morning everybody scott hall good morning seth weber i guess first just a clarification scott are you looking for organic revenue growth for mueller co here in the third quarter of everyoveryear excluding the singer acquisition scott hall yes very slight i think it’s where i would put itself i mean there is going to be some organic growth i think there were some pentup demand as we referenced from the west where we have that slowdown and bookings will grow there so to answer the question directly yes we expect the small amount of organic growth from mueller co in q seth weber okay and i guess kind of taking that to the next level bigger picture i mean this is going to be your fourth quarter on a row with kind of plus or minus zero growth in the mueller co business i mean what do you really think is going on there and what you think is the real kind of sustainable top line growth level for that business i am trying to reconcile you have been pushing through price increases pretty consistently but it’s not showing up on the revenue line so i am trying to understand what they kind of inherent volume growth for that business where it is scott hall i think the inherent volume growth should be around something like  basis points or better greater than gdp i mean that’s kind of how i think about the business many years of neglect in the water infrastructure so as for a longterm growth that exceeds normal growth for lack of better words i referenced it my comments one of the things i want to make sure we do as we talk about these things as speak plainly so that there is no questions price we have gotten in the past we have not got it in q in fact price was about  million unfavorable in the quarter so we had good price for a long time certainly while the raw material was dropping we were able to get a little bit of price and the spread would open that certainly reversed itself in q i suspect that’s a lag they don’t see i expect we’ll start get support for price now as we start to see the increase in raw material cost but we will have to wait and see but i think the answer to question directly that we should see better than gdp growth in water spending for some time i think inherently there has to be seth weber okay that’s helpful and i guess my follow up question how are you thinking – obviously you’ve already been there for short time but if you change your thoughts around capital allocation you do have the accelerated share program that you announced previously but are you thinking anymore are you closer to any ma or you are thinking about boosting share buyback at all or maybe just you kind of updated thoughts on capital allocation scott hall so let me reiterated that we are on path with when i laid out in our last quarter call where we were examining our strategic options as far as we are to take the business outside of just pure play water infrastructure as we look at this swim lane but i think i described in detail in the past we have all of that still that work ongoing we have our board meeting in july still speed up to have that work presented and then something to communicate to you in the after that kind of in the first quarter of next year kind of timeframe when we lay out what our strategic direction is going to be we are filling our ma pipeline we continue to look at many options but i think that we are not going to have a kneejerk reaction here the bulldogs certainly will continue with what if there is going to be a new leg of the stool so to speak it’s not going to come because somebody put an offering memorandum out or something like that seth weber very helpful thanks a lot guys scott hall thank you seth operator our next question comes from the line of mr brian lee your line is open brian lee hi guys thanks for taking the questions just to follow up on the guidance point on the low to midsingledigit guide for the year it’s some change from the midsingledigit number from your prior outlook is that all from mueller co or can you maybe provide some context on the midsingledigit in  growth targets you had laid out from mueller co and technologies on the last call scott hall yes thanks for the question to clarify i think overall we are moderating our view to how much growth we will get in the mueller co business in  i have been here a quarter now and i have seen the bookings and the trends that i think that there is really mixed kind of messages from the market as far as where the growth is going to come and how sustainable that is in the new term i do believe the team has had a difficult environment i can’t point to a single municipality that said “oh i am not going to do what i said i was going to do but i do think that the pentup demand has been muted by people waiting for this infrastructure spending and so i think that uncertainty doesn’t look like it’s going to be fixed anytime soon so i think it’s proven to kind of – so i think that number is going to be in the three or lower kind of range for mueller co but the ami trends remain strong so i think that our success rate with ami and where our growth is coming from i still expect that business to deliver  and i expect that business to give us better conversion on the growth life frankly i expect it to give us better conversion on the growth than they gave us in q we’ve got some work to do there and we are working on it brian lee okay thanks that’s super helpful maybe scott just staying on mueller co for a second year you mentioned the weakness in the international segway can you remind us how much international exposure you have there i am assuming it’s mostly north of the border here and then how much of that is playing into your sort of slightly downgraded view of mueller co outlook was that the biggest surprise outside of maybe the california whether on the quarter scott hall yes so to be clear i said outside north america canada remains okay not great but okay really it’s maybe latin american problem in the quarter and part of it is complex it’s about  of the business but i think the outlook for it could be difficult in q at the end as well so i think middle east mostly though i think is where we are experiencing the softness and i don’t know the outlook right now we’ve got a couple of things in hopper that could get them back to kind of breakeven but right now our forecast is breakeven for that non north american piece of the market but through summer script brian lee okay great last one from me i will pass it on – just on the – you had eluded to the rising raw material cost and the guidance here for fiscal q as for operating margins to be relatively flat yearonyear how should we think about the trend in and margins here in that context of may be a tougher yearonyear environment from the raw materials cost perspective just curious to hear your take on what we should be thinking there thanks scott hall okay no problem thanks for the question because i kind of want to spend a little time on this so in my prepared comments i said we had about  basis points improvement in mueller company and if you really dig into where the productivity came from there was some material usage productivity there were some machine utilization productivity and then there were some – mostly some insourcing absorption productivity that were really strong in the quarter that i want to make sure everybody realizes and if you think about the difficulty they had from the volume point of view then you go ahead and layer in the ballpark  million of inflationary pressures they felt in their raw material buying and  million or so of price pressure we felt yearoveryear price declines manufacturing team basically delivered the  basis points plus  million and incumbent such their spending so that there is a little of lower volume also didn’t hurt margin so i am very pleased with the situation and awareness and the execution at mueller company around that with that said i have no reason to expect they can’t deliver similar performance in q from an execution point of view but i have cautioned you to when you think upon the margin in q the reason i am calling it flat is because i haven’t said we are going to get that price back and i haven’t said we are not going to be able to feel those same inflationary pressures if we are able to move the price in the market as we are certainly trying to recover those increase raw material costs then i think we could have some margin expansion but i was very clan in the discussion that that’s not in what’s right now because i haven’t got a long history of being successful and say oh i am going to raise price and put it on the talk there’s always some dynamics there that we forget or it’s difficult in the industrial market so i have got it flat but yes price in sustentation of the inflationary pressures would be upside in the quarter brian lee okay thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from mr michael gaugler your line is open michael gaugler good morning everyone scott hall good morning michael gaugler scott on the last call you mentioned you were anxious to get out on the road and visit the plants perhaps you could provide us with some color on what you found particularly in the area of opportunities to improve margins scott hall i think – well thanks michael i think the tour has been first of all fantastic and i think the team that i have been happy to hear is they’re very talented than and i think our employees are really motivated with that said i think that as you think about selfdirected workforce you think about solid manufacturing you think about single piece flow there was opportunity at all the plants i have been to to improve somehow quite large opportunity set and others are near worldclass i would really like to applause the team in alabama it’s the best probably i have ever been in and great visual system exactly where they are your production schedule every day every way where they are and your assembly schedule the flow on the plant is all things that you can see what operation is going to happen next in impressive facility on the other end things are some that i think other investment in certain places so i think between summer machine jobs and some other foundries there was opportunity as it relates in the brass business and in the gauge valve for margin expansion both through combination of investments and relaying out some of the plants and thinking more about flow now the thing i normally would do here is try and quantify it for you and give you  basis points here or  basis points there i think there is enough of an opportunity set that we conceptually at a high level should be thinking about margin expansion of somewhere around  to  basis points a year and then i think we’re under invested in our engineering resources as it relates to new product development and some piece of that being reinvested back into the engineering and product development piece of the business michael gaugler okay that’s good color then as a followup regarding the san jose water announcement should we expect to see other announcements like that from large wellknown water utilities in the near future scott hall we have a couple of things in the hopper that we know that we’re optimistic of so yes and as i said in my comments we expect the distribution leak detection product that ds product actually in q take more orders in for each of the next foreseeable quarters then all previous years’ sales so it’s finally catching on i think the success we’ve seen in the trials we’ve run the leak locates have the efficacy of this product is starting to catch on we really think we may have we are hoping with top lighting and above here but it’s too soon to call it but early indications are really exciting michael gaugler all right that’s all i had thank you scott hall thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jose your line is open unidentified analyst good morning guys evan hart good morning scott hall good morning jose unidentified analyst hey scott you gave some good color on mueller tech business i’m just wondering if your expectations are still for kind of the profitability improvement in that business over the course of the year that maybe you guys had at the beginning of the year scott hall so i realized when i am talking on this there are employees listening too my expectation is just we can made it to  million of operating improvement when we developed our plant and if we are going to have a culture of execution we do what we say we are going to do with that said i think i will look at the conversion we’ve got in the quarter we increased sales  million and we’re only doing  million of operating improvement that i would have expected there to be in the  to  range kind of number so i realize we have some risk and there’s probably on that  million of yearoveryear improvements there is risk but if you are going to have a culture of execution then you find ways to develop your countermeasures you take other actions that meet your commitment levels and so we have to review those plans for technologies and it can’t just be always sell your way out of trouble sometimes you have to look at the cost structures you have to look at your inputs and so to answer the question directly i still expected but i recognized have seen q performance that there is a little bit of risk unidentified analyst okay that’s very helpful and maybe evan you can help on this one what’s kind of the expectation for the warranty expense kind of going forward and it kind of cadence to that you got evan hart well jose with this particular issue as we mentioned we did record about  million in the quarter and we were left with about  million warranty reserve for this particular item and i will note that back in q we saw about  of expense for this particular problem and that really was the catalyst for us to take a more detailed look do a indepth study and we’d find our estimates to come up with the particular charge in the second quarter we think that the charge is adequate and sufficient to cover these issues with the radius produce between  and  i think going forward we will just have a normal warranty charge provision that we’ve always had and so there is nothing expected from a large magnitude like this in the future unidentified analyst okay scott hall and i would like to go and say that we did the advance lifecycle testing jose on the things made after  we have been running those environmental tests and the failure rate has been better than industry averages by a lot like  unidentified analyst okay that’s helpful scott hall so i feel like the team – i wasn’t here but whatever the change is when they realize they were having some of these issues and basically for everybody’s benefit it’s when they are underwater in a pit environment in warm climate that’s when they really start to have a problem unidentified analyst okay and just any changes in terms of the raw material that you saw throughout the quarter that you kind of extrapolating into the rest of the year or is it roughly the same across both businesses evan hart i would say this when you take a look at our two largest inputs scrap sale where i think in the second quarter they were up about  and as a reminder that accounts for about  of cost of goods sold related mueller company and that was roughly around  million impact in the quarter for us i think as we go forward i think the data to forecast that are calling for mid to say  increase in those raw material input so i wouldn’t say anything a significant at this point on the rising but i think it will be faced with a little higher input cost in the third quarter as well unidentified analyst okay very helpful thanks guys scott hall thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ryan your line is open ryan connors thank you yes ryan connors with boenning  scattergood i wanted to just kind of drill down on this pricing issue a little bit scott and i am little surprised about the pricing i want to understand some of the dynamics behind that you mentioned in your comment earlier that there always these dynamics that crop up the impact price but my understanding of mueller co has always been that even though it might not have the sex appeal of mueller tech it’s oligopoly market that even maybe duopoly with some of the products and issues and pricing has always been very rationale so in this kind of environment where we’ve got raw material price cost up and the demand environment is at least okay if not phenomenal or at least certainly serviceable i mean what are those dynamics that are preventing you from getting price is it some kind of bad actor in the market that’s suddenly acting a irrationally or is it some channel issues i mean anything you can give us in terms of why that’s happening scott hall yes i can give you my theory and i’m happy to do that but it is just that i mean here’s what’s happened i think that last year we announced the price increase just as did this year and in anticipation that price increase distribution took a whole lot of orders in a prebuy certainly million  million more than you would anticipate a normal february being they bought that they prebought in q and then raw materials ran away they ran down and so competitive forces being what they were in the first quarter basically our first fiscal quarter basically the prebuy that did in our q for their shipments in q didn’t actually result in higher gross margins for them why does the distributor prebuy they prebuy for their gross margins they belong they get the benefit of the lower cost but they get to sell into the higher price market raw materials ran down and pricing was basically flat price to price was flat so this year you come along and everybody announces a price increase distribution doesn’t prebuy and so now inventories are getting heavy in the distributor lanes and so they now come out with their buys and people being hungry and not having the visibility all of a sudden now might be willing to discount the level is there are a bad actor in the market yes there’s a bad actor in the market might be in somebody’s not got the discipline to keep where there need to be and i’ll say it’s not so much around hydrants as it is around valves and brass so when you look at where the price came out that’s part of it the other thing i want to make sure everybody understands is when you think about our products think about the deeper they go in the ground the more valuable they are so a fire hydrants with a foot stuff for canada sales for more money than our fire hydrants been has a white barrel and basically it just got the l going under the surface of the ground and if you think about what we lost at west as an average weighted average price on a fire hydrants but you think about what we loss at west as a result to the rain that also play kind of almost like a regional mix impact on our price so i think those were the two big drivers of why we’ve had the difficult price environment in q than we traditionally have ryan ryan connors got it well that’s maybe only theory but that’s very helpful one now my second question is actually related in that bigger picture but as you look at capital deployment there been a number of companies some of them in the metering side some of them for were in the pump side and elsewhere that has started to kind forward integrate into their channel and distribution started to go into more of a corporate channel as opposed to the traditional thirdparty channel so obviously you’re going to tip your hand in terms of whether that something that’s being tactically contemplated but whats your view of that as a concept is that something that at any point you think would make sense or do you feel that the traditional channel is the way to go scott hall i think the whole channel question is a fascinating discussion and i think this intermediation and more direct sales as you see more municipalities try to entering the mwbe space and disable that trend and i think there a just a ton of dynamics going on in the channel right now you see potentially the hb supply could be after waterworks for sale could go pe go strategic buyer so there’s a lot of moving pieces there that said i am not sure on our core competency is ever going to be round putting together the portfolio if you need to be a successful distributor i had distribution business previously in my career and i can tell you to make them successful and add value to people that use them generally a lot of what you have to be good at manufacturing are not necessarily things youre going to be good at to be distributor and therefore while it remains the possibility it’s something that i would give a very very low probabilities it’s a top class and the other thing i would say is when you’re number one in well established channel very very difficult to go into competition with your customers and so it’s always a play of the distinct player to try to take that role to disrupt the distribution channels because theyre really not getting their fair share of the distribution channel so probably not something that we see mueller do ryan connors got it well it’s very excited and thanks for your time scott hall thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jim you line is open jim jim giannakouros hi jim giannakouros from oppenheimer thanks for taking my questions i understand you’re pleased with acquisition and plans appreciate that you’re doing good things in there’s is there investment and plan that we should be cognizant of when thinking about incremental margin progression as capacity utilization clears  and heads up from here scott hall well i don’t think there’s anything massive so i think that we’re not contemplating jim a big new foundry at this point i think that theres enough available capacity i think there’s enough finetuning i think there’s enough square footage and other things that we – if we needed a well furnish at some point we could buy both so i don’t think there’s any massive depression load coming in the next two or three years with that said i think that there is a modernization that needs to happen indicator there is modernization it needs to happen in indiscernible so that there’s some modernization that needs to happen cleveland north carolina so i think that there will perhaps as i said in the last call  million  million  million kind of incremental capex for some period of time as we fixed the machine tool utilization part of the business and improve our assembly capabilities those kinds of things but not anything major jim giannakouros got it okay and apologize i did hop on a little late here quite a few comments on the muni side of course a head of clarity on stimulus et cetera that youre seeing any comments on how residential i guess either housing starts or more specifically new community development is tracking versus your expectation curious to the outlook view through your lens our checks and read certainly suggest strength but your results certainly dont stack up thanks scott hall yes i think that’s one of the things we’re trying to connect the dots on we feel good about what we’ve seen in housing starts and land development i think singlefamily units were strong in january and february and i think we were tracking pretty at january and february we’ve singlefamily dwelling and then march was a bit of cliff that fell off i think part of that was weatherrelated as i think when you look at the housing starts date i think march actually on an annualized basis seasonally adjustments was down from the january february try to muting what is good fundamentals going forward for strengthen in land development if you think about brass it’s predominantly residential and thats an area that weve got to start getting some growth from here in q that we’re going to be our and your expectations jim giannakouros okay thanks and a clarification point i think it was one that asked on pricing i surprised as well you did say that there is “bad actor” but wheres the pressure coming from are you feeling the pressure is from distributors that may have inflated inventories or can you just provide a little more color there because i kind of miss point on where exactly the pressure is coming from scott hall okay so let me try and give you some clarity if you look at the average price that i sold a distributor in q versus the average price i sold a distributor the exact same product q year ago that is down ever so slightly like less than  if you look at how much indiscernible valve is going forward that’s getting buried in las vegas versus one that’s getting very in north florida you will see that same valve has a different price and i’m making those up and now we should take away and say the actually regional pricing difference is such that losing a lot of the west volume as a weighted average cost us about  million and then about  kind of comes from the mix of different deals between customers so you might get a rebate or you might take the answer you might get that and somebody else doesn’t free terms and things like that are also part of our price so it’s a complex subject and i want to give too much away on in terms of the competitive dynamic but at the same time its something that i can tell you we have our rung around and we’re watching very very carefully there should have been better support regardless of fall sides of the price increase in valves and hydrants there’s been another increase for brass that’s recently been announced and we haven’t baked any of it in to our forecast because we got to wait and see how everybody behaves and hope we’ll be watching it carefully so to summarize part of it is the regional difference in pricing part of it is the mix of large distributors versus small distributors and then part of it is just some small amount of yearoveryear price degradation jim giannakouros thank you that’s helpful operator thank you our next question comes from the line joe joe you’re line is open unidentified analyst hey guys this is actually indiscernible from joseph giordano at a cowen today thanks for taking the question i believe that singer valve has a much more global – is much more global than other businesses that you have have you already identified some opportunities where you might be able to like go back to these global customers and introduce your full range of products scott hall yes that part of integration is what we think about the synergies we are looking where they can take us and their channels are established and we are looking where we can actually grow their presence in our existing channel and so whether we do some mueller branded private control valves or singer’s channel can actually take key valves and butterfly valves and the white into their market certainly those are the things that we’re working on and that we’ve identified what i think to be fair to the development team out there i think the channel development work is more than in immediate quarter kind of time line so when we think about where that growth is going to come from we think about those developing infrastructures around the world we think that the sale cycle on those is measured in quarters not in days unidentified analyst okay thanks and then i think one of your competitor has mentioned that they have remote disconnect capabilities which i think you were probably one of the few companies to open now could you remind us some the spec that separates you from your competition thank you scott hall yes i think that’s a biggest difference is a for everybody benefit we are partnering with our radio technology and b our actuation technology is such that we’re not going to denigrate anybody’s but we’re confident that we have more than  advantage in battery life usage when you actually have to use the rdm ours is the most efficient from a not having to back out and replace the battery and get – i don’t want to be incorrect there so somebody clean me up if i’m wrong but i think twice as many actuations where you can actually turn off and turn back on the meter without actually having to service the battery so very few are tough roles if you use our solution than anybody else’s and basically it’s because we partnered the valve and the actuation methodology that is the most power efficient operator our next question comes from the line of indiscernible your line is open unidentified analyst good morning scott hall so last quarter ami backlog was up  from the last year this quarter around  so what’s the average time expect to turn that backlog into revenue scott hall great question that i’m not trying to doc here but i am trying to get some clarity on for ourselves i think the behavior here is that you get your award and contract from your municipality or from your puc and you get a target date when theyre going to start their install and then you get another target data when theyre going to start their install and then as you get closer you get refinements so all stuff that’s been awarded and contracted is on book what is really really difficult to estimate the time and until we get within the  day window when they’re actually going to use the resources to put across in the field to start the changes and the part that’s really i think we’ve got a fair deal of clarity around is the part where its new construction new homes are going up and they are being sold that’s got some clarity around it it’s the swap programs that the estimates are very wildly on in so i know its a very satisfying answer but the answer is we miss on the contracted pieces by  or  days quite often unidentified analyst that helps and then looking at i guess acquisition scenarios for the mueller technologies segment is there an area that you would consider to complement what you have and also for mueller co can you find adjacent business operating at the market profile you do in that business scott hall i think the margin is difficult i understand the margin dilution discussion but very much we have to create opportunities if we can make investments that exceed our weighted average cost of capital and then we’re creating value and sometimes the margins – ebitda margins would be dilutive and sometimes hopefully there’ll be accretive but this is a very very good business we have with mueller company from an ebitda margin point of view but i also think that there are adjacencies out there that we can absolutely get into lever and be successful as per mueller technologies im less inclined right now to do acquisitions i think theres a lot of operational heavy lifting to do in front of that business i think i said it earlier also i think that conversion had been strong on the  million of volume and you’d say okay they are executing and every things running exactly the way you want it to run and then you would consider that they have the capacity for integration but i dont think where they are right now and so i would expect to see a little more execution if you will in systems business i think in the echologics business it’s a different challenge i think that their order book has swollen i think the challenge of the san jose water thing we have to be mindful if there could be pieces there that we would need to bolton to increase their capabilities increase their assembly capacity and that i would certainly do because i think the future is bright there and i think we have enough operational excellence in mueller co and in other parts of the business that we can make sure that business grows with full potential by levering what’s internal so more volume to do adjacencies willing to bolton indiscernible and echologics want to see some execution on technologies first – i’m sorry systems first operator thank you i show no question at the moment scott hall well let me thanks everybody and that will wrap this up for today and martie if you have anything you want to say to wrap up we’ll go from there martie zakas nothing thank you all very much operator and that concludes todays conference thank you for participating you may now disconnect copyright policy all
