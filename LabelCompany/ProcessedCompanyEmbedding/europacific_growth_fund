target date ‘lifecycle’ or target risk ‘lifestyle’ options should not be considered a balanced investment program in particular allocating assets to a small number of options concentrated in particular business or market sectors will subject your account to increased risk and volatility examples of business or market sectors where this risk may be particularly high include a technologyrelated businesses including internetrelated businesses b smallcap securities and c foreign securities john hancock does not provide advice regarding appropriate investment allocations turnover risk active and frequent trading of fund securities results in a high fund turnover rate funds with high turnover rates often have higher transaction costs which are paid by the fund that may have an adverse impact on fund performance and may generate shortterm capital gains on which taxes may be imposedsector risk when a funds investments are concentrated in a particular industry or sector of the economy eg real estate technology financial services they are not as diversified as the investments of most mutual funds and are far less diversified than the broad securities markets funds concentrating in a particular industry sector tend to be more volatile than other mutual funds and the values of their investments tend to go up and down more rapidly a fund that invests in a particular industry or sector is particularly susceptible to the impact of market economic regulatory and other factors affecting that industry or sectorgrowth stock risk because growth securities typically make lower dividend payments or do not make dividend payments at all investment returns are based on capital appreciation making returns dependent on market increases and decreases the market prices of growth stocks are highly sensitive to future earnings expectations growth stocks may therefore be more volatile than nongrowth stocksfixedincome securities risk fixedincome securities or bonds are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk the credit rating of bonds in the fund could be downgraded or the issuer of a bond could default on its obligations in general lowerrated fixedincome securities involve more credit risk when interest rates rise bond prices generally fallcurrency risk funds that invest directly in foreign currencies and in securities that trade in or receive revenues in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the currency being hedgedrisk of increase in expenses your actual costs of investing in the fund may be higher than the expenses shown in annual fund operating expenses for a variety of reasons for example expense ratios may be higher than those shown if a fee limitation is changed or terminated or if average net assets decrease net assets are more likely to decrease and fund expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatilehigh yield securities risk fixedincome securities that are not investment grade are commonly referred to as high yield securities or junk bonds these securities offer a potentially higher yield than other higher rated securities but they carry a greater degree of risk and are considered speculative by the major credit rating agenciesforeign securities risk foreign securities involve special risks including potentially unfavorable currency exchange rates limited government regulation including less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards and exposure to possible economic political and social instability to the extent the fund invests in emerging market countries its foreign securities risk will be highersmall cap stock risk the fund’s investments in smaller companies are subject to more erratic price movements than investments in larger more established companies small cap companies may be developing or marketing new products or services for which markets are not yet and may never become established although small unseasoned companies may offer greater opportunities for capital growth than larger more established companies they also involve greater risks and should be considered speculativemarket risk the value of a fund’s securities may go down in response to overall stock or bond market movements markets tend to move in cycles with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices stocks tend to go up and down in value more than bonds if the fund’s investments are concentrated in certain sectors its performance could be worse than the overall marketcredit and counterparty risk a fund is subject to the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a fixedincome security or other obligation the counterparty to a derivatives contract or repurchase agreement or the borrower of a fund’s securities will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal interest or settlement payments or to otherwise honor its obligationsequity securities risk stock markets are volatile and the price of equity securities such as common and preferred stocks and their equivalents will fluctuate the value of equity securities purchased by the fund could decline if the financial condition of the companies in which the fund invests decline or if overall market and economic conditions deteriorateemerging markets risk the prices of securities issued by foreign companies and governments located in developingemerging markets countries may be affected more negatively by inflation devaluation of their currencies higher transaction costs delays in settlement adverse political developments the introduction of capital controls withholding taxes nationalization of private assets expropriation social unrest war or lack of timely information than those in developed countriesinterest rate risk fixedincome securities are affected by changes in interest rates when interest rates decline the market value of fixedincome securities generally will increase conversely when interest rates rise the market value of fixedincome securities will generally decrease the longer the remaining maturity of instruments held by the fund the more sensitive the fund is to interest rate riskus government securities risk us government securities do not involve the degree of credit risk associated with investments in lower quality fixedincome securities as a result the yields available from us government securities are generally lower than the yields available from many other fixedincome securities these securities like other fixedincome securities are subject to interest rate riskmerger and replacement transition risk in the case of fund mergers and replacements the affected funds that are being merged or replaced may implement the redemption of your interest by payment in cash or by distributing assets in kind in either case the redemption of your interest by the affected fund as well as the investment of the redemption proceeds by the new fund may result in transaction costs to the funds because the affected funds may find it necessary to sell securities and the new funds will find it necessary to invest the redemption proceeds also the redemption and reinvestment processes including any transition period that may be involved in completing such mergers and replacements could be subject to market gains or losses including those from currency exchange rates the transaction costs and potential market gains or losses could have an impact on the value of your investment in the affected fund and in the new fund and such market gains or losses could also have an impact on the value of any existing investment that you or other investors may have in the new fund although there can be no assurances that all risks can be eliminated john hancock will use its best efforts to manage and minimize such risks and costs where the redemption of your interest is implemented through a distribution of assets in kind the effective date of the merger or replacement may vary from the target date due to the transition period commencing either before or after the date that is required to liquidate or transition the assets for investment in the new fundinformation risk there is a risk that information used by the adviser to evaluate the social and environmental performance of issuers industries markets sectors and regions may not be readily available complete or accurate which could negatively impact the adviser’s ability to apply its social and environmental standards which may negatively impact fund performance this may also lead the fund to avoid investment in certain issuers industries markets sectors or regionsissuer risk an issuer of a security purchased by a fund may perform poorly and therefore the value of its stocks and bonds may decline poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions competitive pressures breakthroughs in technology reliance on suppliers labor problems or shortages corporate restructurings fraudulent disclosures or other factorsmanager risk the performance of a fund that is actively managed will reflect in part the ability of the manager to make investment decisions that are suited to achieving the fund’s investment objective depending on the managers investment decisions a fund may not reach its investment objective or it could underperform its peers or lose moneyliquidity risk a fund is exposed to liquidity risk when trading volume lack of a market maker or legal restrictions impair the funds ability to sell particular securities or close derivative positions at an advantageous price funds with investment strategies that involve securities of companies with smaller market capitalizations foreign securities derivatives or securities with substantial market andor credit risk tend to have the greatest exposure to liquidity riskinflationprotected securities interest rate risk inflationprotected securities may react differently from other fixed income securities to changes in interest rates because interest rates on inflationprotected securities are adjusted for inflation the values of these securities are not materially affected by inflation expectations therefore the value of inflationprotected securities are anticipated to change in response to changes in real interest rates which represent nominal stated interest rates reduced by the expected impact of inflation generally the value of an inflationprotected security will fall when real interest rates rise and will rise when real interest rates fall important notes
