exchange for three minor league  lefthanded pitchers nick wells   jake brentz  and rob rasmussen  rasmussen will take lowe’s spot on the man roster it’s not a surprising move for seattle lowe has plenty of value to contending teams as an economical setup man out of the bullpen he’s been seattle’s best reliever this season making  appearances and allowing just six runs in  innings pitched

with the opportunity to acquire three players and all three have numbers of years of control and are young kids – that’s a hard call” dustin ackley trade symbolizes continuing dark days for mariners  larry stone lowe who was drafted and developed by the the mariners  signed a minor league deal in the offseason as an insurance policy for what was supposed to be a stacked bullpen however seattle’s shutdown bullpen from last season imploded with key righthanders – danny farquhar dominic leone yoervis medina fernando rodney and tom wilhelmsen – all struggling this season lowe started the season in class aaa tacoma but was called up on may  and was outstanding from the very beginning while lowe goes to another team and will be a free agent in the offseason sources close to lowe said he’d be interesting in returning to seattle next season lowe is building a house in vancouvercamas area and plans to live there in the offseason but lowe won’t sign for a minor league contract like he did this past offseason it will take a “reasonable” major league contract to bring lowe back “losing mark was tough” manager lloyd mcclendon said “he’s been one of the top righthanded relievers in all of baseball this season he’s done a tremendous job for us he was everything that was right about the seattle mariners he represented this organization in the highest fashion he’s a quality individual quality person in the clubhouse and it was tough to lose him” the mariners add some depth to their farm system rasmussen has some big league experience while wells and brentz are still very young
