becomes a star if they fail it will turn into a dog stars   market leader in a highgrowth industry critical to the continued future success of the firm   as industries mature they move into cash cows cash cows   high relative hare of lowgrowth markets because they are the primary generators of profits and cash in a corporation  do not require additional capital markets are stable share leadership usually mean they enjoy economies of scale and relatively high profit margins dogs  low share businesses in lowgrowth markets throw off some cash typically generate low profits or losses    what are the major limitations of the bcg model ˇ        market growth rate is an inadequate descriptor of overall industry attractiveness ˇ        relative market share is inadequate as a description of overall competitive strength ˇ        the outcomes of a growth share analysis are highly sensitive to variations in how growth and share are measured ˇ        while the matrix specifies appropriate investment strategies for each business it provides little guidance on how best to implement those strategies ˇ        the model implicitly assumes that all business units are independent of one another except for the flow of cash  what is valuebased planning is a resource allocation tool that attempts to assess the shareholder value a given strategy is likely to crease it is a basis for comparing the economic returns to be gained from investing in different businesses pursuing different strategies from alternative strategies that might be adopted by a given business unit       assess the economic value a strategy is lively to produce by examining the cash flows it will generate rather than relying on distorted accounting measures such as return on investment        estimate the shareholder value that strategy will preduce by discounting its forecasted cash flows by the businesss riskadjustment cost of capital        evaluate strategies based on the likelihood that the investments required by a strategy will deliver returns greater tan the cost of capital   the amount of return a strategy or operating program generates in excess of the cost of capital is commonly referred to as its economic value added or evs  what are its limitations value based planning is not a substitute for strategic planning it is a tool for evaluating strategy alternative identified and developed through mangers judgments  it relies on forecast of many kinds to put a financial value on the hopes fears and expectations managers associate with each alterative  ie forecasts of sales volumes product mix unit price and competitive action  ideally what characteristics should strategic business units have ˇ        a homogenous set of markets to serve with a limited number of related

interact with one another  what are the major trends in the worlds population ageing of the worlds population caused primarily by declining mortality rates  rapid shift in the populations of lessdeveloped countries from rural to urban    describe the four major shifts taking place in the us population family structure closely structured family is less and less typical households because of divorce remarriage two wage earners etc ageing baby boomers    continue to dominate growth in the age groups they pass through en route to old age  geographic distribution immigrants account for nearly  of us annual growth and end up residing mostly in the large metropolitan areas of the south and west  migration of jobs and people to suburban cities  further and further form central cities ethnic composition diverse ethnically  of population is composed of racial minorities     define purchasing power parity further explain why an unadjusted per capital gnp substantially understates the spending power of urban households in the underdeveloped countries gross domestic product gnp measure economic performance of a country on a per capita basis after accounting for inflation in order realistically to compare incomes across countries it is necessary to use a purchasing power parity ppp approach that takes into account the cost of a standard basket of products expressed in us dollars for each country thus using a ppp analysis helps to compare the relative purchasing power of a given country for goods with what theses same goods would cost in the united states   ppp typically lower gdp per capita income for wealthier countries and higher ones for the poorer nations   despite leveling from ppp the gdp gap is less inflation increased between rich and poor countries  mainly because of higher population growth  ppp does not take into account the subsidies provided by many countries for such essentials as food utilities shelter transportation education and medical care which account for about half of the average household expenditures in developed countries  what are the major forces driving the competitive environment known as the macro environments globalization of business takes more resources to be a major global player the number of players become more and more limited  almost always results in a change in an industrys structure which makes it more difficult for entry as well as for competitors to survive technology rate and complexity has a strong impact on innovations in the production process and development of new and improved products vertical integration and mergers changing channels of distribution in retailing they have been numerous and far reaching include ˇ        fast growth of general merchandise discount stores operating cost lower than traditional retailers ˇ        direct marketing via telemarketing direct mail and internet ˇ        growth in vertical marketing systems that integrate producers wholesaler and retailer into a unified system designed to achieve lower costs while increasing market power  ie franchising examples of fast foods mcdonalds regulation  deregulation in us deregulation has had an impact on airlines trucking banking bringing more competition and regulation to telephone markets which had controlled of the seven baby bells the new legislation will open theses markets to competition and in exchange will permit the baby bells to compete in the longdistance market   changing values attitudes and lifestyles these are powerful engines of change as companies compete to take advantage of new trends  ie increase concern about physical fitness has been responsible for athletics clubs exercise equipment ect    describe what an opportunitythreat matrix is and how it can be used to help management identify evaluate and respond to environmental events an opportunitythreat matrix enables the examination of a large number of events in such a way that management can focus on the most important ones  in any given period many environmental events that could have an impact on the firm  either positively or negatively  may be detected  example  what are the ethical issues arising from the interaction of business and the environment ˇ        environmental impact ˇ        third world countries concerns for unhealthy working environments ˇ        third world countries use of child labour ˇ        high prices of third world countries for goods purchase pharmaceutical drugs  module  industry dynamics and strategic change  content questions  what are the various levels at which products can be defined industry includes an array of noncompeting products ie car industry product class may serve diverse markets  the more generic the definition the higher the aggregation level of products ie desserts versus pastries product type subsets of product class contain items that are technically the same brand level bottom of the aggregation hierarchy inappropriate units of analysis  sales largely function of managements strategic decisions    describe market hierarchies market hierarchy is a complex one to define since there are numerous ways markets can be arrayed  levels targeted the trend is towards greater specificity  that is towards targeting more precisely defined segments at the lower level in the hierarch eg johnson  johnson targeted children aged   years with a special line of bath products featuring winnie the pooh  describe what is meant by the product lifecycle concept sales history of a product and the sales change over time in a predictable way the product go through a series of five distinct stages each opportunities brings threats thereby affecting the strategy as well as marketing programmes    what are the characteristics and their implications of each of the product lifecycle stages  what are the strategic implications of the product life cycle  stages  characteristics and implications  strategic implications introduction purchase of new product limited because members of the target market are insufficiently aware of its existence and product availability  communications task at the outset to build awareness of the new products uniqueness expensive undertaking promotional expenditures product availability for trial both innovators and followers accelerate overall market growth and product acceptance through awareness trial and product availability growth as people learn about product and it becomes readily available sales increase at a progressively faster rate marketing mix changes prices tend to decline  price differences between brands decrease  sellers build channel or a direct sales system provide maximum product availability and service at lowest cost  this accomplished rivals at disadvantaged  promotion costs concerned with building demand for a companys brand  selective demand than demand for product class or type primary demand firms strive to build favorable attitudes toward their brand on unique features  promotion costs remain high typically decline as a percentage of sales increase competitive position shakeout  competitive turbulence stage growth slows as the number of buyers nears maximum and repeat sales become increasingly more important than trial sales as number of buyers and purchases stabiles price cuts weaker competitors leave the market stronger firms gain shares  major changes in industrys competitive structure occur  firms rationalize product line by eliminating weaker items emphasis creative promotional pricing and strengthen its channel relationships marketing mix changes more direct price competition firms make every effort to maintain and enhance their distribution system  reduce number of products carried weaker competitors  need to offer buying incentives to continue in the market   improvesolidify competitive position maturity sales plateau typically lasts some time net adoption rate holds steady adopters drop out and exceed new first time users longer stage lasts the more likely changes occur  if firm does not respond successfully to change its competitors do then a change in industry structure of significant may occur marketing mix changes various brands mare similar breakthroughs by rd or engineering help to differentiate product  options is to add value to product that benefits customer increase service distribution and instore displays become increasingly important as does effective cost management maintain position decline sales rate declines and product is said to have reached its final stage this may be gradual or extremely fast  sales decline costs increase and radical efforts are needed to reduce costs and the asset base  exit barriers are low  many firms vacate the market so increasing the sales of remaining firms there by delaying their exit  stronger firms may even prosper for a time         what are the major limitations of the product lifecycle concept major limitations lies in its normative approach to prescribing strategies based on assumptions about the features or characteristics of each stage  it fails to take into account that the product life cycle is in reality driven by market forces expressing the evolution of consumer preferences the market technology the product and competition the supply side  describe the adoption process the adoption process involves the attitudinal changes experienced by individuals from time they first hear about a new product serve or idea until they adopt it  the five stages in the adoption process are awareness person only aware of the existence of the new product insufficiently motivated to seek information about it interest individual becomes sufficiently interested in the new product but is not yet involved evaluation mental rehearsal stage individual is mentally applying the new product to his or her own use requirements and anticipating the results trial individual actually uses the product but if possible on a limited basis to minimize risk  only is the use experience is satisfactory with the product stand a chance of being adopted adoption individual not only continues to use the new product but adopts it in lieu of substitutes    what is the adoption rate a function of the time dimension is a function of the rate at which people in the target group move through the five stages in adoption process  depends on the following factors       risk cost of product failure or dissatisfaction       relative advantage over other products       relative simplicity of the new product       compatibility with previously adopted ideas       extent to which its trial can be accomplished on a smallscale basis       ease with which the central idea of the product can be communicated  what are the various adopter categories innovators first  of all individuals who ultimately adopt a new product  more venturesome more likely to be receptive to new ideas and tend to have high incomes which reduces the risk of a loss arising from an early adoption early adopters next    who adopt  part of local scenes often opinion leaders serve as vital links to members of the early majority group participate more in community organizations than do later adopters early majority  of those who adopt  display less leadership than early adopters tend to be active in community display less leadership than early adopters active in community affairs  thereby gain respect form their peers  do not like to take unnecessary risks and want to be sure new product will prove successful before they adopt it late majority another  frequently those individuals adopt a new product because they are forced to do so for either economic or social reasons  they participate in community activities less than the previous groups and only rarely assume a leadership role laggards last  they are the most local   participate less in community matters than any other groups and stubbornly resist change  adopt a product so late sometimes that it has already been replaced by another new product    describe the ways in which a product markets characteristics change as the market evolves product innovation diminishes over time  thus the sales of a new products those entering the market for the first time decline as percentage of total market volume form  during the growth stage of evolution to  during growth maturity to  and  during stable maturity and declining maturity and to  in the decline stage  this is know as pim profit impact of market strategy  what questions need to be answered in making an industry analysis       how profitable is the industry likely to be in the short term  or in the longer term        what are the more import industry characteristics       what are the industry driving forces a       changes in the markets longterm growth rate which directly affect investment decisions and intensity of competition b      changes in buyer segments which affect demand and strategic marketing programmes c       diffusion of proprietary knowledge which controls both the rate at which products become ore alike and the entry of new firms d      changes in cost and efficiency derived from scale and learning effects which have the potential of making entry more difficulty e       changes in government regulations which can affect entry costs bases on competition and profitability       what the essential determinants of success    what are the major forces which determine industry competition this is a part of industry analysis five interactive competitive forces that collectively determine an industrys longterm attractiveness present competitors potential competitors the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers and substitute products    module  consumer marketing and buying behaviour content questions  describe each of the four types of purchasing decision   extent of involvement extent of decision making high low extended information search consideration of brand alternatives complex decision making cars homes vacations limited decision making including variety seeking and impulse purchasing adult cereals and snack foods habit routine little or no information search focus on one brand brand loyalty athletic shoes adult cereals cologne deodorant inertia frozen vegetables paper towels    describe briefly the five steps consumers go through when purchasing high involvement products or services problem identification triggered by unsatisfied needs or wants perceive differences between in deal and actual states on some physical or sociopsychological dimension  seek products or services to help bring their current state more into balance with the idea information search how much information will a consumer seek source of information  personal  commercial  public evaluation of alternatives product attributes and their relative importance ie cost  performance social attributes availability purchase choosing a source from which to buy the product involves essential the same mental process ie mail order teleshopping catalogue retail store post purchase evaluation aspiration or expectation level how well the product was expected to perform post purchase dissonance consumer may doubt whether they made the best possible choices such doubts are called cognitive dissonance    how do lowinvolvement purchase decisions differ from highinvolvement ones they are not import to consumers the search for information to evaluate alternative brands is minimal  as a result decisions to buy products such as cookies or cereal often are made within the store either impulsively on the basis of brand familiarity or as a result of comparisons of the brands on the shelf  what are the marketing implications of lowinvolvement purchasing implications high involvement low involvement product design and positioning consumers evaluate alternative brands according to choice criteria that reflect the benefits they seek brand evaluation occurs after the product is purchased consumers seek brands that are least likely to give them problems focus on product features that minimize any problems in using the product advertising and promotion printed media are better for highly involved with the product and actively seeking information  passive information gatherer advertising should focus on a few main points to make it as easy as possible for them to gain familiarity and positive association with a brand  television is primary medium for advertising  allows passive learning distinctive package design helps consumers recognize brands they have seen advertised pricing   bought often on price alone special sales or coupon offers can be effective  if no problems experienced in use of trial consumers may continue to repurchase the brand out of inertia until a competitor offers an attractive price promotion distribution   extensive retail distribution important because consumers are unwilling to search for a particular brand strategies to increase consumer involvement   link product to some involving issue ie bran cereals associated their product with a high fibre diet that may reduce the incidence of colon cancer    describe the fishbein model by using an example attitude a  consumers overall attitude towards brand a bi  consumers belief concerning the extent to which attribute i is associated with brand a ii  the importance of attribute i to the consumer when choosing a brand to buy k   the total attributes considered by the consumer when evaluating alternative brands in the product category i  any specific product attribute   cruise ship selection service attribute importance weight   rating a rating b rating c demographics  other passengers     entertainment     ports of call       cruise a  xxx   cruise b  xxx   cruise c  xxx   cruise b would be selected  what is the difference between a compensatory and a noncompensatory model in a compensatory model a poor evaluation of one attribute can be offset by a strong evaluation on another  in a non compensatory model brands are evaluated one attribute at a time until one is superior    how do demographics and lifestyle have an impact on buying behaviour demographics influence       the nature of consumers needs and wants       their ability to buy products or services to satisfy those needs       the perceived importance of various attributes or choice criteria used to evaluate alterative brands       consumers attitudes toward and preferences for different products and brands   lifestyles             people live their lives in different ways ie different opinions interests and activities ie buying and using brands in different ways for different purposed  identify the major social influences on consumers decisionmaking processes social culture  set of beliefs attitudes and behaviour patterns relatively stable over time             sub culture  share common geographic ethnic racial or religious backgrounds  they continue to hold some values attitudes and behaviour pattern that are uniquely their own social class  status groups largely based on similarities in income education and occupation             reference groups groups that affect consumer behaviour through normative compliance valueexpressed influence and informational influence             the family  it serves as the primary socialization agent helping members acquire the skills knowledge and attitudes to function as consumers                                                       module  organisational markets and buying behaviour  content questions  what are the major differences between organisational and consumer markets organisational markets are about twice as large as consumer markets organisational buyers purchase goods and services for further production for use in operations or for resale to other consumers in contrast to individual and households who buy for their own use and consumption   differences between organisational and consumer markets demand characteristics the demand for industrial goods and services is  derived from the demand for consumer goods and services  relatively inelastic  price changes in the short run are not likely to affect demand drastically  more erratic because small increases in consumer demand can over time strongly affect the demand for manufacturing plants and equipment  more cyclical market demographics organisational buyers when compared with buyers of consumer goods are  fewer in number  larger  geographically concentrated  more apt to buy on specifications buyerseller relationships organisational markets are characterised by the following when compared with the markets for consumer goods  the use of professional buying specialists following prescribed procedures  closer buyerseller relationships  the presence of multiple buying influences    who are the major types of organisational customers resellers all retailers wholesalers  buy large quantities of goods for resale to other organisation or household consumers goods producers producers of raw materials such as farm and forest products firms and mines building contractors and manufacturers  service producers banks hotels lodgings financial insurance entertainment education government large buyers of goods and services    what groups of people are the participants in the buying process it involves people from various departments and can be users people who must use or work with the product or service influencers provide information for evaluating alternative products and services usually technical experts from various departments  help determine specifications and criteria to use in making the purchase decision gatekeepers control the flow of information to other people in the purchasing process primarily purchasing agents and suppliers salespeople control information that reaches other decision makers   buyers purchasing agent or purchasing manager buyers have authority to contact suppliers and negotiate the purchase transaction  deciders person who has the authority to make a final purchase decision    what factors determine the buying task faced by an organisation       the newness of the problem and the relevant buying experience of decision makers in the buying center       the information needs of the people in the buying center       the number of new alternative products andor suppliers to consider in making the purchase decision   three kinds of buying task or situations       straight rebuy purchasing common product or service the organisation has bought many times before  routine       modified rebuy  organizations needs remain unchanged but buying center members are not satisfied with the product or the supplier they have been using       newtask buying  organisation faces a new and unique need or problem  one in which buying center members have little or no experience in buying and thus must expend a great deal of effort to define purchasing specifications  describe briefly the organisational purchase decisionmaking process recognition of a problem or need ˇ        derived demand ˇ        requirements planning ˇ        determining product specification                                                        what are the marketing implications of the following categories of industrial goods and services category description characteristics marketing implication raw materials relatively unprocessed goods that become apportion of a final product limited supply few producers distribution is a key function price is a critical competitive variable  little promotional activity except for cooperative advertising campaigns funded by trade groups to stimulate primary demand for a product  component materials and parts processed goods that become a portion of a final product high volume purchases longterm contracts fierce competition among suppliers requires good service and nurturing of relationships with buyers   manufacturers buy most components materials and parts in large quantities usually sold direct without use of middlemen  wholesale distributors sell to smaller manufactures in some lines of trade  to avoid disrupting production runs sellers must ensure a steady reliable supply of materials and parts jit accessory equipment finished goods that facilitate production of a final product enduring but less os than installations more standardized more frequently purchased and less costly than capital equipment less complex buying intermediaries may be involved wide range of specific items it is hard to genralise about the most common or appropriate marketing strategies for accessory equipment  producers sell accessory equipment directly  presale and post sale service requirements are substantial but the monetary value of the average sale is high enough to justify direct distribution  personal selling either by the producers or a distributor sales force is the most important promotional method used in selling accessory equipment  products standarsied and not technically complex and thus advertising and brand name promotion are also important   installations major capital goods used to produce a final product but not part of the final product longlasting involved in production of many units of the final product over several years involve large monetary outlays capital budgeting committee involved in purchase decision sold directly from manufacturer presents real chanllege because there are few potential coustomers at any one time average sale is very large  many installations are custommade to fit a partcular customers needs therefore sellers must provide enginerring and design services before making a sale  often long perod of negotiation prior to fina transaction  firms sell installatin must usually provid emany post sale services ie installation training maintenance repair and sometimes financing  small number of buyers large monetary volue of each sale and custom engineering involved distriution usually dirct from producer to customer  some wholesale distributors provide replacement parts and repair services for equipment already in operation  for similar reasons promotional emphasis is usually on personal selling rather than advertising highcaliber welltrained salespeople are critically important in the marking of installations operating supplies finished goods that facilitate repair maintenance and ongoing operations analogous to consumer convenience goods frequently purchased and consumed in a short time standardized broad market heavy used of channel intermediaries purchased in small quantities by a great many different organizations wholesale middlemen typically used to distribute  price is usually critical variable in marketing operating supplies  competing products are quite standardized and there is little brand loyalty  personal selling by agents and distributors is also important business services provide special expertise to facilitate ongoing operations longterm relationships with customers suppliers qualifications experience and reputation critical to success purchase decision often made by top executives services are intangible purchased prior to evaluation by buyer suppliers qualifications past performance and reputation become critical determinants of the success of the marketing effort  price is less important in selling business services because a lawyer or consultant with an outstanding reputation can often charge much more for a given service than one who is less well know  even so rice often serves as an indicator of quality especially when there are no other quality cues module  marketing information and marketing research  content questions  describe market database systems and how they can be used point of sale pos database are used for direct marketing and prospecting programmes for companies that sell directly to end users  collecting demographic data and tracking purchases geodemographic database provide  types of data demographics geographics psychographics and consumer behaviour     define what is meant by the term marketing research the function which links the consumer customer and public to the marketer through information  information  used to identify and define marketing opportunities and problems generate refine and evaluate marketing actions monitor marketing performance and improve understanding of marketing as a process    what are the six steps in the marketing research process steps potential error  problem formulation management identifies the wrong problem or defines it poorly  determining information needs and data source management fails to identify the specific information needed for decisionmaking or the researcher uses the wrong source  research design including questionnaire ambiguous questions or poor experimental designs result in invalid responses  sample design and size sample procedures result in the selection of a biased sample   data collection errors are caused by nonresponse by poor selection of respondents by the interviewer or by  tabulation and analysis errors occur while transforming raw data from questionnaires into research findings  what is the difference between primary and secondary data sources primary are collected specifically for the problem at hand and require the firm to undertake the steps in the research process or hire an outside agency to do so secondary data collected by other organizations and are not usually tied directly to the firms problems  they have the advantage of saving time and money but the data must be compatible with the needs of the specific study    how can secondary source data be evaluated researchers must answer the question how good are the data if the source specifies the datacollection method used it can serve as the basis for the evaluation  if not the researchers are forced to judge the quality on the basis of other factors  ie research sponsors may be federal government or a trade association  and how data was collected ie by mail or personal interview  what is the difference between exploratory and conclusive research exploratory ˇ        uses secondary data case studies and interview with knowledgeable people ˇ        used to learn more about the nature and scope of the problem ˇ        preliminary step to be followed by conclusive research that tests the relevant findings ˇ        flexibility is key to the investigation conclusive comprises descriptive and experimental studies conclusive research to test alternative solutions to a problem studies      what is the difference between descriptive and experimental research descriptive often referred to as survey research more commonly used design experimental advantage of permitting the researcher to show causeand  effect relationships between the variables  something that can only be inferred from descriptive studies  some serious disadvantages that limit its usefulness in marketing       most experiments can measure only immediate results       expensive       use small samples that may not be representative of the national market       difficulty holding all variables constant       pose severe administrative problems can be audited by competitors    what are the major differences between probability and nonprobability sampling probability ensures that every unit in the universe has a known probability of being selected  this is the only method that enables the researcher to measure the reliability of the sample data  possible problems  minorities  or poor are underrepresented in phone or mail survey non probability does not provide every unit in the universe with a known probability of being included in the sample  thus the results cannot be generalize with any degree of certainty to a larger population is not objective unit included because the researcher thinks it should be      why is interviewing one of the major sources of error in a typical research project telephone and personal interviews an interviewer often selects the person to interview asks questions and records the answer and errors can occur at each step  respondents refuse to cooperate unable to remember information wanted biased by the interviewing process not want to report things that reflect poorly on their intelligence or social position does question mean the same to everyone interviewing respondents it the one major source of error in the typical research project  under what conditions would you use each of the various data collection methods questioning most common way   almost any problem can be attacked using it problems involving attitudes knowledge and buying intentions can be approached only by using this method  observation recognizes and notes people objects and actions rather than asking for information  less popular than interviewing respondents    what are the major kinds of data you would want to collect about a competitor examining data on their characteristics objectives strategies performance to date and their strengths and weaknesses in order to gain insights into their future behaviour   what two kinds of measures need to be merged to develop a meaningful measure of customer satisfaction the first has to do with understanding of the criteria used by customers to evaluate the quality of the firms relationship with them  knowing the productservice attributes that constitute the customers choice  criteria as well as the relative importance of each should facilitate this task  once these attributes are identified they serve as the basis for developing expectation measures the second type of measurement is concerned with how well the firm is meeting the customers expectations on an individual attribute as well as an overall basis thus if the choice criteria of a cruise lines target market included such attributes as food exercise facilities and entertainment then a performance measure would be developed for each   define the term marketing potential market measurements are critical in determining which markets to target what resources to allocate to each and whether the firms sales performance is each is satisfactory  how can one measure market potential via single factor index  researchers use it most successfully when the two items have a derived or complementary demand multiplefactor indexes   use a combination of two or more factors to estimate relative market potentials  multifactor index  what is a marketingdecision support system marketingdecision support systems mdss deals with the use of computer technology to enhance a marketers ability to identify and solve problem on a continuous dayin dayout basis using a marketingdecision support system    it coordinates collection of data systems tools and techniques with supporting software and hardware by which organisation gathers and interprets relevant information from business and its environment and turns into a basis for marketing action  highly flexible and action oriented  what is the future of mdss many have not progressed further in developing more sophisticated system  major reason risk involve din making large investments given the difficulty of estimating the return  al closely related problem is that the success of such system depends heavily on the decision making capabilities of the user  companies will adopt during the next decade  increasingly empowering mangers throughout the organisation to make bigger more complex decisions more quickly because of increased environmental dynamics  becoming a critically needed resource  what are the major ethical issues in marketing research potential to harm individuals when such information is used worth their knowledge oror consent leading them to be excluded from or included in activities in such a way that they are harmed economically psychologically or physically stem in large part from the interaction between the researcher and respondents clients and the general public  fir instance respondent should not be pressured to participate should have the right to remain anonymous and should not be deceived by fake sponsorship   module  market segmentation and market targeting content questions  define market segmentation involves subdividing the market place into distinct subsets of customers having similar needs and wants each of which can be reached with a different marketing mix lead them to respond in similar ways to a particular product offering and strategic marketing programme      classifications characteristics of the person nature of the situation in which the product or service any be purchased geography culture and subculture adopted by the consumer  why is there a strong interdependency between market segmentation market targeting and positioning determination of which segment target  to do so would require evaluating the relative attractiveness of each segment size revenue potential and growth rate the benefits sought and the firms relative business strengths  this is called target marketing finally product positioning  that is designing product offerings and developing strategic marketing programmes that collectively create an enduring competitive advantage in the target market  would need to be undertaken  all must be well considered and implemented if the firm is to be successful in managing a well considered and implemented if the firm is to successful   what is the rationale for market segmentation find an appropriate segmentation scheme that will facilitate market targeting product positioning and the formulation of successful marketing strategies and programmes   what are the benefits of market segmentation       identifies opportunities for newproduct development       segmentation helps in the design of marketing programmes that are most effective for reaching homogenous groups of customers       it improves the strategic allocation of marketing resources   why is market segmentation of growing importance       population growth has slowed       more product markets are maturing in turn sparks more intense competition as firms seek growth via gains in market share       social and economic forces as expanding disposable incomes higher education level and more awareness of the world       important rend toward micro segmentation  accelerated by new technology       implementation of specialized marketing programmes by broadening and segmenting their own services   what is the objective of the market segmentation process divide the market into groups of prospective buyers of a product or service who are relatively homogenous with regard to their demands   ideally the variances within individual groups would be relatively small   what are the different types of descriptors used to segment consumer goods industrial goods consumer and industrial macro  micro ˇ        physical ˇ        general behavioral ˇ        product relatedness behaviour ˇ        customer needs  describe the twostep process used to segment industrial markets macro segmentation divides the market according to the characteristics of the buying organisation using such descriptors a geography location company size and industry affiliation sic international counterpart of sic is the tradecategory code micro segmentation groups customers by the characteristics of the individuals who influent the purchasing decision for instance age sex and position within the organisation    what is geodemographic segmentation why is it becoming increasingly important it attempts to predict consumer behaviour by making demographic psychographics and consumer information available at the bloc and zip code levels   what are the requirements for effective segmentation       adequate size       measurability       accessibility       different response  what are the two emerging intercountry global segments identify consumers with similar needs and wants reflected in their behaviour in the marketplace across a range of countries   identifies consumer homogenous groups of consumers across country segments  why for many products are international markets becoming more homogeneous similar segments have emerged in different countries at the same time because of technological developments affecting communications transportation and travel  developing global

competitive position                   weight attractiveness and competitive position factors to reflect their relative importance                   assess the current position of each potential target market on each factor                   project the future position of each market based on expected environmental customer and competitive trends                   evaluate implications of possible future changes for business strategies and resources requirements  what are the three most common types of targeting strategy discuss each mass market       ignore any segment differences and design a single product and marketing program that will appeal to the larges number of consumers  capture sufficient volume to gain economies of scale and a cost advantage        design separate products and marketing programmes for the differing segments  differentiated marketing  niche market involves serving one or more segments that while not the largest consist of substantial numbers of customer seeking somewhat specialized benefits from a product or service   designed to avoid direct competition with larger firms pursing bigger segments growth market target one or more fastgrowth segments even though they may not currently be very large  favored by smaller competitors to avoid direct confrontation with larger firms while building volume and share for the future    discuss the major inclusion and exclusion ethical issues involved in market targeting inclusion undesirable stereotypes include sex role race or age stereotypes ie women a sex objects exclusion certain groups are deprived of the products or services but also that they may pay more for those they do receive   module  positioning decisions  content questions  what is meant by positioning differentiation  the perceived fit between a particular product and the needs of the target market  defined relative to competitive offerings and consumer needs   what are the differences between physical and perceptual positioning a business position its offering so that customers in the target market perceive it as providing the desired benefits thereby giving it an advantage over current and potential customers physical position offerings are based on comparison on some set of objective physical characteristics  what are the limitations of physical positioning a simple comparison of only the physical dimensions of alterative offerings usually does not provide a complete picture of relative positions because positioning ultimately takes place in customers minds   what are the steps in the positioning process                   identify relevant set of competitive products                   identify the set of determinant attributes that define the product space in which the positions of current offerings are located                   collect information from a sample of customers and potential customers about perceptions of each product on the determinant attributes                   analyze intensity of a products current position in customers minds                   determine products current location in the product space product positioning                   determine customers most preferred combination of determinant attributes                   examination the fit between preferences of market segments and the current positions of product market positioning                   select positioning or repositioning strategy  what are some of the more common types of bases used to distinguish one product or service from another

to portray a company as a good citizen   product class  new different product type   pricequality    country or geographic area  what constraints are imposed on a brand with an intense position developing a strong relationship between a brand and a limited number of attributes  what are the limitations of a product positioning analysis it indicates how alterative products or brands are positioned relative to one another in costumers minds  does not tell the marketer which positions are most appealing to customers   in choosing a given position for a given brand what factors should one consider market targeting analysis and the results of a market positioning analysis  position should match the preferences of a particular market segment and should take into account the current positions of competing brands  also reflect the current and future attractiveness of the target market and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the competitors   what is a product intent share product intent share represents the percentage of consumers who intend to buy a specific brand before actually searching for it  integrates all factors that influence the perceived qualities of a product  how can the purchase intent share that a brand might acquire in a given segment be estimated based on the positions of existing brands and the preferences of consumers in the segments  in a perceptual map obtained via multidimensional scaling   based on the distance between a brands position and the ideal points   what market dynamics should be considered in evaluating the sales

emerging attributes       development of new segments       introduction of new brands  describe each of the various market positioning strategies monosegment positioning developing a product and marketing programme tailored to the preferences of a single market segment  multisegment positioning position a product so as to attract consumers from different segments provides higher economies of scale requires smaller investments and avoids dispersion of managerial attention  standby positioning not in best economic interest of a firm to switch from multisegmeent position to monosegment assumes use several brands each positioned to serve the needs of only one segment only implement monosegment when forced to do so imitative positioning headon strategy where a new brand targets a position similar to that of an existing successful brand anticipatory positioning position anew brand in anticipation of the evolution of a segments needs this is particularly appropriate when the new brand is not expected to have a fast acceptance and market share will build as the needs of consumers become more and more aligned with the benefits being offered  adaptive positioning periodically repositioning a brand to follow the evolution of the segments needs defensive positioning when a firm occupies a strong position in a market segment with a single brand it is vulnerable to imitative positioning strategies  preempt competitive strategies by introducing similar poison for the same segment    part  developing strategic marketing programmes module  business strategies

different strategies why why not services can be thought of as intangibles and goods as tangibles  service can rarely be experienced in advance of the sale while goods can be experienced even tested before purchase many organizations are concerned with producing and marketing a service as their primary offering rather than as an adjunct to a physical product  have the same implications as those for goods producers  module   product and services decisions  content questions  what is a product describe its various components a product can be defined as anything that satisfies a want or need through use consumption or acquisition  it included subjects services places people activities and ideas  describe the four subgroups of consumer goods  what are the marketing strategy implications of

management process constrain a business units product strategy  especially market targeting and market positioning which have an impact on the composition of the product line and the attributes of individual products   how do the various stages in the product life cycle constrain product strategy as times change the environment in which the business unit competes the result is likely to be a change in its product strategy constrained by the products life cycle  what are the characteristics of a highshare global strategy       a drive for a strong international marketshare position       products with a high degree of international standardization       a marketing programme  especially price product line and advertising  geared to the mass market       large expenditures on design and rd relative to the industrys norm  because of the large volume of sales these costs on a unit basis are low       the use of regional production facilities or a rationalized global network designed to reduce logistics costs  under what conditions should a firm adopt a localization strategy the premise that products and programmes must be adapted to the needs and wants of individual countries because of environmental differences especially cultural ones   often occurs because of mandatory adaptation  that is the foreign market requires it   discuss briefly the effect of each positioning strategy on product decisions single mono product line is typically shorten than if it undertakes a multisegment positioning strategy in a defensive positioning strategy a firm with a successful brand introduces a second similar brand to preempt a competitors initiative strategy  similar to a flanker or fighting brand which counters the moves made by competitors by offering retailers certain price and advertising concessions   how does each of the three major types of business strategy constrain a firms product strategy prospector strategies center on newproduct development which encourages broad and technically advanced lines analyzers concerned with defending their established business either by using a low cost approach or by differentiating their product offering on the basis of quality and service  some attention to newproduct development defender similar to analyzers except the defenders devote fewer resources to the development of new products have smaller product lines on average and wherever possible differentiate themselves from competitors via service  three major types of business strategies constrain a firms product strategy with respect to its breadth technical sophistication quality and service  what are the eight dimensions of quality how do these affect a firms quality strategies performance has to do with a products basic operating characteristics features secondary product characteristics that are designed to enhance the products basic functions reliability is the probability that a product will perform satisfactorily over a given period  conformance the extent to which a products operating characteristics meet certain specifications durability measure of the life of a product technical replacement and economic repair cost serviceability concerned with the speed and ease of obtaining competent repair aesthetics how product looks feels sounds tastes and smells perceived quality results from the use of indirect measures since the consumer may lack or not understand information about a products attributes    how does branding benefit consumers sellers consumers simplifies shopping facilitates the processing of information concerned with purchase options provides confidence that the consumer made the right decision seller enhances effectiveness of their marketing programme promotion brand loyalty which in turn leads to greater profitability opportunities for successfully launching brand extensions prices and margins resulting from a competitive advantage channel relationships  under what conditions is branding particularly effective when it is difficult for the consumer to measure the products quality objectively  status large enough market to warrant the cost of branding differentiate product  why in america have high quality store brands gained considerable share as against national brands in the s the national brands regularly increased their prices along with making massive distributions of coupons thereby training consumers to shop on price  large number of line extensions and in general focused less on brand equity  taking advantage of the price vulnerability of many national brands  strong in the soft goods trade   discuss briefly the various branding strategy options individual branding each product has a distinctive name  ie proctor and gamble tide luvs crest pringles family branding same brand name to cover a group of products ie campbells soups sears kenmore appliances no brand brand name examples include generic nofrills unbranded  multipe brands strategy company deliberately competes against itself ie general motors buick versus oldsmobile versus pontiac    define each of the following line filling lengthens the product line by adding items within the present range  objective to satisfy more customers increase sales and profits line stretching  involves lengthening the product line beyond its current range of variables such as size and price  line extensions introduction of new products that differ significantly form those in the existing line certainly by more than just size and price   greater costs and financial risks than product line filling or stretching strategies    how does the fact that services are intangible affect marketing management differentiates service from a good  the degree to which a service is intangible affects the getting and keeping of customers  consumers are forced to buy the promise of a service  they are intangible hence marketers need to make them tangible to

taste test panels to elaborate computer analyses  describe a laboratory test market and how it operates mostly applicable to packaged consumer products mainly food household and some personal care items  the procedure measures the process by which a consumer adopts a new product  the process consists of three major steps  awareness trial and repeat buying  describe electronic minitest markets ac nielsen and information resources behaviour scan  the latter pioneered the technology that monitors the purchasing and viewing behaviour of a sample of household in eight or so small cities across the united states  panel member show their id card at the supermarket checkout a scanner records their purchases and the data are sent directly to a central computer   under what conditions would a firm be well advised to forgo a fullscale test market if the companys market share total sales and repeat buying measurements clearly exceed expectations there is no reason not to proceed with national distribution  describe briefly the various commercialization strategies forego market testing and move directly to a rollout region by region or nationally from the outset  extension of the fullscale test market which was designed to test a national introductory plan rollout test rather than an elaborate market test test area where the company has strong resources in order to lead from strength to get things moving multiple channels roll out  based on the tradeoffs between risk and the need to plan the cash flow for the introduction and the speed with which competitors are likely to react   what problems are involved in applying the newproduct development process to services testing a new service can pose problems since the presence of the consumer in the service system makes it difficult to develop a service that is uniform or consistent  service companies try to get around this problem in a variety of ways they use machines automatic bank tellers    what are the major ethical issues involved in the development of new products   business is critics for excessive production of metoo products leads to waste in the economic system  reverse that business fails to

content questions  why has price become a more important part of a firms marketing strategy in recent years slower growth the maturing of many basic industries improved productivity the growing power of retailers and their private labels and the increased aggressiveness of lowcost global competitors have made domestic markets more price competitive resulting in pricing and price competition becoming number one priority in the s  why is price an area in which managers feel the most pressure to perform yet the least certain they are doing a good job for the most part managers believe that they dont have control over price  the market dictates it yet anything closer to the right price can have a tremendous impact   what are the steps in the pricesetting decision process influences

strategy                   production and distribution costs per unit are likely to fall substantially with increasing volume                   low prices may discourage potential competitors from entering the market   describe a skimming price policy setting the price very high and appealing to only the least pricesensitive segment of potential customers  this can also be accomplished over time as in periodic discounting when the seller prices high at the beginning of each period and low at the end    used normally in pioneer development of a new product market  maximize shortrun profits  describe a harvesting price strategy maximize shortterm profits before demand for the product disappears  typically involves cutting marketing production and operating costs of the product while setting a relatively high price to maintain margins and maximize profits   what are the major factors affecting a customers sensitivity to price       buyers willingness to pay a given price for a product is influenced by their perception and preferences their needs desires awareness of and attitude towards the item in question       the price availability and attractiveness of alternative brands and substitutes products affect buyers willingness to buy the product       size of their incomes relative to the price influences customers ability to pay for a product or service taken together these factors determine the perceived value a potential customer will associate with a given productmarket entry and price he or she will pay  define the term elasticity of demand the larger the proportion of pricesensitive customers in a products market the more sensitive overall demand is to a change in the products price  the degree of responsiveness of demand to a price change is referred to as the price elasticity of demand    what is the formula for calculating the price elasticity of demand for a product or service   price elasticity of demand e  change in quantity demanded   change in price  what are the major problems in using this formula ˇ        failure to consider the response of competitors to the companys change in price ˇ        the demand may be inelastic for a given price change but elastic for a larger amount ˇ        that elasticity is measure din terms of sales revenues not profit margins one reason being that it does not take into account scale effects ˇ        a lowering of price may affect the sales of others in the companys product line ˇ        it ignores any societal benefits that may be accorded to the company for benefiting lowincome segments via a price reduction  what are the more common ways of estimating a products demand curve       approach is to survey a sample of consumers or bring them into a laboratory setting and ask them how much of the product they would buy at different possible prices validity is questionable       estimating the pricequantity relationship via the regression analysis of historical sales using consumer panel data       instore experiments where a products price is systematically varied or       multiple test markets   this is expensive  how can competitors costs and prices be estimated track the price cost and relative quality of each competitors offer competitors costs are harder to measure than their price  reverse engineering can be used to take apart competing products and examinee the cost of their components packing and production process   describe using an example costplus or markup pricing rateofreturn or target return pricing and breakeven pricing cost plus or mark up pricing is simply to add a standard markup to the cost of the product rateofreturn or target return this uses the same method as markup price but adds the cost of capital tied up in producing and distributing the product breakeven pricing   this is the variable cost per unit and fixed costs the volume necessary to just cover total costs   describe the various

a few large competitors  discount or premium price policies  base its pricing on what its competitors are charging but try to hold its price either below or above the competition sealed bidding buyers request a formal bid with no later opportunity for change  describe the various customeroriented pricing methods perceived value  potential customers usually have some idea of what constitutes a good or bad price  customary prices   consumers expect a single customary price for products ie candy bars at a customary price of  cents when cost put pressure on manufactures margins they reduced size of bar rather than upset customers expectation by raising the price price lining selling all products in a category at one of several predetermined price points or levels  each price line represent a different level of quality  psychological pricing users use price as an indication of quality promotional pricing most common type is sale the offer of a reduced price on a product for a limited time    define the following terms fob origin pricing the manufacturer places the goods free on board a transportation carrier  at this point the title and responsibility pass to the customer who pays the freight form the factory to the destination freight absorption pricing the seller picks up all or part of the freight charges  new competitors trying to penetrate new markets and smaller competitors in maturing industries trying to increase their share zone pricing is another compromise approach that falls between fob and uniform delivered pricing  here the company divides the country into two or more pricing zones  it charges all customers within the same zone the same delivered price but a higher price is set for distant zones than for those closer to the plant  describe the various forms counter trade can take barter direct  exchange of goods with no money and no third party involved compensation deals seller agrees to take some  of the payment in cash and the rest in goods buyback arrangements seller offers a plant equipment or technical exercise to a customer and agrees to accept a partial payment products manufactured with the equipment or training supplied

discounts cooperative advertising allowances and rebates trade or functional discounts a discount from the suggested retail list price  this discount is given to the wholesaler and  or retailer quantity discounts discount increases as order size increases cooperative advertising a temporary reduction in the products price  ie pepsis offer of  cans of soda for the price of a pack  allowance similar to discounts in they inducements to encourage channel members or final customers to engage in specific behaviors in support of the product  ie car is a tradein allowance   rebates rebates reduce the price of the product through a moneyrefund offer  example mail in rebate  what conditions allow for price discrimination not always possible or wise to set different prices for essential the same product        must be obviously be identifiable customer segments with different price sensitivities       either the customer segments must be physically separated from one another or  the firm must institute control procedures to ensure that the segment paying the lower price cannot resell the product o customers paying the higher price       the cost to the manufacturer of segmenting and monitoring the market should not exceed the extra revenue generated by the discriminatory pricing       the firm should be confident that resentment among customer asked to pay the higher price or competitive conditions in the market will not leave it vulnerable to competitive attacks in the high price segments       the firm should pay careful attention to the legal restrictions involved in price discrimination       module   distribution decisions  content questions  define a marketing channel the set of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a product or service

position in one or a few relatively substantial segments with potential for future profits   part  implementing  controlling strategic marketing programmes module   implementing business and marketing strategies  content questions  what are the three aspects of the relationship between corporate headquarters and the business unit that determine the sbus success in implementing a particular competitive strategy    the degree of autonomy provided to each business unit manager  the degree to which the business unit shares functional programmes and facilities with other units  the manner in which the corporation evaluates and rewards the performance of its sbu managers  successful implementation of a given strategy is more likely under what conditions when the business has the functional competencies demanded by its strategy and supports them with substantial resources relative to those of competitors is organized suitably for its technical market and competitive environment and has developed appropriate mechanisms for coordinating efforts and resolving conflicts across functional departments  what additional functionalarea competencies are needed for success for service organisations  especially those involving high customer contact service organisations  and manufacturers that provide high levels of customer service as part of their product offering  often need some additional functional competencies because of the unique problems involved in delivering quality service close coordination between operations sales and marketing is crucial also because many different employees may be involved in producing and delivering the service  production planning and standardisation are needed to reduce variations in quality from one transaction to the next similarly detailed policies and procedures for dealing with customers are necessary to reduce variability in customer treatment across employees all of this suggests that personnel management  particularly the activities of employee selection training motivation and evaluation  is an important adjunct to the production and marketing efforts of highcontact service organisations  organisational adaptiveness and innovativeness are enhanced under what conditions       decisionmaking authority is decentralised       managerial discretion and informal coordination mechanisms replace rigid rules and policies and       more specialists are present thus prospector business units and their marketing departments are likely to perform better when they are decentralised have little formalisation and are highly specialised  under what conditions is a functional type of organisation best to use and a productmanagement type functional type companies operating in stable and slowgrowth industries where the environments are predictable thus the form is appropriate for lowcost defender sbus attempting to maximise their efficiency and profitability in mature or declining industries product management type when an sbu has many productmarket entries this form adds an additional layer of managers to the marketing department usually called product managers brand managers or marketing managers each of whom has the responsibility to plan and manage the marketing programmes and to coordinate the activities of other functional departments for a specific product or product line  discuss briefly the recent organisational design developments managing of business processes in contrast to functional areas  every business has about six basic or core processes such as for example newproduct development and materials flow the former would be staffed by individuals from marketing rd manufacturing and finance the latter would contain people with expertise in purchasing manufacturing order delivery and billing   managing processes will make the organisation essentially horizontal  flat few layers and lean  in contrast to a vertical or hierarchical model thus executive positions will no longer be defined in terms of managing a group of functionally oriented people instead executives will be concerned with a process that strongly emphasises the importance of customer satisfaction  process management is quite different from the management of a function because       it uses external objectives  for example customer satisfaction rather than simple revenues       people with different skills are grouped to undertake a complete piece of work their work is done simultaneously not in sequence       information flows directly to where it is used thus if you have an upstream problem you deal with the people involved directly rather than via your boss  what are the more common international organisational structures functional type  would have vice presidents worldwide for such areas as manufacturing marketing and finance  all reporting to the president products based giving sbus worldwide control over their product lines the main advantages of this type of structure are the economies derived from centralising manufacturing activities and the ability to respond quickly to productrelated problems originating in overseas markets marketing is localised at the country or regional level area structure when there is considerable variance across markets regarding product acceptance and marketing activities firms typically organise on a regional basis north america latin america far east middle east and africa using a central staff that coordinates worldwide planning and control activities hybrid organisation combination of the functional product or area types of structure the global matrix is one such attempt it has individual business managers reporting to both area and functional groups or area managers reporting to business and functional groups thereby enabling the company to balance the need for centralised efficiency and its responsiveness to local needs but the dual reporting sets up conflicts and slows the management process to such an extent that many companies have returned to more traditional organisational designs  what are the major components of an annual marketing plan for a given product   i
