an admission that any such person is the beneficial owner of these securities for purposes of section  of the us securities exchange act of  as amended or for any other purpose         october   board of directors buffalo wild wings inc  wayzata boulevard suite  minneapolis mn   attn  sally smith dear members of the board as you know on august nd marcato submitted a standard and routine request for shareholder list materials so that we may communicate with our fellow shareholders of buffalo wild wings inc the “company or “bww”  unfortunately the company has still not complied with its obligations under minnesota law as the vast majority of the requested information – and virtually all useful requested information – remains outstanding  we are hopeful that management will agree to provide the remaining information promptly and without any further waste of company resources we are troubled by the lengths to which management has gone in an apparent attempt to thwart our communications with other shareholders and have no doubt that our fellow shareholders will find management’s behavior as disconcerting as we do  we were further troubled to hear of your decision on october th to appoint three new directors to the company’s board a decision made unilaterally and without consultation with the company’s shareholders  these new appointments were clearly intended to create the false impression of meaningful change but without actual engagement in constructive dialogue with shareholders  these actions are an unfortunate continuation of the company’s pattern of entrenchment obfuscation and poor decision making  accordingly we are writing this letter to alert you and our fellow shareholders of the company’s obstructionist behavior in the hope that you will instruct management to immediately put an end to it it has now been more than seven weeks since marcato—a  stakeholder in bww—requested a limited amount of information for the purpose of communicating with fellow shareholders  as i’m sure you know marcato has an unassailable right under minn stat § a to receive this information  other public companies routinely provide such information to shareholders without question or delay when presented with similar requests  this is in fact the very same information that bww is already using itself—we are merely seeking to have a “level playing field” with the company it should not take nearly two months to produce the company initially refused to acknowledge that marcato owned any bww shares  specifically company counsel stated that the schedule d which we filed with the us securities and exchange commission on august   a copy of which was enclosed with our request was “insufficient to demonstrate that any particular entity was a shareholder of bww as of august  ”  company counsel insisted that we provide a brokerage account statement evidencing marcato’s ownership  when asked to explain our attorneys were told by your counsel that marcato “could have sold all of its shares” since the d filing  to put it another way management appears to have envisioned a scenario in which marcato submitted a shareholder list request after it sold all of its bww holdings without disclosing the sale in a subsequent d amendment  it’s a scenario that defies logic  company counsel then conditioned providing any information on marcato entering into an onerous confidentiality agreement that went well beyond what was required by law  surely management must have understood that providing a draft agreement with such terms served no purpose other than to further delay our communications with other shareholders nevertheless we reached out in good faith with a draft confidentiality agreement reflecting an accommodating approach  we also provided the account statement as requested  in return company counsel asserted that marcato capital management lp “marcato capital” was not a proper party to the shareholder list request “given that the applicable statute requires the shareholder to own stock as of the dated sic of a demand”  we were surprised by this response given that minn stat § a explicitly states that a “beneficial owner” has an “absolute right” to demand shareholder list materials and that marcato capital was clearly a beneficial owner  your counsel then demanded that marcato capital provide copies of its confidential investment advisory agreements to prove that it was a beneficial owner of common stock after multiple rounds of back and forth with counsel management backed off its unsupported demands and conceded that we were shareholders and entitled to receive materials  we were optimistic we were putting this episode behind us  unfortunately when the materials we were promised finally arrived by email the information we were given was incomplete outdated and virtually useless  these materials included · transfer agentlevel shareholder lists of the holders of record of the company’s common stock dated as of september   and march    these lists did not provide any information regarding the identities or holdings of the actual beneficial owners of the common shares – information necessary to communicate with them and which is not only customarily provided but legally required to be provided and   · a list of holders of company shares held through employee benefit plans dated march    this list is over sixmonths old and only provides information with respect to approximately  of the company’s outstanding shares   in other words management chose to disclose only the holders known to the company’s transfer agent  you undoubtedly are aware that as with every other public company virtually all bww shareholders hold their shares in “street name” through accounts with banks brokers and other financial intermediaries  the distinction between the two is critical and widely understood  the information we were provided contains no relevant or useful information about the actual shareholder base  that the company would respond to our request in such a perfunctory manner is deeply disappointing it is clear that in providing this information management’s intent was to inhibit or delay our communications with other shareholders  in this regard it does not appear to be a mere coincidence that the information that management is refusing to provide us is also that which would facilitate such communications  in particular the company’s response included neither a list of non objecting beneficial owners “nobo” nor any information obtained from the depository trust company “dtc”  this is information that is easy to generate on a rolling basis as we have requested  it’s not much harder than pushing a button  and doing so would cost the company nothing as we have committed to cover the expense if management’s true intent was to allow marcato to communicate with other bww shareholders it would have provided all of the information requested in our august nd letter including · contact information that was omitted in the company’s response eg telephone numbers with respect to each record holder and employee plan a “plan” participant   · dates on which each record holder became a holder of record of shares   · name business address and telephone number of the plan’s trustee or administrator   · detailed explanation of the voting treatment of a shares of company stock “stock” for which a trustee or administrator receives instructions from plan participants and b shares of stock for which either the trustee or administrator does not receive instructions or shares of stock which are outstanding in any such plan but are unallocated to any participant   · complete record or list of the holders of stock and respondent banks and their email addresses who have elected to receive electronic copies of proxy materials with respect to meetings of stockholders of the company pursuant to rule aj of the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act”   · all information in possession or control of the company or any of its transfer agents registrars or proxy solicitors or which can reasonably be obtained from dtc brokers dealers banks clearing agencies voting trustees or their respective nominee concerning the names addresses telephone numbers and number of shares of stock held by the participating brokers and banks named in the individual nominee names of cede  co specifically with respect to cede  co the daily dtc security position reports or other similar depositories or nominees including respondent bank lists all omnibus proxies and related respondent bank proxies and listings issued pursuant to rule b under the exchange act   · all information in or that comes into the company’s or its transfer agents’ registrars’ or proxy solicitors’ possession or control or that can reasonably be obtained from brokers dealers banks clearing agencies voting trustees or their respective nominee including broadridge financial services and mediant communications relating to the names addresses and number of shares of the beneficial owners of stock pursuant to rule bc or rule bc under the exchange act including a nobo list and   · updates to all of the information described above on a rolling basis going forward these materials should be provided to us promptly  we have no desire to engage in litigation as a means to resolve the issues outlined in this letter  however we are quickly approaching a point where management’s obstinate resistance will leave us with no other choice and your recent actions have only exacerbated our concerns that shareholders’ interests are not being served by the board as currently composed  accordingly we reserve all rights and remedies we look forward to hearing from you

exceedingly optimistic about the future of buffalo wild wings  in the crowded and competitive restaurant universe buffalo wild wings offers an experience that is superior to and highly differentiated from those offered at any of the sportsthemed competitors in its markets  the benefits of its national scale from marketing to purchasing to best practices will continue to position buffalo wild wings as the preferred destination to experience televised sports outside of the home  in fact we think the company’s estimated addressable market of  units compared to  expected by yearend  in the united states and canada may be far too low and deserves to be revisited we also believe however that buffalo wild wings must make substantial changes to its business practices if it hopes to reach its full potential both as a company and in terms of shareholder value  our initial conversations with management focused on the company’s capital allocation decisions which we discuss below and detail in our attached analysis  following months of engagement with the company we have come to appreciate that suboptimal capital allocation behavior is symptomatic of a larger organizational deficiency a tendency to favor gut feel and thematic proclamations without   tangible evidence or appropriate analytical support  the management team of buffalo wild wings communicates its strategic and financial rationale to the investment community with inveterate avoidance of specificity  the chronic absence of detail around even the most basic of metrics causes us to question whether the right questions are being asked and answered we direct this concern not only toward management but also toward the board of directors whose duty is to oversee evaluate and incentivize management in such a way as to ensure that the business is run in shareholders’ best interests  we are committed to doing our part to help the business achieve its full potential  we expect that the necessary changes will include the following  the introduction of fresh talent at both the board and management levels   the company must improve its experience and sophistication in areas of restaurant operations franchise system development corporate finance and capital markets  we are confident that the board would benefit from adding independent directors with operating experience in the restaurant industry in particular with a franchised restaurant concept  we note that no current director has direct restaurant operating experience outside of the ceo  we would also stress that any changes to the board should only be made after consultation with interested shareholders and we would view any unilateral action to change the composition of the board as a hostile act of entrenchment  a greater focus on operational excellence within buffalo wild wings’ core business   the company must improve in key operational areas such as food quality pricevalue perception speed of service technology implementation food cost optimization and labor engineering – all areas where it is substantially underperforming its potential and that if improved can drastically help restore the company’s customer value proposition efforts to drive “growth” primarily through new unit openings and franchisee acquisitions currently take unwarranted precedence over maximizing samestore sales and restaurantlevel margin opportunities at core buffalo wild wings  over the longterm neither system growth nor franchisee acquisitions will be able to compensate for a decline in the profitability of the core concept  cessation of “emerging brands” growth plans   buffalo wild wings’ continued success is not an inevitability as such we believe the company should remain singularly focused on its largest earnings driver rather than placing wild bets however small on hitormiss “growth drivers”— particularly those in the highly competitive noncore fast casual space  experiments with new restaurant concepts are distracting management from advancing buffalo wild wings’ core brand  at this point in time any corporate resources be they personnel capital or attention would be better allocated to addressing the operational improvement opportunities at core buffalo wild wings  a profound increase in urgency followthrough and accountability   a review of past years’ earnings reports reveals a number of company “priorities” that have since dragged on without meaningful progress the most obvious example being the bungled roll out of tableside order and pay functionality  the commentary in the current period regarding the nearterm goals        for these programs is the same that it was two and three years ago despite the company having missed its initial execution objectives  even now management is content to highlight the opportunity while very little tangible progress has been achieved  this issue is representative of a much larger issue of management’s persistent failure to execute and the board’s failure to hold management accountable    an audit of managerial decision tools and a reconciliation of business outcomes as compared to forecasts  despite frequent assurance from management of the use of dcf and irrbased forecasts to approve investments such as remodel campaigns new unit openings or acquisitions our experience with retail and restaurant businesses has taught us that those processes can be highly flawed we take seriously the tendencies of development staff to reverseengineer projections to achieve a stated hurdle rate or highlight data with a selection bias to support past decisions  the board must review past capital investments to ensure that outcomes compare favorably with the underwriting process  we recommend starting with an assessment of the company’s large franchisee acquisition in  which based on all available data has been an unmitigated disaster  that such an obviously misguided decision could be made under the guise of rigorous analysis underscores the weaknesses in the company’s capital allocation processes and need to commit to a disciplined capital allocation program the list above speaks to functional changes that will improve business performance  at a higher level however there is an intellectual divide that must also be addressed there is a glaring deficiency of understanding at the company in how capital deployment relates to shareholder value creation  yesterday’s announcement of a  million share repurchase authorization further highlights this point management selfidentifies its objectives to be those of a “growth company” but does not appear to have a clear sense of what that exactly means or how and if achieving this poorly defined “growth” objective is best for shareholders  growth in revenue or earnings simply cannot be evaluated without consideration for the capital deployed in the achievement  this basic principle of corporate finance is tragically underappreciated by the current management team instead management celebrates consolidated revenue growth without discriminating between revenue derived from growth in royalties from franchisee unit development samestore sales growth itself a product of tension between higher price and declining traffic new companyoperated unit growth and the purchase of units from franchisees  each of these revenue streams has a radically different margin profile and comes at a radically different capital cost franchise royalties in particular come at no cost whatsoever  most importantly the income derived from each of these different revenue streams receives a radically different value in the market due to its unique degree of capital intensity and predictability  management and the board should be solely focused on growing market value per share determining which types of revenue growth will best deliver that outcome  additionally management frequently highlights growth in average unit volumes but fails to acknowledge that this growth has been accompanied by an increase in per unit construction and preopening costs from k in  to m in  leading to a significant decline in the returns on invested capital  we perceive that the pursuit of higher average unit volumes management’s barometer for “growth” has led the company to deploy evergreater amounts of capital into larger units tailored to more populous but also more competitive and more expensive markets  similarly remodel costs for the current stadia program are increasing over prior remodel budgets and the company has not articulated the basic return on investment methodology that illustrates why the new remodels are attractive why the current remodel cost is appropriate or if similar outcomes could be achieved at a lower cost  might shareholders and customers alike be better off if capital were instead invested into smallerformat units that at the expense of lower auv’s could profitably succeed in smaller less competitive markets with lower construction and operating costs producing higher returns on capital management appears to believe that realizing its identity as a “growth” company means delivering eps growth of  or greater  however even this statement is made without any design as to how that will be achieved  beneath the headline there is no calculus as to how samestore sales operating margin expansion franchise vs company unit growth franchisee acquisitions and share repurchases will combine to produce such a result  just how this earnings goal is achieved and in particular how much capital is required to achieve it will dictate the multiple of eps at which the shares will trade  this is the vital and missing link between earnings creation and shareholder value creation   the apparent lack of sensitivity to this connection is the primary impediment to shareholders earning an attractive return on their investment in the future unfortunately for shareholders the easiest growth to come by has been the kind that is bought requiring the most capital and offering the lowest returns  as samestore sales have decelerated and the law of large numbers has made it difficult for new unit additions to sustain historical revenue growth rates management has turned to buying in franchisees in its pursuit of “growth”  the large franchisee acquisitions in  were telegraphed to investors under the pretense of being “opportunistic” as helping the company achieve its goal of growing sales and net income  at the same time the company did not offer any concrete rationale for why this transaction would create more shareholder value than allowing the units instead to be sold to a third party buyer – an outcome that would have retained the existing highvalue franchise royalty stream and avoided a major capital outlay at an excessive and unprecedented multiple and moreover would have avoided the additional cost and distractions of transaction fees remodel requirements regional ga investments integration risks and operational complexity despite the company’s refusal to disclose key financial metrics of the transaction it is clear to us that the acquisitions of  were mistakes and would not be approved today if an appropriate methodology were employed  this acquisitive behavior is almost certainly reinforced by an incentive compensation system designed by the board that rewards if not preconditions management for maximizing absolute growth in revenue dollars net income dollars and store openings – all metrics that fail to acknowledge the capital required to achieve these outcomes and whether the returns on that capital investment are appropriate  in contrast most other highperforming restaurant companies emphasize metrics more explicitly tied to shareholder value including operating income not sales  eps not net income and roic and total shareholder return  all of which are absent from management’s incentive compensation design we are confident that buffalo wild wings is in a strong position to compete and succeed in the future however we believe this opportunity will be squandered if our concerns highlighted here are not addressed with urgency  we look forward to a vigorous discussion of these factors with the board and management going forward sincerely mick mcguire cc dale applequist cynthia davis compensation committee michael johnson

ones in a michelinstarred restaurant or a studio apartments kitchen however the most important tools in the kitchen are the cookware and bakeware that chefs and cooks use to create their culinary masterpieces look to walmart for the right pieces in your home kitchen so that you can make an array of complete meals latenight snacks and delicious baked goods for your family and friends all at every day low prices cookware more than any other nonutensil you use in the kitchen nothing gets more use than your pots and pans although there are sets that contain    or more pieces including lids there are usually two or three goto pieces that you use for nearly every meal these include a small or medium pot large saut pan or skillet and a dutch oven with just those three pieces you can cook nearly everything you might consider preparing in the kitchen if you have room additional pieces of cookware make for nice additions which is why the sets of cookware that you can buy make so much sense if you have the room a good set of cookware should contain two differentsized saucepans with lids two or three differentsized skillets a deep saucier pan for deep frying and a dutch oven or stock pot lids for these pans may be interchangeable as many of them are the same diameter as each other the material that makes up the cookware is just as important as how many pieces you have stainless steel is very versatile and reliable as it can take high heat easily going from the stove to the oven and cleans up somewhat easily although it requires cooking with some form of fat such as oil or butter to prevent food from sticking nonstick pans are ideal for those who are concerned about cleanup but some of these pans are not suitable for oven use and you must only use wooden or silicone utensils with them to prevent damaging the nonstick coating triply pans that have a copper core encased between two layers of stainless steel known as clad are ideal cookware as these heat food more evenly other options available include aluminum ceramic copper and hardanodized other cookware items you may want to have on hand include castiron pans or carbon steel pans these pans after being seasoned have a natural nonstick ability to them additional items to consider include grill pan ideal for those who cook meats like steak indoors and want to have grill marks on their food double boiler makes it possible to create delicate sauces like hollandaise sauce or temper items like chocolate without burning them large stock pot makes it easy to boil long pasta or seafood like whole lobster wok useful for cooking over flame at high temperatures such as when stirfrying vegetables and meat pressure cooker makes large cuts of meat in a shorter time as it uses steam and cooks under pressure resulting in tender foods roasting pan ideal for use in the oven to make large roast or fowl like a turkey bakeware although they are often used for baking breads and sweets bakeware items are used quite often for general cooking purposes as well one of the most important items to have are sheet pans sheet pans are great for making baked goods like cookies but they also work well when roasting vegetables and broiling cuts of meat theyre also very handy when you need to hold food items in a warm oven while you finish the rest of the meal working hand in hand with sheet pans are silicone mats which provide nonstick ability to pans that would have to be heavily oiled otherwise cookie sheets are like sheet pans except that have no raised edges allowing bakers to remove baked items more easily there are many pans that can be part of the home bakeware arsenal these include cake pans which can be round square or rectangular springform pans which are ideal for delicate baked
