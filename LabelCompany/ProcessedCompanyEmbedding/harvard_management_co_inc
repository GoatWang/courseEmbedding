 investment philosophy  risk management harvard management company sustainable investments investing for the longterm as a longterm investor hmc is focused on material environmental social and governance esg factors that may impact the performance of our investments now and in the future esg factors are conditions circumstances or issues that can be found in areas such as energy consumption greenhouse gas emissions climate change resource scarcity water use waste management health and safety employee productivity diversity and inclusion supply chain risk management human rights including workers’ rights and effective board oversight we believe that considering esg risk factors in our investment analysis and decisionmaking processes is aligned with our mission to help ensure that harvard university has the financial resources to confidently maintain and expand its preeminence in teaching learning and research for future generations approach to sustainable investment a threepronged approach guides hmc’s sustainable investment work and priorities  esg integration — incorporate material esg factors into manager selection appointment and monitoring  listed equity active ownership — exercise our client’s shareholder voting rights  collaboration — work with global investors and endowments to develop and define sustainable investment best practices this approach is reflected in our engagement with the principles for responsible investment pri an initiative supported by the united nations that works with a global network of investors who are committed to integrating esg issues into their investment practices hmc with the support of harvard university is the first university endowment in the united states to become a signatory to the pri as a signatory hmc is committed to implementing the pris six principles in our management of the universitys endowment and related financial assets hmc reports to the pri on an annual basis about our sustainable investment activities and the resulting transparency report is published by the pri esg integration hmc applies its due diligence framework to its commingled funds in absolute return private equity and public markets the due diligence process includes reviewing the esg policies and governance of potential fund investments identifying how the fund integrates esg factors into its investment decisions and determining how the fund communicates esg information to its limited partners depending upon the nature of esg issues identified we may also seek to include esg terms in the investment fund term sheet throughout the life of an investment we monitor identified esg risks and work with managers to ensure effective oversight we also write letters to our team of external managers to inform them of our focus on sustainable investment and commitment to the pri principles the letter encourages managers to open a dialogue with hmc about their own approach to sustainable investment and how esg factors impact its investment analysis and decisionmaking processes esg integration also plays a significant role in our natural resources investments and real estate investments listed equity active ownership harvard university regularly exercises its right to vote on shareholder resolutions many of which present issues related to esg matters in considering proxies on environmental and social matters we work closely with the university’s corporation committee on shareholder responsibility and advisory committee on shareholder responsibility through the work of those committees the university provides instructions on voting proxies related to environmental and social issues shareholder resolutions related to corporate governance matters are typically addressed by hmc the university issues a publicly available annual report on the work of shareholder responsibility committees in regard to the voting of proxies collaboration we have joined initiatives that are aligned with—and help guide—our approach to sustainable investment and we actively work with peers and investors to advance shared goals for example hmc is an active member of the pri investor working group on corporate climate change lobbying this initiative urges businesses to take action on climate change including through lobbying actions that are consistent with the goal of preventing climate change as a lead investor of this working group the harvard endowment is a signatory to the investor expectations on corporate climate lobbying setting out expectations for company practice and disclosure on climate change related policy activity harvard is also a signatory to the pri’s global statement on investor obligations and duties this statement calls for policymakers to clarify investors’ obligations and duties in particular in relation to the integration of esg issues into investment practice in turn the statement calls for investors to take account of esg issues in their investment processes and decisionmaking encourage high standards of esg performance in the companies or other entities in which they are invested and support the stability and resilience of the financial system members of hmc’s compliance team have joined the pri’s hedge fund advisory committee this committee aims to develop tools to facilitate the implementation of esg factors in the investment process across the hedge fund industry current projects include a responsible investment due diligence questionnaire for hedge funds as well as an industry guide for asset owners we are also a signatory to the cdps climate change program the cdp formerly known as the carbon disclosure project is an international nonprofit organization that works with governments public companies and over  institutional investors to drive environmental disclosure and performance of publicly listed companies ethical considerations and investment exclusions as an academic institution harvard holds its endowment funds in trust to advance its programs of education and research which constitute the university’s distinctive way of serving society these funds have been given to harvard by generous benefactors over many years to advance academic aims not to serve other purposes however worthy as such the university maintains a strong presumption against divesting investment assets for reasons unrelated to the endowment’s financial strength and its capacity to further harvard’s academic goals harvard conceives of the endowment fundamentally as an economic resource not as a lever to advance political positions or to exert economic pressure for social purposes which could entail serious risks to the independence of the academic enterprise and the ideal of free inquiry at the same time the university recognizes that very rare occasions may arise when companies’ activities are so deeply repugnant and ethically unjustifiable as to warrant the university’s institutional dissociation from those activities in recent decades such ethical considerations have led the harvard corporation to instruct hmc not to own shares in certain companies involved in the perpetuation of apartheid in south africa in the manufacture of tobacco products and in enabling genocide in darfur when on rare occasions the university issues investment restrictions limitations and instructions to hmc we extend these restrictions to direct holdings by our internal portfolio managers as well as to direct holdings by investment advisers trading in the name of president and fellows of harvard college through separatelymanaged accounts we do not extend these restrictions to investment advisers of commingled funds where harvard is not the sole investor sustainable investment policy sustainable investment policy we believe that considering esg risk factors in our investment analysis and decision making is aligned with our goal of providing strong longterm investment results to harvard
