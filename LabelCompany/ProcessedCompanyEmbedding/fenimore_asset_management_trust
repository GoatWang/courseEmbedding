statement of additional information dated may   are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus i nvestment objective fam value fund’s investment objective is to maximize longterm return on capital fees and expenses of the fund the tables below describe the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund   shareholder fees fees paid directly from your investment investor shares maximum sales charge load  on purchases none maximum deferred sales charge load none redemption fee none   annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment   investor shares management fees  distribution and service b fees none other expenses  total fund operating expenses  fee waiverexpense reimbursement  net fund operating expenses   “other expenses” have been restated based on current contractual arrangements and are estimated for the current fiscal year  the advisor has contractually agreed until may   to waive fees andor reimburse the fund certain expenses excluding interest taxes brokerage costs acquired fund fees and expenses dividend expense and extraordinary expenses to the extent necessary to maintain net fund operating expenses for investor shares at  the fund has agreed to repay the advisor for amounts waived or reimbursed by the advisor pursuant to the expense limitation agreement provided that such repayment does not cause the net fund operating expenses for investor shares to exceed the above limit and the repayment is made within three years after the year in which the advisor incurred the expense this expense limitation agreement may only be amended or terminated by the fund’s board of trustees expense example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be   expense example year year year year       portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the fund’s performance during the most recent fiscal year the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio   principal investment strategies fenimore asset management inc “fenimore” the investment advisor to the fund employs a “value approach” in making its common stock selections this approach is based on fenimore’s belief that at any given point in time the stock price of a company may sell below the company’s “true business worth” factors considered in evaluating the true business worth include the company’s current earnings and fenimore’s opinion as to its future earnings potential after identifying a company whose securities are determined to have a favorable pricetoearnings relationship fenimore plans to invest in such securities until the “true business worth” nears the market price of the company’s securities   generally the fund will attempt to remain fully invested in common stocks and securities that are convertible into common stocks such as convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks the fund may invest in the securities of issuers of all sizes and market capitalizations the fund may also invest in the securities of both domestic and foreign issuers and it may invest in shares of other investment companies including exchange traded funds “etfs”   principal risks • stock market risk  the value of stocks fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general stock market and economic conditions stock prices may decline over short or extended periods of time stocks are more volatile and riskier than some other forms of investments • stock selection risk  the value stocks chosen for the fund are subject to the risk that the market may never realize their intrinsic value or their prices may go down • smallcap risk  small capitalization companies may not have the size resources or other assets of large capitalization companies • market risk  the value of your investment will go up and down which means that you could lose money • foreign investment risk the fund may invest in securities of foreign issuers that are traded in foreign markets or may be represented by american depository receipts that are traded in the united states investments in non us securities may involve additional risk including exchange rate fluctuation political or economic instability the imposition of exchange controls expropriation limited disclosure and illiquid markets • investment in other investment companies risk – the fund may invest in shares of other investment companies including etfs shareholders of the fund will indirectly be subject to the fees and expenses of the other investment companies in which the fund invests in addition shareholders will be exposed to the investment risks associated with investments in other investment companies   annual total return the following bar

more information regarding the funds long term performance and investment style please see the following and the profile on page   was also a year in which our mutual fund organization added a second fund to our fund family with the opening of the fam equityincome fund in april over the past tenyear period we have consistently applied our investment philosophy to managing the fam value fund and seen it through some tremendous market movements since its inception on january   your fund grew from share to share through december   in addition distributions totaled  for the same time period the dow jones industrial average moved from  to  not only did the stock market experience the second largest correction of its history in  it also soared to record new highs during  it was certainly an exciting time period for investors even with all the changes that have occurred around us we can assure you that we have made no changes in our investment philosophy or the way that we manage your fund we continue to focus on achieving long term conservative investment returns by utilizing a value approach we look for good businesses in industry groups that we can understand and evaluate ones that are run by able management teams and those which are financially strong and selling at a reasonable price together these elements comprise fenimores investment philosophy it is an approach that we have found consistently beneficial over long periods of time and one which we will adhere to in the future as well  total return  years ended december    average final value annual of a  rate initial investment  fam value fund    russell  index    sp  index     performance for  can best be summarized by saying that not everyone invited went to the ball your fund increased  during the  months ending december    much less than the  rise of the sp  composite index which is weighted with companies considerably larger than those in fam value fund our return compares more favorably to the  gain of the russell  index  a composite of companies with smaller market capitalizations like ours while we are not fully satisfied with our short term performance we are confident that our objective of providing you with long term superior results will occur a review of  also indicates that what may be good in one year may not always be helpful in the next the fund was negatively impacted in  by two outstanding performers for the year  conmed which gained  in  dropped back  in  and sage laboratories was off  after being up  in  also ccor electronics which has been a stellar performer in the past hurt your fund in   we still hold these stocks because the businesses are on track and we believe much more valuable than what current prices reflect on the positive side your fund was impacted favorably by mailboxes etc  kaydon  and american express  occasionally we will invest in a large company if we feel it is severely undervalued this year those decisions paid off for your fund since it is unusual for the investment climate to remain the same year after year we will stick to our long term approach of finding value normally this occurs in the smaller company arena going forward we continue to feel very strongly about our investments in the financial sector particularly banks and insurance companies banks which represent  of the portfolio were trimmed a bit during the year because of takeovers fourth financial was purchased by boatmans and hawkeye by mercantile another good performer for us transworld bancorp will be taken over in  for  per share in cash by glendale federal transworld is a bank that was an original purchase for the fund in  it has a topnotch management team we didnt see a lot of performance in the early years but it has compounded at  for the time we have held it with those results we could make a good case for a tenyear holding period a lot of people ask us how we are going to get out of some of these small company positions the cases mentioned above illustrate that with patience value generally flows to the top either by takeover or by market recognition we still own a lot of financials and feel the consolidation process is going to continue in the future in the insurance area niche players  whether thats property and casualty insurers or life insurers  seem to have the same kind of financial and economic fundamentals that you would find in a very good industrial or technology company yet sell at much lower multiples for example we have held a company in the insurance area allied group for a long period of time and it has performed very well allied groups return on equity has been in excess of  for many years and its growth rate has been in the double digits its a well managed niche property and casualty company yet right now its selling at x estimated  earnings here is a company that in other marketplaces would sell at x earnings at least we know that earnings are strong and that the fundamentals are very positive  and beyond what gives us confidence about the future is partially based on the past our long term performance record of  compounded over ten years is favorable when compared to the russell  index however over the past decade we along with many of our competitors have been bested by the sp  index there is much talk about return today but few investors seem very concerned about risk this is where your fund shines based on our estimations the median pe ratio for the companies owned in your fund is x this is a  discount from x the median pe for sp  index based on expected earnings for  your fund owns many good businesses and most sell at a bargain price all share strong financial promise while there may be some disappointments along the way we assure you that we will keep our focus on our niche  understandable highly profitable businesses managed by extraordinarily able people eventually we believe the investment pendulum will swing in our favor and reward you handsomely we
