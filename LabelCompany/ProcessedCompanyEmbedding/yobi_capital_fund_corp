is the world’s first digital finance company crowdfunded by the general public we underwrite loans and leases originated and managed fully online our go to market strategy is to innovate new financing solutions that could yield a competitive advantage in the marketplaceyobi fund is like a digital ge capital we are launching a portfolio of websites financing various assetbased transactions across distinct lines of business it is our strategic intent to disrupt and transform the alternative and peertopeer finance industrieseach line of business has its own credit analysts and risk management teams for sourcing vetting and approving customer transactions to be crowdfunded on the parent company yobifundcomthe standard revenue model across all the lines of business is charging loan origination fees and earning a spread between the crowdfunding cost of capital and the market financing rates charged to borrowersas the first crowdfunding finance platform allowing investments from the general public we believe yobi fund will garner significant branding and market recognition this distinction should play a pivotal role as we gain momentum in the rapidly growing crowdfunding marketplace strengthening our competitive advantage we have acquired an exclusive worldwide license to two pending patents“a system for buying and selling securities over a distributed communications network” and “a method and system for activeparticipation in an investormanaged corporation”our patentpending technology is a novel system for ensuring no investment bid violates sometimes conflicting and overlapping federal or state securities regulations these patents could prove invaluable as other crowdfunding competitors attempt to enter our space our financing technology platform is key and instrumental to our success in rapidly deploying a vast portfolio of financing lines of business across many customer segmentsour micro product focused approach allows us to target customers more precisely build tremendous brand value by niche and allows us to generate precise content for search engine optimizationmany of our lines of business share the same technological requirements as such we have designed a common financing management architecture and technological framework that can be easily plugged and played across each line of businessthis allows for significant reduction in our go to market timeline once we identify a new market niche to serve we will have the ability to provision and deploy a fully functional web presence for that financing line of business in less than  dayswe designed our finance technology platform for ubiquity and scale we can easily handle the processing of over  credit applications per daythere are  distinct ways to invest in yobi fund you can

a specific customer transaction sourced from one of our subsidiary websites    terrorism is a global social epidemic terrorist attacks claim the lives of thousands of innocent people every year and cause catastrophic and massive economic damage the continued threat of terrorism is having a crippling psychological effect on our societyaccording to the national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism in  a total of  terrorist attacks occurred worldwide resulting in more than  deaths and more than  injuries spanning across  different countries this equates to an average of  terrorist attacks per month the primary targets of terrorist attacks are citizens and private propertyglobal terrorism has caused a surge in the manufacturing and selling of antiterrorism military equipment capable of detecting and defusing bombs a surge has also occurred in the need of protective gear and equipment for nurses doctors and relief workers putting themselves in harm’s way on rescue missions to care for wounded victims of terrornonetheless governments municipalities and private enterprises often lack the financing to deploy antiterrorism equipment and protective gear traditional finance companies categorize antiterrorism equipment as mobile and difficult to confiscate when necessaryfor instance relief organizations such as the international federation of red cross has had to delay cancel or terminate humanitarian missions in war torn or natural disaster areas due in part to a lack of access to antiterrorism protective equipment that would enable workers to conduct their missions safely mainteracom a domain name operated by yobi leasing a subsidiary line of business of yobi fund solves these problems and makes protective antiterrorism military equipment easily accessible and affordable to both governments and commercial enterprisesmainteracom is establishing relationships with a global network of antiterrorism military original equipment manufacturers oems to finance customer orders for this equipment through their network of dealers and distributorsmainteracom will fund these deals by selling fixed income debt securities to an online network of both accredited and unaccredited investors in a crowdfunding business modelwe will seek celebrity endorsers to promote yobi fund through social media assets by encouraging their fans and the general public to save lives and prevent more terrorist attacks by investing in yobi fundan american company with a headquarters or plant oversees wants to protect their employees from potential bomb attacks due to the perceived credit risk of leasing mobile military equipment the company is unable to secure financing for this equipment from traditional financing sources mainteracom can finance this deal    according to the equipment leasing and finance foundation in  investments in equipment and software grew to  billion global original equipment manufacturers oems utilize both inhouse sales teams and independent networks of dealers to sell their productsthe highly fragmented independent dealer networks account for billions of dollars in revenue and is our initial target channel partners for deal flowlandmontcom a domain name operated by yobi leasing a subsidiary of yobi fund will compete with oem financing programs with a more competitive price point and with a significantly enhanced dealer and customer ebusiness solution experiencemost secondary financing requires a borrower to signoff on installed equipment before the financing company releases funds to the dealer for large purchases dealers may not have the cash flow to float the advance purchase as such on larger financing transactions dealers are generally constrained to use oem financing at higher rateswe believe this inefficiency creates a multibillion dollar sales opportunity in the marketplace landmontcom plans to prepurchase equipment from dealers with a high quality credit and service performance historywe anticipate pricing dealer rate cards at a discount to their existing oem rate cards such that the dealer could gain additional profits of at least  per million in leased salesleasing companies are very lowtech very few have websites and only a small fraction have online servicing capabilities we believe our fullservice web portals should establish landmontcom as a leader in the space we will process and service all dealer and customer credit applications via our web portallandmontcom has already made significant progress in developing momentum with over  active equipment dealers we anticipate financing over  million in equipment leases after our first year of onboarding the current list of dealers with expressed interest in our leasing programlandmontcom will fund these deals by selling fixed income debt securities to an online network of both accredited and general public investors in a crowdfunding business modela dealer secures a large equipment order from a direct customer but does not have the working capital to prepurchase the equipment from the oem he turns to landmontcom for financing    according to redfin residential house flipping in the us is a  billion industry with  homes flipped in  with an average investment of  and an average gross profit of we define a house flip as a house purchased and sold within one calendar year there are tens of thousands of house flippers within the us alone these real estate investors initially purchase fix and flip properties with their own cash or with their local bank line of credit when these sources of capital run dry they seek alternative sources of financinga highly fragmented network of high net worth individuals invest or loan money to house flippers these private investors generally post listings on classified online directories such as craigslist there exist a huge opportunity for consolidating these private real estate investors and to establishing a wellknown brand for offering alternative financing for the real estate house flipping industrykeepflippingcom a domain name operated by yobi homes a subsidiary line of business of yobi fund will establish a brand for alternative real estate financing for the highly fragmented house flipping industrykeepflippingcom will efficiently source capital from a network of both accredited and general public investors and will optimally deploy this capital to fund profitable house flipping opportunities where both the investors and the house flippers can earn a great return on the investmentunlike traditional banks and finance companies we do not rely on traditional credit and financial profiling as the basis for approving or rejecting fixandflip dealsspecifically we will source and deploy capital more efficiently by adopting an opportunity score ™ system our opportunity score ™ system uses big data analytics to determine an investment risk assessmentfor the house flipping industry the opportunity score™ system considers various deal metrics including information about the neighborhood of the investment property square footage of the property fair market appraisal of improved and similar sized properties within the same neighborhood and the average number of days it takes to sell a comparable house in that particular neighborhoodkeepflippingcom will fund these deals by selling fixed income debt securities to an online network of both accredited and general public investors in a crowdfunding business modela real estate investor has exhausted his personal finances and his line of credit with his local bank if he had access to additional capital he would flip more properties he turns to keepflippingcom for financing    we received a  million infusion at a  million premoney valuation to
