and smoky and towels from when we gave our dog a bath when he was muddy they come back spotless  smelling great every time got to try this service out for free through eatworkplay charlotte and i love it customer service is very prompt when answering questions shoutout to charlie for being so patient with me because i had a lot of questions day one they let you know whats going on every in every
