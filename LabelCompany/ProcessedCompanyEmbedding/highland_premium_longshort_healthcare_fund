are not made “againstthebox” as defined under “description of principal investments” theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase hedging risk although intended to limit or reduce investment risk hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit there is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful market risk the fund’s share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of its portfolio securities many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the fund portfolio turnover risk high portfolio turnover will increase the fund’s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net shortterm capital gains derivatives risk derivatives are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index derivatives also expose the fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty leverage risk leverage may increase the risk of loss cause fluctuations in the market value of the fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the net asset value

greater risk than securities with higher ratings such securities are regarded by the rating organizations as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation derivatives risk derivatives are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index derivatives also expose the fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty equity securities risk equity securities such as common stocks are subject to market economic and business risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate industry concentration risk because the fund normally invests at least  of the value of its assets in healthcare companies the fund’s performance largely depends on the overall condition of the healthcare industry and the fund is susceptible to economic political and regulatory risks or other occurrences associated with the healthcare industry leverage risk leverage may increase the risk of loss cause fluctuations in the market value of the fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the nav of the fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise micro small and midcap securities risk investments in securities of companies with micro small or medium capitalizations involve certain risks that may differ from or be greater than those for larger companies such as higher volatility lower trading volume fewer business lines and lack of public information nonus securities risk investments in securities of nonus issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments for example expropriation or political or economic instability portfolio turnover risk high portfolio turnover will increase the fund’s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net shortterm capital gains higher taxable distributions and lower aftertax performance short sales risk short sales that are not made “againstthebox” as defined under “description of principal investments” theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase
