value for shareholders overall it was a very positive quarter exhibited through improved gross margins a stronger cash balance and significant operational progress in both the aquaculture and the cattlebeef businesses “to recap our highlevel strategy we are undertaking a series of initiatives to transition sino agro food into an investment vehicle with positions in multiple independent public companies operating within china’s agricultural industry to this end sino agro food’s two largest and fast growing subsidiaries – the aquaculture and beef businesses – will be carved out from the parent company and listed on stock exchanges where we believe their shares will be able to trade at a market value commensurate with peers and substantially higher than their embedded values as part of this carve out and ipo process we are raising growth capital for these subsidiaries to accelerate their development with sino agro food expected to retain significant stakes in each of the companies after the spin offs have occurred“one key focus right now is our aquaculture business which we believe has the potential to develop into an extremely profitable and sustainable business model of much larger size through its proprietary indoor recirculating aquaculture systems “ras” technology the aquaculture business produces diseasefree superior quality and highermargin seafood to the china markets all yearround with aquaculture the fastest growing food production system in the world and currently accounting for nearly  of world seafood supply we are confident that our superior production methods position the aquaculture subsidiary as a competitive and significant player in a rapidly growing market“by transferring all the assets from our whollyowned subsidiary capital awards into a standalone entity we expect to attract institutional investors who specialize in investing in highgrowth business opportunities spurring higher valuations for the “new” entities as well as siaf we strongly believe this strategy is the most efficient way to enable the aquaculture business to grow rapidly benefiting all shareholders“during the third quarter we took necessary steps to commence work at the aquafarms this has curtailed production in the short term but is expected to expand capacity and therefore revenues as early as q  the company was able to secure  million in working capital to facilitate these efforts while continuing to work closely with a major asian bank toward securing a larger loan to accelerate the growth of the company the larger loan is taking longer to complete since the prospective lender is agreeing to help underwrite the ipo as well thus while the overall review and approval process for the “entire package” consumes more time it also provides the company’s shareholders a much greater return on investment than would other available alternatives at this time in the interim we will continue to develop the aquaculture farms organically via internally generated cash flow with our plan to develop the world’s largest ras farm we are confident the aquaculture business can grow into a highly profitable company driven by demand from the burgeoning middle classes in china“sjap our cattle and beef subsidiary is also undergoing several strategic changes to maximize its value specifically we are restructuring the business with the goal of listing it on a stock exchange in early  as with the aquaculture business the carveout will make it easier to more accurately value the company and is expected to attract more investors at a higher valuation“sjap is transitioning toward production of higher quality beef which as well as generating improved margins for the company allows us to tap into an underserved niche currently there is limited supply of premium quality beef in china and products on the market are typically imported from abroad however as chinese consumers become wealthier and more discerning about food quality the consumption of premium beef is expected to grow significantly sino agro food is one of the foremost players in this market and our leadership position in the industry provides an advantage going forward during the quarter we continued to transition toward premium cattle breeds coupled with higher prices for domestic beef the transition led to a marked improvement in gross marginsin the short term our cash flow is constrained by ongoing investments in these business segments yet results from our strategy have already begun to materialize as obscure as it may seem the company is reaching an inflection point in its growth trajectory and reiterates its appreciation to shareholders who remain confident in the company’s mission going forward”earnings call informationthe company will host an

entity of sufficient scale and potential to attract ipo interest at valuations rewarding to the company’s shareholders “these activities were followed by the completion of the carveout of the aquaculture operations contributing to strong overall financial results in  and setting the stage for further growth and value recognition in  we recorded a deemed gain on sale of m and hold a certified fair value of m in the new entity at the time of the carveout the new organization for the aquaculture business will support accelerated growth as it is better suited for infusions of working and development capital at what we expect to be more favorable valuations we have long believed that our assets are undervalued and that our organizational structure limited our opportunities to convert existing and planned development to business advantage completing the carveout was a significant milestone toward unleashing this value we expect significant accretion to siaf earnings per
