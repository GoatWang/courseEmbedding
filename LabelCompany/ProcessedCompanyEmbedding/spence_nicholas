arrival in the colony spencer secured an appointment as a customs collector in addition to his post as the administrator of his cousins virginia estates spencers job as agent for his colepeper cousins included such prosaic tasks as seizing winter beaver skins or casks of tobacco for debts owed the colepeper interests spencer and john washington jointly held the post of customs collector on the potomac after washingtons death in  spencer was sole customs collector on the potomac he also won his own land grant but spencer was unlikely as it sounds apparently an efficient administrator on his own later being appointed to additional posts in virginia by virtue of his abilities thomas colepeper nd baron colepeper cousin for whom nicholas spencer acted as agent spencer was apparently a pragmatic administrator he was also a hardnosed capitalist when it came to slavery for instance spencer weighed the benefits of enslaved labor in a strictly costbenefit way the low price of tobacco spencer wrote requires it should bee made as cheap as possible and that blacks can make it cheaper than whites spencers rationale for slavery was probably as succinctly heartless as any committed to paper spencers role as an aristocratic bureaucrat in the new colony was a tricky one he was navigating the shoals of dilemmas which have perplexed a nation for centuries while simultaneously attempting to rationalize slavery spencer was also writing to the privy council in england about the virginia colonys precarious place on the edge of catholic maryland unruly and unorderly spirits lay hold of ye motion of affairs spencer wrote and that under the pretext of religion soe as from those false glasses to pretend to betake themselves to arms from the groundless imaginacon sic that the few papists in maryland and virginia had conspired to hyre the seneca indians to ye cutting off and totall distroying of all ye protestants at the same time the forces that were propelling the virginia colony into the forefront of american economic and social might – primarily the raising of tobacco based on slavery – were simultaneously making spencers administrative role tricky the virginia colony of the era was as the eminent colonial historian edmund s morgan wrote the volatile society there were popular uprisings such as bacons rebellion as well as the tobacco plantcutting riots a communication to the crown in  noted that his opposition to the bacon rebellion for instance had taken a toll on spencers estates having done the country very good service against the rebells in that hee affected part of the country where he resided and as wee are credibly informed by his correspondence here is much impaired in his estate by the late rebells in  spencer wrote to london in the wake of the events roiling virginia bacons rebellion spencer told colonial overseers in london had left an itching behind it it was plaine that the class tensions stirred by the rebellion had lingered with a mutinous mob subsequently engaged in wild and extravagant rioting going from farm to farm tearing tobacco plants out by their roots the virginia government reacted harshly with militia patrols and the promise of steep fines the frenzy according to spencer destroyed crops on over  plantations and was driven by a glutted tobacco market which had depressed prices even the wives spencer wrote took up hoes laid down by their husbands and continued to rip out the plants such civil disobedience nicholas spencer saw was the price paid by colonial administrators acting the foil for the empires merchants back home for an aristocratic englishman accustomed to centuriesold protocol the mix must have been dizzying one can almost sense spencers wish for some good oldfashioned english authority when taken with symptoms of illness he wrote to his brother in england outlining his pains asking him to consult an english doctor and send him the diagnosis as quickly as possible nor was spencers role as his colepeper cousins agent an easy job as landlords of an almostfeudal domain eventually encompassing over five million acres  km² in the new colony the colepeper northern neck grant eventually passed on to their fairfax heirs came to be seen by some colonists as an onerous reminder of english aristocratic privilege in colepepers absence it fell to their relation spencer to do the heavylifting of collecting rents and taxes on the colepeper barony survey of the land grant at little hunting creek to col nicholas spencer and lt col john washington site of todays mount vernon estate  in the meantime spencer married frances the daughter of col john mottrom of coan hall of northumberland county virginia mottrom was likely the first white settler of the northern neck in the early seventeenth century he later served as the first burgess for northumberland in  and presided over the county court for four years mottroms daughter and her husband nicholas spencer named one of their sons mottrom after john mottrom another spencer son william returned to england for schooling and remained there serving as a whig member of parliament for bedfordshire william spencer the son of the virginia emigrant nicholas married lady catherine wentworth daughter of thomas wentworth st earl of cleveland following the early death of william his brother nicholas jr returned to england to succeed to the family estates nicholas spencer was prominent in the affairs of the virginia colony residing at his plantation on nomini creek westmoreland countys cople parish the anglican parish which embraced half the county was renamed in  to honor spencer and his english birthplace at cople the spencer family were connected to the washington family in england and later in virginia col spencer patented the acre  km land grant at mount vernon with his friend lt col john washington in  with spencer acting as the gobetween in the sale the successful patent on the acreage was due largely to spencer who acted as agent for his cousin thomas colepeper nd baron colepeper who controlled the northern neck of virginia in which the tract lay spencers business interests and later lifeedit when john washington died in  his son lawrence george washingtons grandfather inherited his fathers stake in the mount vernon property following col nicholas spencers death the washingtons and the spencers divided the land grant with the spencer heirs taking the larger southern half of the mount vernon grant bordering dogue creek and the washingtons the portion along little hunting creek the spencer heirs paid lawrence washington  pounds of tobacco as compensation for their choice later the washingtons bought out the spencer interest at mount vernon aside from acting as agent for the colepeper interests spencer was frequently involved in virginia colony business and he often corresponded with english administrators in london as well as family members in bedfordshire and elsewhere when his cousin thomas colepeper departed virginia in  spencer was named acting governor in which capacity he served for nine months until the april  arrival of francis howard th baron howard of effingham because of the early deaths of his brothers spencer was the only surviving son of his father nicholas and so inherited extensive family estates in bedfordshire and huntingdonshire spencer also was left land by other early prominent settlers in westmoreland county in a deposition of  by lt col john washington for instance who was related to the pope family of popes creek washington testified that in his will of  june  washingtons kinsman richard cole had left all his virginia lands to nicholas spencer washington declareth that hee hath heard mr richard cole deceased declare that hee had made a will and given his whole estate to younge mr nicholas spencer and further saith not the controversial richard cole had also specified that his body be buried on his plantation in a black walnut coffin with a gravestone of english black marble to be imported for the purpose and a tombstone whose epitaph read heere lies dick cole a grievous sinner that died a

way the low price of tobacco spencer wrote requires it should bee made as cheap as possible and that blacks can make it cheaper than whites spencers rationale for slavery was probably as succinctly heartless as any committed to paper spencers role as an aristocratic bureaucrat in the new colony was a tricky one he was navigating the shoals of dilemmas which have perplexed a nation for centuries while simultaneously attempting to rationalize slavery spencer was also writing to the privy council in england about the virginia colonys precarious place on the edge of catholic maryland unruly and unorderly spirits lay hold of ye motion of affairs spencer wrote and that under the pretext of religion soe as from those false glasses to pretend to betake themselves to arms from the groundless imaginacon sic that the few papists in maryland and virginia had conspired to hyre the seneca indians to ye cutting off and totall distroying of all ye protestants at the same time the forces that were propelling the virginia colony into the forefront of american economic and social might – primarily the raising of tobacco based on slavery – were simultaneously making spencers administrative role tricky the virginia colony of the era was as the eminent colonial historian edmund s morgan wrote the volatile society there were popular uprisings such as bacons rebellion as well as the tobacco plantcutting riots a communication to the crown in  noted that his opposition to the bacon rebellion for instance had taken a toll on spencers estates having done the country very good service against the rebells in that hee affected part of the country where he resided and as wee are credibly informed by his correspondence here is much impaired in his estate by the late rebells in  spencer wrote to london in the wake of the events roiling virginia bacons rebellion spencer told colonial overseers in london had left an itching behind it it was plaine that the class tensions stirred by the rebellion had lingered with a mutinous mob subsequently engaged in wild and extravagant rioting going from farm to farm tearing tobacco plants out by their roots the virginia government reacted harshly with militia patrols and the promise of steep fines the frenzy according to spencer destroyed crops on over  plantations and was driven by a glutted tobacco market which had depressed prices even the wives spencer wrote took up hoes laid down by their husbands and continued to rip out the plants such civil disobedience nicholas spencer saw was the price paid by colonial administrators acting the foil for the empires merchants back home for an aristocratic englishman accustomed to centuriesold protocol the mix must have been dizzying one can almost sense spencers wish for some good oldfashioned english authority when taken with symptoms of illness he wrote to his brother in england outlining his pains asking him to consult an english doctor and send him the diagnosis as quickly as possible nor was spencers role as his colepeper cousins agent an easy job as landlords of an almostfeudal domain eventually encompassing over five million acres  km² in the new colony the colepeper northern neck grant eventually passed on to their fairfax heirs came to be seen by some colonists as an onerous reminder of english aristocratic privilege in colepepers absence it fell to their relation spencer to do the heavylifting of collecting rents and taxes on the colepeper barony survey of the land grant at little hunting creek to col nicholas spencer and lt col john washington site of todays mount vernon estate  in the meantime spencer married frances the daughter of col john mottrom of coan hall of northumberland county virginia mottrom was likely the first white settler of the northern neck in the early seventeenth century he later served as the first burgess for northumberland in  and presided over the county court for four years mottroms daughter and her husband nicholas spencer named one of their sons mottrom after john mottrom another spencer son william returned to england for schooling and remained there serving as a whig member of parliament for bedfordshire william spencer the son of the virginia emigrant nicholas married lady catherine wentworth daughter of thomas wentworth st earl of cleveland following the early death of william his brother nicholas jr returned to england to succeed to the family estates nicholas spencer was prominent in the affairs of the virginia colony residing at his plantation on nomini creek westmoreland countys cople parish the anglican parish which embraced half the county was renamed in  to honor spencer and his english birthplace at cople the spencer family were connected to the washington family in england and later in virginia col spencer patented the acre  km land grant at mount vernon with his friend lt col john washington in  with spencer acting as the gobetween in the sale the successful patent on the acreage was due largely to spencer who acted as agent for his cousin thomas colepeper nd baron colepeper who controlled the northern neck of virginia in which the tract lay spencers business interests and later lifeedit when john washington died in  his son lawrence george washingtons grandfather inherited his fathers stake in the mount vernon property following col nicholas spencers death the washingtons and the spencers divided the land grant with the spencer heirs taking the larger southern half of the mount vernon grant bordering dogue creek and the washingtons the portion along little hunting creek the spencer heirs paid lawrence washington  pounds of tobacco as compensation for their choice later the washingtons bought out the spencer interest at mount vernon aside from acting as agent for the colepeper interests spencer was frequently involved in virginia colony business and he often corresponded with english administrators in london as well as family members in bedfordshire and elsewhere when his cousin thomas colepeper departed virginia in  spencer was named acting governor in which capacity he served for nine months until the april  arrival of francis howard th baron howard of effingham because of the early deaths of his brothers spencer was the only surviving son of his father nicholas and so inherited extensive family estates in bedfordshire and huntingdonshire spencer also was left land by other early prominent settlers in westmoreland county in a deposition of  by lt col john washington for instance who was related to the pope family of popes creek washington testified that in his will of  june  washingtons kinsman richard cole had left all his virginia lands to nicholas spencer washington declareth that hee hath heard mr richard cole deceased declare that hee had made a will and given his whole estate to younge mr nicholas spencer and further saith not the controversial richard cole had also specified that his body be buried on his plantation in a black walnut coffin with a gravestone of english black marble to be imported for the purpose and a tombstone whose epitaph read heere lies dick cole a grievous sinner that died a
