main contentskip to related contentpimco launches global tips etf eric dutram zacksmay  reblogsharetweetsharejust two months after pimco’s incredible success with the total return etf bond it looks as though the californiabased bond management giant is back at it again with another new fund this time pimco looks to help investors better manage inflation expectations in the fixed income world via its global advantage inflationlinked bond strategy fund ilbthis product is an activelymanaged etf that primarily consists of highquality inflation linked bonds that span across developed and emerging markets investors should also note that the product will not and cannot use options futures or swaps in its strategy while expenses look to come in at  a year after waiverstips in focusgenerally speaking bonds included in this fund are tied to the cpi of a particular region or nation and look to provide a degree of protection against inflation this is done by increasing or decreasing the face value of the bond based on observed changes in cpi and then paying out a real rate of return based on this figure to investors read is the bear market for bond etfs finally herein the case of us tips this process is done twice a year and bonds are not permitted to fall below their par value level thanks to this deflation isn’t very much of a problem for tips especially if prices are already close to the levels they were at when the bonds were first issuedthe main downside to this approach is that investors often have to accept a lower yield in order to obtain the inflation protection the securities are backed by the government and have virtually no credit or inflation risk unlike many other bond securities so while you will be wellinsulated from many risks investors seeking high levels of current income could be disappointed also read are the fundamental bond etfs better fixed income picksilb’s unique approachunlike many etfs in the tips segment ilb has a broad focus which includes both american and international inflationprotected sovereign bonds as such it can act as a global barometer for the space holding both developed and emerging inflationlinked bonds furthermore most of the products in the tips etf world are passively managed making ilb’s active approach relatively uniquethis strategy is also based on pimco’s ability to apply their views on individual countries and their inflation expectations and currency situations to the tips market additionally the team also takes a special look at maturity and duration positioning in order to achieve a nice balance between risk and reward see three outperforming active etfsit should also be noted that the product is also going to put itself up against a gdpbased secondary benchmark for inflation linked bonds this index looks to focus on economies that are driving global growth rather than maintain exposure to market capweighted more traditional systemsnevertheless the approach tilts the fund towards the world’s biggest issuer of treasury securities the united states securities from america constitute over  of the portfolio while australia mexico brazil and the uk round out the rest of the top five see more in the zacks etf centerin total the product holds  securities in its basket and has a relatively short effective duration of just over seven years unfortunately yield data is not available yet due to the newness of the product although similar—but passively managed—funds in the tips market pay out day sec yields around the  marktips etf competitioncurrently there are a number of etfs in the inflationlinked bond space including several from pimco however these are usually focused on the american space although a few companies have launched international inflationlinked bond etfs as well beyond these the only true competition in the space at this time looks to be the global inflationlinked bond fund gtipthis fund tracks the bofa merrill lynch global diversified inflationlinked index which is a benchmark of inflationlinked bonds from around the world currently the product charges just  basis points a year in fees and pays out a robust  yield to investorsin terms of exposure assets are tilted towards american securities although bonds from the uk brazil and france round out the top four the portfolio’s breakdown for duration is also skewed towards the middle of the curve the weighted average maturity is about  years with the majority of bonds coming due from  years from now also read pimco total return etf launcheshowever investors should note that the product has failed to amass a great deal in assets as it still has less than  million in aum yet with that being said pimco’s new total return fund has seen a great deal of interest as have many of the firms other tipsfocused productsas a result the company may be able to with its unique methodology buck the trend in this global inflationlinked bond space and accumulate a robust amount of assets although only time will tell with this brand new bond etf  want the latest recommendations from zacks investment research today you can download  best stocks for the next  days click to get

the expansion of pimco’s range of actively managed etfs which marry pimco’s experience managing global fixed income investments with the tradability of an etf vehicle providing investors intraday pricing and daily portfolio disclosures in a single share class with globalisation exposing investors to price pressures and growth patterns of countries around the world pimco believes that investors need to consider a fuller set of inflationoriented investments rather than solely the investor’s domestic market by exploiting a wider global selection of inflationlinked bonds and currencies the fund

rob arnott that possesses demonstrated expertise in asset allocation the investment process evaluates four essential “building blocks” of returns and is complemented by a qualitative fifth step to help ensure a robust outcome potential for longterm real returns each underlying investment is evaluated for its longterm real return potential by assessing its current yield and expected income growth net of inflation potential value added by pimco since each underlying investment is actively managed by pimco an adjustment is made to the return estimate for that asset class based on the consistency and level of excess return that the respective pimco portfolio manager has historically delivered potential for valuation change key valuation metrics are evaluated for each underlying investment in order to assess absolute and relative value the likelihood of a valuation change and to what extent that alters the nearterm return potential for that investment impact from economic and technical factors additional inputs are considered to refine return and risk forecasts such as the current stage of the business cycle the transition probability to the next stage and where relevant select technical indicators such as lead lag momentum or mean reversion factors subjective considerations experts at pimco and research affiliates possess a wide depth and breadth of experience across various global asset classes formally once a month and informally as required key personnel at both firms engage in substantive dialogue to identify any factors that might have been missed by the quantitative process and if those warrant a modest subjective adjustment to the modeldriven allocations ​sources of added value ​investors seek high real returns in order to meet their return goals hedge inflation risk and grow the purchasing power of their savings going forward this level of real returns may not be achieved by conventional allocations centered on mainstream stocks and bonds

stocks and bonds so that investors can access a wider range of returngenerating and inflationhedging sectors second it incorporates the potential for excess returns alpha above passive indexes in each underlying strategy through pimco’s active management expertise third it incorporates the tactical asset allocation decisions of research affiliates which uses a demonstrated disciplined process aimed at both enhancing returns and mitigating risk by changing the mix of underlying strategies over time ​about the subadviser ​pimco’s all asset strategies are subadvised by research affiliates llc an

indices global advantage bond index key documents fine specifications pdf overview introductionthe pimco global advantage bond index gladi is an innovative investment grade multisector fixed income benchmark launched in january  gladi is designed to better capture investment opportunities in a rapidly changing world intended to offer investors an improved benchmark for fixed income market “beta” gladi provides a building block for portfolios with the potential for higher riskadjusted returns view historical data view index constituents view current snapshot view weights please wait overview methodology index attributes comparative statistics a more thoughtful approach to bond indexing the global economy is in the midst of dramatic transformations that challenge the ability of traditional investment approaches to generate sustainable returns while also managing risks one profound change crucial to bond investing is the explosion of public debt levels in industrialized countries traditional bond indexes – by virtue of their market capitalizationweighting methodology – have an inherent structural bias to overweight countries with high levels of debt as concerns about sovereign creditworthiness have become increasingly critical to asset allocation there has been greater urgency for an alternative to traditional approaches through its broader coverage and unique construction methodology gladi explicitly recognizes the need for investors to position their fixed income portfolios within this changing global environment several core features distinguish gladi from traditional fixed income indices including an innovative gdpweighting methodology that is designed to avoid the disadvantages of traditional indexes based solely on market capitalization weighting a continuum in coverage from developed to emerging markets capturing the fuller set of global investment grade opportunities and avoiding a lopsided weighting toward developed markets inclusion of inflationlinked bonds in addition to nominal bonds providing a partial builtin hedge against potential inflationary pressures a global beta that evolves with the world’s economic structure providing broad exposure to a diversified basket of global currencies especially currencies of creditor countries in the emerging world advantages of gdp weighting gladi weights index components based on gross domestic product gdp as an alternative to the market capitalization weights used by most existing fixed income indexes gdp weighting offers a number of relative potential benefits  higher allocation to lowdebt countriesbecause larger stocks of debt mean higher market capitalization market capitalizationweighted indexes are at a structural disadvantage as they have a bias to assign greater weights to highly indebted countries even though the credit quality of those issuers may be eventually compromised by their debt loadin contrast gladi’s gdpweighted approach bases allocation on national income gdp which embodies the capacity to repay debt the incomeoriented approach produces a bond beta with an emphasis on countries with lower leverage or lower levels of debt relative to their ability to service the debt as illustrated in figure     forwardlookingfundamental transformations in global capital markets are reshaping the financial landscape for retail and institutional investors market capitalizationweighted indexes fail to capture these changes because they are inherently backwardlooking reflecting past patterns of debt issuance since rapid economic growth tends to precede the liberalization and deepening of capital markets gladi’s gdp weighting is designed to capture the opportunities that exist in the world’s most dynamic economies by embedding a concept of where capital markets will be in the future – rather than where they have been in the past – gladi helps investors position their portfolios to reap potential firstmover benefits  countercyclical rebalancinganother wellknown disadvantage of market capitalizationweighted indexes is that they assign progressively greater weight to securities as they go up in price exactly the opposite of the investment maxim to “buy low sell high” gladi not only is designed to avoid this pitfall of market capitalization weighting but also has the potential to benefit from countercyclical rebalancing since bond prices tend to move inversely to gdp growth over the business cycle with bond prices rising as economic growth slows and falling as economic growth accelerates a gdpweighted index that increases the relative weight of countries in the expansion phase of the business cycle when bond prices are low and reduces the relative weight of countries in the contraction phase when bond prices are high helps embed a “buy low sell high” bias as illustrated in figure  ​​ the pimco global advantage bond index gladi is a diversified global index that covers a wide spectrum of global fixed income opportunities and sectors from developed to emerging markets nominal to real assets and cash to derivative instruments unlike traditional indices which are frequently comprised of bonds weighted according to their market capitalization gladi uses gdpweighting which puts an emphasis on fastergrowing areas of the world and thus makes the index forwardlooking in nature pimco�s gladi methodology

policy   methodology the construction of gladi follows three steps  regional weights are assigned based upon the relative gdp shares of the respective major regions in the global economy  factorinstrument category weights are identified based upon the primary sources of fixed income riskreturn available to global investors within each region and  security selection within each subindex is guided by a set of rules and a market profile process designed to ensure that the index is investable and can be replicated in a portfolio of liquid securities figure  illustrates the process figure  three steps in constructing gladi step  assign regional weights by gross domestic product major regions weighted by share of global gdp united states eurozone japan other industrialized countries emerging markets step  assign instrument category weight by key sources of fixed income risk and return balance of instruments to represent key sources of fixed income return interest rate duration interest rate swaps nominal inflationprotected securities real credit premiums investment grade corporate bonds external sovereign bonds securitized instrument premiums mortgagebacked securities and covered bonds step  complete security selection for each subindex based upon eligibility criteria and market profile security selection designed for replicability and investibility eligibility criteria credit quality instrument type minimum remaining maturity minimum par outstanding market profile process select set of liquid securities to represent maturity and industry profile of broader market step  regional weights the regional classification distinguishes the major economic regions listed in figure  with the weight of each region in gladi determined by its respective share of global gdp gdp shares are calculated as the simple average of each region’s share of global gdp for the previous five years measured in nominal us dollars at market exchange rates the gdp data come from the international monetary fund gdp weights are revised annually with the new weights becoming effective on  october of each year figure  displays the current regional target weights for gladi based on the annual review that became effective on  october    step  instruments weights and subindex target weights as discussed above market capitalization weighting has the disadvantage of increasing the weight of securities as they become more expensive in addition market capitalizationweighted global indexes tend to be dominated by government bonds because of their large historical issuance despite the fact that many bond managers tend to use other instruments such as interest rate swaps as a substitute for the interest rate duration that comes from government securities to avoid these issues gladi takes a different approach employing a proportional weighting system based on the key sources of fixed income risk and return of particular importance are  interest rate duration reflecting the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in nominal and real yields  credit premiums reflecting the higher yields available on securities with credit risk and  securitized instrument premiums reflecting embedded prepayment options and other premiums associated with mortgagebacked securities in the absence of a robust theoretical or empirical rationale for departing from a parsimonious equal weighting of each of these factors this is adopted as the preferred weighting scheme the implementation of steps  and  is illustrated in figure  where each respective region’s gdp weight column a is multiplied by the proportional instrument category weight column b to produce the  subindex target weightscolumn c for the united states the eurozone and other industrialized countries the application of this framework is straightforward the  interest rate duration component is represented by a mix of two parts interest rate swaps and one part inflationprotected securities the  credit premium component is represented by fixedrate corporate bonds and the  securitized instrument premium component is represented by us agency mortgagebacked security tbas mortgagebacked bonds in canada and denmark and covered bonds and pfandbriefe in the eurozone sweden switzerland and the united kingdom in other markets adjustments to this methodology are incorporated to reflect the availability of certain categories of instruments for japan where liquidity in the corporate bond market is highly limited and there is no substantial securitized market only the interest rate duration component is included for emerging markets the lack of liquid interest rate swap markets means that internal local currencydenominated government bonds are used to represent the interest rate duration risk factor while us dollar and eurodenominated external sovereign bonds are used to represent credit premiums due to the lack of widespread securitized markets at this time this category is not represented for emerging markets however because shortduration local currency investments have become a staple of global investment in these markets currency – represented by shortdated foreign exchange derivatives – is included as a separate category   step  security selection the final step is to determine the specific securities that will be included in each of the subindexes the universe of potential securities is defined by a series of eligibility criteria in order to preserve replicability and investability the number of securities selected within each market is limited depending on the size of the market and liquidity considerations when the actual number of securities in the market exceeds the limit a market profile process is applied to select the securities that will be included in the index the market profile process refines the universe of eligible securities to identify the most representative and liquid securities producing an index that is replicable and investable a eligibility criteria credit quality eligible instruments must be investment grade bbb or higher the average rating from moody’s sp and fitch is considered when available instruments downgraded to below investment grade are removed from the index upon monthly reconstitution instrument type outside of derivatives instruments only fixedrate noncallable except for mortgagebacked securities bullet bonds or sinking funds issued by developed and emerging governments corporations and securitization entities are eligible remaining maturity all emerging market inflation protected corporate and securitized bonds must have at least  months remaining until maturity securities with maturities of less than  months upon monthly reconstitution are excluded from the index minimum par amount outstanding eligible instruments must have a current par amount outstanding greater than or equal to a minimum amount that differs by instrument and is currency specific minimum par for inflationprotected bonds is  billion usd or the approximate foreign currency equivalent for corporate bonds the minimum is  million usd  million gbp or  million cad eur aud or chf securitized bonds must have a minimum par of  billion cad or eur  million gbp  million chf  billion sek or  billion dkk for emerging markets the minimum for external bonds is  million usd or eur while local bonds must have a minimum local currency equivalent of  million usd b market profile the market profile process is used for the corporate securitized and emerging market local bond subindexes of gladi the objective of the process is to create an index that is replicable and investable by identifying the most representative and liquid bonds in each sector of the market the market profile process for each subindex varies depending on the particular attributes of that sector but the basic process involves three steps illustrated in figure  with an example from the us corporates subindex  create a market structure matrix which classifies all bonds according to the most relevant factors in that market  calculate the number of bonds to be selected for the market profile for each cell by multiplying the cell’s market share by the overall target number of bonds for the subindex  select the highestranked individual securities based on a set of ranking criteria – see box inside figure  until the target number of bonds per cell is satisfied only one bond per issuer is considered in each cell until one bond from each issuer represented in that cell has been selected if the number of bonds required is larger than the number of issuers a second bond is selected from each issuer according to the rank until the required number of bonds has been selected streamlined market profiles are also used for the interest rate swap and emerging market foreign exchange components of the index a basket of year year year and year swaps are used to represent the interest rate swap subindexes while a basket of month month and month foreign exchange forwards are used to represent the emerging market currency subindex figure  market profile example us corporates  for us corporates the relevant factors are industry sector and maturity bonds are assigned to cells in the matrix based on their sector senior financial subordinated financial nonfinancial consumer and nonfinancial industrial and maturity band  years  years  years in this example  of the total market value of the us corporate universe is in the cell corresponding to financials with  years maturity  calculate the number of bonds to be selected for the market profile for each cell by multiplying the cell’s market share by the overall target number of bonds for the subindex the overall target number of bonds for the us corporate subindex is  using the example above where financial sector bonds of  year maturity represent  of the universe  bonds should be selected for this cell  x     for this example bonds issued within the last five years would be the first considered for index inclusion with these bonds ranked based on  the amount outstanding  time since issue  remaining time to maturity and  issuer size ​ index attributes the index methodology described above produces an index that is broadly diversified across instruments regions currencies and maturities key attributes of the gladi overall index and subindexes are presented in the accompanying figures figures  through  show index data as of  october        reweighting and rebalancing target regional weights for gladi will be revised in an annual review with the new weights becoming effective on  october of each year under most circumstances yeartoyear changes in the subindex target weights will come only from changes in the regional weights which will shift as relative shares of global gdp shift on occasion the instrument category weights may also be changed at the annual review to reflect the development of new instrument categories and other innovations in global capital markets the actual weights of the gladi subindexes on a daily basis will deviate from their target weights reflecting changes in the prices of the underlying instruments in the index on a quarterly basis  october  january  april  july the gladi will be rebalanced to restore the actual subindex weights to their targeted levels on a monthly basis

funds tips peering under the hood of pimcos real return team part  of a qa with mihir worah head of the firms real return portfolio management team michelle canavan  we guide pimcos thinking on commodities from a to z so we needed to get more resources in commodities so two key seniorlevel additions in commodities one is greg sharenow who joined about two years ago and focuses on energy that being the most important macro commodity and one where we see a lot of opportunity to add alpha for our clients a second additionthis is brand new just started a month agois gillian rutherford she is a grain specialist an agricultural commodity specialist shes a great addition and just a wonderful resource once we have the energy sector covered the two other major sectors in commodities are metals and grains i was actually searching for a metals specialist initially because again that fits into pimcos style because metals have macroeconomic importance so a metals specialist would add alpha to my commodity funds but would also be able to guide pimcos thinking on whats happening in the emerging markets or what metal copper prices are doing for example but through the course of my search what i found was that there werent that many alpha opportunities in the metals markets and all of the traders and portfolio managers i was speaking to in metals i didnt feel they had the right skill set meanwhile weve been very successfully adding a lot of alpha in grains after energy our second biggest active source of alpha in the commodity complex has been the agricultural sector so we started searching for an agricultural commodity specialist and ended up hiring gillian rutherford about a month ago those are the two senior hires we also have two junior additions on the commodity side andrew dewitt and yi chian chang help us with analysis and trade execution and i hope to develop the junior people i hope in a couple of years theyll be strong pimcocaliber portfolio managers too   the teams offerings worah the most noticeable product development has been the launch of the gladi a suite of indexes that concentrates on a countrys gdp rather than its market capitalization or global advantage inflationlinked bond index and suite of products we have the pimco global advantage inflationlinked bond ilb exchangetraded fund in the us and the pimco gis global advantage real return ucits fund but with real interest rates in the united states and the developed markets artificially repressed and expected to stay low we thought longterm inflation hedgingby longterm investors who are looking for bondmarket inflation hedgeswould be well served by having a strategic exposure to emergingmarkets inflationlinked bonds and so we launched the global advantage suite of products last year click here for a table of sample strategies offered by pimcos real return team in commodities we launched the pimco commoditiesplus strategy as a complement to our commodity flagship pimco commodity real return strategy to offer our clients two things the same ideas back both funds but commoditiesplus is much more active in commodity management with a larger tracking error and larger concentration it also offers the possibility of having more pure commodity exposure that is commodities plus enhanced cash as opposed to the commodities plus tips combination of commodity real return often the tips performance significantly adds to or detracts from the commodity performance and you dont get that pure commodity exposure so we launched the commoditiesplus fund  then the final thing which you know we did almost two years ago now is the pimco inflation response multiasset fund which to us was a response to client requests for basically a onestop realreturn product where they would not have to decide they were looking for longterm positive real returns but they didnt want to make the choice between tips commodities reits and so on given pimcos developing assetallocation capabilities we thoughtand weve been right so farthat we could add value by giving clients a onestop inflationhedging solution and thats been getting a lot of traction both from definedcontribution plans as well as from institutional definedbenefit plans so our three big product initiatives have been the global advantage suite of inflationlinked bond funds which includes emerging markets more active management in commodities and then finally the multiasset real return solution  single page shareemail print text size michelle canavan is an analyst with morningstar our products tools advisor
