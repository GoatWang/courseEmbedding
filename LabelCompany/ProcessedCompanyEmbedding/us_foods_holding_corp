and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no

reidmurdoch was a major sponsor of the teenie weenies comic strip john sexton  company began as a retail tea and coffee merchant in chicago illinois in  john sexton soon discovered hotels and restaurants were his biggest customers by  sexton closed his four chicago retail locations to focus on his institutional customers by  sexton began manufacturing private label pickles salad dressings preserves and jellies as well as roasting coffee in downtown chicago in addition sexton established a food testing laboratory to guarantee that his products had a uniform high level of quality he also developed an extensive national institutional sales force in all major metropolitan areas and a catalog mail order grocery business all national orders were shipped via rail or parcel post from sexton’s chicago warehouse chicago deliveries were by sexton horse and wagon fleet and after  sexton electric and diesel truck fleets by  sexton dropped the catalog mail order business and concentrated on the institutional customers throughout the united states in  sexton opened a warehouse and truck fleet in brooklyn new york to support the new york sexton salesforce by  john sexton

foodservice industry in  sexton warehouses and truck fleets were located in atlanta boston chicago cincinnati dallas detroit los angeles new york orlando philadelphia st louis and san francisco with a

had five locations philadelphia pittsburgh washington dc albany new york and richmond va by the time it sold out to consolidated foods in  donald irwin jr president of parke became the first president of monarch institutional foods at that time los angelesbased se rykoff  co was established in  and the mazo and lerch families started their business in northern virginia in  most of these wholesalers tended to specialize selling items to local grocery stores in the early s distributors including mazolerch company began offering frozen foods primarily frozen french fries and orange juice postworld war iiedit foodservice distributors served institutional clients that provided food away from home unlike retail distributors who sold to grocery stores the first distinction between the two groups came about in  with the formation of the association of institutional distributors with fighting going on in korea the federal government reinstituted price controls including a  percent ceiling on food distributors gross profits about a dozen companies met in chicago to respond to that action because it cost more to distribute to their institutional customers than to grocery stores the distributors wanted to be considered separately from grocery wholesalers and to have their ceiling raised to at least  percent they were successful in their lobbying efforts the federal government also helped open up foodservice markets five years earlier in  the us congress passed the national school lunch act suddenly large numbers of schoolchildren were eating cooked meals away from home and school cafeterias became the first institutional mass market one of the few distributors to focus on schools was the pearceyoungangel company pya in the carolinas that same year consolidated foods corp the precursor of sara lee corporation acquired monarch foods by the late s most distributors had added frozen foods to their product lines in  mazolerch held the first food show and was one of the first distributors to offer both customcut meats and beverage dispenser programs the diversification trend continued over the years as foodservice distributors provided disposable items such as paper napkins and tablecloths followed by china and glassware then light and heavy equipment the sedit in  americans spent just  cents of every food dollar for food away from home total distributor sales that year were an estimated  billion and the average institutional distributor had an annual volume of  billion institutional distributor in its first survey of the foodservice distribution industry found that the average order size of respondents was  and the average number of customers was  the survey also found that nearly half of the respondents sold to both grocery and institutional customers in  john sexton  company went public and its shares traded on the over the counter stock market nasdaq with  million in sales and  million in profits the sedit the decade of the s saw the move to broadline multibranch organizations consolidated foods bought the old pearceyoungangel distribution network in  and merged it with its monarch foods subsidiary to form pyamonarch sysco was established in  by combining five independent wholesale grocery companies sysco went public in  with  million in annual sales and shares were traded on the nyse continental coffee company established

sales of  million pyamonarch of greenville sc had sales of  million john sexton  company of chicago il had sales of  million se rykoff  co of los angeles ca was generating  million strictly on the west coast the sedit the distribution industry went through a difficult period during the early s with companies under pressure as a result of inflation and economic slowdown however people still needed to eat and much of the pressure was from competition speakers at national conferences focused on customer service productivity and professional development computers were playing a greater role in the business enabling a distributor to provide customers with information to help control inventory determine menu costs and analyze profitability as distributors became more professional restaurant chains such as marriott and howard johnson folded or reduced their selfdistribution activities and focused on their restaurant operations by  institutional foodservice distribution was a

bought john sexton  company in  for  million from beatrice foods in what was then the largest acquisition in the industry the renamed rykoffsexton took fourth place among foodservice distributors with  million in sales cfs continental inc purchase of publix fruit and produce moved it into third place with sales in the  billion range number one sysco acquired ba railton along with pegler increasing its volume to over  billion meanwhile in greenville south carolina number two pyamonarch bought fleming foodservice of austin texas raising its  sales volume to an estimated  billion by the end of its fiscal year in june  pyamonarch was serving some  foodservice operators and its  distribution centers blanketed  percent of the united states pyamonarch was one of the first distributors to compete as a provider of services as well as products the day of the distributor who merely warehouses delivers and takes orders for products a customer wants is over company management told institutional distribution in a  article pyamonarchs mission statement revealed its goal to be a premier company in every area of operations providing products and services that can enable a customer to run a more efficient and profitable business using the largest computer in the industry pyamonarch phased in a new stateoftheart data processing system totally centralized the system made it possible for headquarters to carry out data processing for each of the  branches whose computers now gathered data the s saw a tremendous change in the eating habits in the united states by  americans were

company began offering frozen foods primarily frozen french fries and orange juice postworld war iiedit foodservice distributors served institutional clients that provided food away from home unlike retail distributors who sold to grocery stores the first distinction between the two groups came about in  with the formation of the association of institutional distributors with fighting going on in korea the federal government reinstituted price controls including a  percent ceiling on food distributors gross profits about a dozen companies met in chicago to respond to that action because it cost more to distribute to their institutional customers than to grocery stores the distributors wanted to be considered separately from grocery wholesalers and to have their ceiling raised to at

company began offering frozen foods primarily frozen french fries and orange juice postworld war iiedit foodservice distributors served institutional clients that provided food away from home unlike retail distributors who sold to grocery stores the first distinction between the two groups came about in  with the formation of the association of institutional distributors with fighting going on in korea the federal government reinstituted price controls including a  percent ceiling on food distributors gross profits about a dozen companies met in chicago to respond to that action because it cost more to distribute to their institutional customers than to grocery stores the distributors wanted to be considered separately from grocery wholesalers and to have their ceiling raised to at least  percent they were successful in their lobbying efforts the federal government also helped open up foodservice markets five years earlier in  the us congress passed the national school lunch act suddenly large numbers of schoolchildren were eating cooked meals away from home and school cafeterias became the first institutional mass market one of the few distributors to focus on schools was the pearceyoungangel company pya in the carolinas that same year consolidated foods corp the precursor of sara lee corporation acquired monarch foods by the late s most distributors had added frozen foods to their product lines in  mazolerch held the first food show and was one of the first distributors to offer both customcut meats and beverage dispenser programs the diversification trend

pressure as a result of inflation and economic slowdown however people still needed to eat and much of the pressure was from competition speakers at national conferences focused on customer service productivity and professional development computers were playing a greater role in the business enabling a distributor to provide customers with information to help control inventory determine menu

economy jp concentrated on building the lowest cost structure in the industry the company invested primarily in improving facilities adding a new  million replacement center between washington dc and
