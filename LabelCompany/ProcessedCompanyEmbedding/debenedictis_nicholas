robert n debenedictis the businessman who has been behind many of new york citys hot spots for gay men since the mids including the wall street sauna the east side club and the west side club once shared a real estate investment with his brother nicholas debenedictis the former head of the pennsylvania department of environmental resources under governor dick thornburgh and currently the ceo of the publiclytraded aqua america the two brothers owned real property  in fort lauderdale fl as a personal investment through  antioch llc  nicholas debenedictis was a manager in the company from  until sometime in  when he divested his interests  according to a financial disclosure by robert as of june   he owed nicholas over  on a note payable  moreover also according to this financial disclosure as of june   robert debenedictis held over  in aqua america stock nicholas debenedictis has been a big campaign donor to republican politicians  more than  over the last decade  including some such as senator pat toomey and congressman pat meehan who oppose samesex marriage robert debenedictis three years ago settled a consumer class action for  million involving the sale and marketing of hair loss remedy avacor through the company global vision with which he was affiliated  global vision previously has drawn judicial ire arising from its alleged relationship with anthony imbriolo who in  was held liable for infringing upon the minoxidil patent and was the target of collection efforts by upjohn  in september  a federal judge held global vision in contempt of court and the july  recommendations of a magistrate surmised that the freedom which imbriolo was given in accessing moving and spending globals assets surely suggests mismanagement if not outright corruption at global and the court does not find it unthinkable that global and imbriolo worked together to defeat plaintiffs upjohns collection efforts the wall street sauna was shut down by new york city authorities in  as a prohibited commercial sex venues pursuant to new york state sanitary code section  which states that no establishment shall make facilities available for the purpose of sexual activities where anal intercourse vaginal intercourse or fellatio take place and local health officials may close such establishments as criminal public nuisances in violation of penal law section  the east and west side clubs remain open notwithstanding numerous allegations that they are gay bathhouses at which sex presumably is occurring behind closed doors  for example wally wallace the former manager of the mineshaft and owner of the attic both of which have long been closed by city authorities alleged in an interview with jay blotcher for an article sex club owners  the fuck suck buck stops here in policing public sex south end press    that the east side club and wall street sauna survived    because they looked city officials in the eye and insisted that men were not using their facilities for a quick lunchtime fuck and mark milano a longtime aids activist in new york city alleged in an article how i joined the sex police for the body that the position taken by the west side club during a court hearing in an unsuccessful attempt to shut it down in the mids was funny one of the funniest moments came when the west side club went to court to stop its closure saying it was not a sex club the judge asked if you arent a sex club what are you you have no license to be a gym or a sauna were a conference center their lawyers replied for who professionals lawyers doctors ministers why do you have all those tiny rooms with beds in them for people to rest in between meetings but the west side club had one tactic the city couldnt beat hide all the sex paul galuccio one of the principals in the west side club with debenedictis at least at one time reportedly admitted that sex takes place on the premises to blother in  sex club owners the fuck suck buck stops here sex between men is an inevitability galuccio says several times in different ways a pragmatic businessman he says he is merely providing a desired service installing measures of safety which are costeffective and also soothe his conscience the west side club provides safer sex information condoms and lubrication gmhc volunteers come in occasionally to provide safer sex demonstrations monitors verbally admonish couples who choose to cavort in the open directing them to private rooms indeed dr demetre c daskalakis a professor at new york universitys school of medicine has been conducting hiv research in two manhattan bathhouses—the east side club and the west side club—since  as reported by a jan   article researchers support nyc bathhouse regulation for poz magazine  so far he has tested about  msms men who have sex with men for hiv and other stds and has referred those in need of health care to bellevue hospital which is funding his studies  a july   article hiv testing in nyc bathhouses by kristina fiore for medpage today states as the number of hiv cases in the us soars  especially among gay and black men and particularly in new york city  one physician is going where few have gone before in terms of prevention efforts straight to the latenight gay scene dr demetre daskalakis runs the firstever hiv testing venue at a new york bathhouse in chelsea    daskalakis can find no better place to do his work today some men come to the club just for the free test not the sex that daskalakis says makes keeping the clinic door open into the wee hours of a manhattan weekend morning worth it  the preliminary results from dr daskalakiss research are not encouraging hiv positive msm attending bathhouses represent an important group to target for hiv education and prevention since many continue to engage in highrisk sexual activities robert debenedictis has engaged in financial transactions with individuals who have done business with oncealleged mafiatied figures  a corporate entity involving robert debenedictis borrowed money from frank biancaniello pursuant to a mortgage agreement  frank biancaniello also has provided mortgage loans to companies in which lorenzo devardo and dominick acquista are involved  dominick acquista was identified by the fbi as a gambino associate in the past and lorenzo devardo once pleaded guilty to possessing a pistol and silencer in the socalled pizza connection case  others who have executed mortgage agreements involving devardo are companies affiliated with bernard paige which also provided mortgage loans for some properties owned by companies tied to suspected genovese associate jennie tobin who operated gay bars out of the premises both robert debenedictis and frank biancaniello have provided mortgage loans through separate agreements to companies controlled by salvatore gaudio and his father nicola aka luigi  salvatore was busted in  pursuant to an elaborate sting for allegedly failing to pay sales taxes on bottled beer out of an establishment he owned and he later pleaded guilty to offering a false instrument for filing in the second degree and was given a conditional discharge contingent on his making restitution to the state and city of his sales taxes  in october  the father and son together executed a mortgage agreement involving nearly a million dollars with nowdeceased gambino underboss giuseppe joseph arcuri in connection with their purchase of  second avenue from the mobster  one corporate entity involving a downtown property in which salvatore gaudio had an ownership interest  identified as the companys address an office suite at  east th street in a public filing which is a property in which debenedictis both has an ownership interest and out of where the east side club operates in april  this blog friends of ours revealed the investment relationship between the debenedictis brothers in the fort lauderdale real estate but deleted it upon receiving an email dated april  from aqua americas thengeneral counsel roy stahl which stated i am in receipt of your march   email to donna alston of aqua america concerning robert debenedictis  as general counsel for aqua america i can confirm that neither aqua america nor any of its subsidiaries has ever had any association with robert debenedictis  furthermore nicholas debenedictis has no personal investments with robert debenedictis it appears that you or someone on your behalf has written a blog article entitled aqua america ceos questionable investment which was published and posted on a friends of ours web page on april    you are hereby placed on notice that statements and implications in that article are false misleading defamatory and cast nicholas debenedictis and aqua america in a false light  please immediately remove any direct or implied reference to nicholas debenedictis and aqua america from this article or any other similar publication for which you are responsible  it is clear that this false publication was made knowingly and as a malicious effort to tarnish the reputation of nicholas debenedictis and aqua america  your motivation for injuring nicholas debenedictis and aqua america is unclear to us but your intent to do so is quite clear remove any references to nicholas debenedictis and aqua america from the article at once to avoid unnecessary costly and prompt litigation query whether the demand to remove the material  arguably intellectual property as written  under the specter of costly    litigation from a blog involved in interstate commerce which both generates and expends revenue in its operation may have risen to the level of an extortionate threat under the hobbs act  see eg united states v bornscheuer  fd  th cir  affirming conviction under the hobbs act by holding that the extortion target experienced fear of economic harm where the defendant threatened continuing litigation which if carried to fruition would have resulted in economic loss  the expense the extortion target would necessarily incur in defending    lawsuits although standing by the story friends of ours nevertheless capitulated to stahls demand and by email dated april   the aqua america general counsel advised the following we appreciate your removal of the references to our company and our ceo from what you have confirmed is your blog in reply to your many questions i can confirm that nicholas debenedictis has a brother named robert debenedictis  as stated in my previous email neither aqua america nor any of its subsidiaries has ever had any association with robert debenedictis  in the past nicholas debenedictis had a personal investment with his brother in some real estate in florida but at this time he has no personal investments with him  beyond that we neither confirm nor deny any of the other information in your emails and blog entry  please understand that it is your obligation to ensure that any statements you make are not defamatory in any manner either by themselves or in the context they are made once again thank you for your responsiveness in removing the references to our company and our ceo from your blog  we expect that there will be no future references by you to our company or our ceo which is in any way defamatory or puts them in a false light frankly friends of ours never understood what the aqua america general counsel found specifically objectionable  this blog wants to emphasize that it is not claiming that aqua america made any investments with robert debenedictis only that its ceo nicholas debenedictis had a onetime personal investment with him in a piece of real property which was isolated from the gay businessmans other ventures  moreover this blog is not accusing anyone of any wrongdoing and makes no adverse inferences from any financial transactions rather it simply is reporting information and allegations from corporate filings previous articles and other public information  finally the
