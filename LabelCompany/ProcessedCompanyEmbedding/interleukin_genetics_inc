one is inherited from each parent buccal swab a noninvasive buccal brush or swab that when rubbed on the inside of the cheek collects cells for dna analysis this is a technique commonly used to collect dna samples cholesterol cholesterol is a soft fatlike waxy substance found in the bloodstream and in all your bodys cells cholesterol is normally made by the liver and also supplied in the diet through animal products such as meats poultry fish and dairy products its an important part of a healthy body because its used for producing cell membranes and some hormones insulating nerves and serves other needed bodily functions but too much cholesterol in the blood is a major risk for coronary heart disease which leads to heart attack chromosome packaged dna and protein in cells human beings have  pairs of chromosomes onehalf of each pair is inherited from a parent cytokine a protein or peptide that serves as a communication signal to cells examples are interleukins interferons and tumor necrosis factors that facilitate the inflammatory response diagnostic a test which measures the active presence of a disease a condition or biomarkers of disease dna deoxyribonucleic acid dna the molecule inside the nucleus or core of each of the body’s trillions of cells that carries genetic instructions for making living organisms dna is made up of sequences or what is referred to as your genetic code each gene is the code or recipe for a single protein everyone has the same genes – in fact  of everyone’s dna is the same doublehelix of the dna dna molecule shows two strands of dna spiraling around each other like a big ladder twisted into a coil dna sequencing the process by which the exact order of the base pairs in a segment of dna is determined gene a segment of dna that contains the information necessary to make a protein gene a functional segment of dna located in a specific region on a chromosome that directs the formation of a protein gene expression the process of converting the information encoded in the dna into rna mrna trna and rrna most genes are transcribed into messenger rna mrna and ultimately into a protein product genetic counseling a shortterm educational counseling process for persons and families who have an inherited disease or who are at risk for such a disease genetic counseling provides persons with information about their condition and helps them make informed decisions genetic risk assessment genetic risk assessment testing is intended to identify common genetic variations that produce varying biochemical responses that are directly involved in the underlying cause of a disease and are associated with adverse disease outcomes genetic variations that result in a biochemical imbalance and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes may provide further understanding as to why some people are more prone than others to developing serious chronic diseases and why some people respond to treatments for those diseases differently than others by identifying these underlying biological mechanisms preventive interventions can be targeted to help reinstate the biochemical balance which may help prolong health and wellness in these individuals genetics the study of inheritance patterns of specific traits genome the sum total of all the genetic information in an organism its instruction book—the blueprint that directs the development and functioning of human beings and other organisms genomics the study of genes and their function genotype the genetic makeup of a person as opposed to the phenotype which is the physiological manifestation of the genotype and its expression heterozygoteheterozygous possessing two different copies of a particular gene eg two different alleles one inherited from each parent a heterozygous person is also called an allele carrier highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol and other fats cant dissolve in the blood they have to be transported to and from the cells by special carriers called lipoproteins cholesterol hdl is known as the good cholesterol the body makes hdl cholesterol for protection it carries cholesterol away from the arteries studies suggest that high levels of hdl cholesterol reduce the risk of heart attack in the average man hdl cholesterol levels range from  to  mgdl in the average woman they range from  to  mgdl hdl cholesterol thats less than  mgdl is low low hdl cholesterol increases the risk for heart disease smoking being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower hdl cholesterol the higher the hdl numbers the better ³mgdl

and the environment nutrigenetics the study of the mechanisms by which bioactive dietary components communicate with the genetic material and how genetic variation affects the interaction between these bioactive dietary components and the health and disease potential of a person nutrigenomics the study of the effects of bioactive dietary components on the genome proteome the sum total of all proteins and metabolome the sum of all metabolites at a global population level nutritional genomics a field of study focused on optimizing an individual’s genetic potential through understanding how genetic variations snps influence molecular pathways and define nutritional needs conversely the field is focused on the influence of nutrition and lifestyle on the molecular expression of genetic variations includes nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics phenotype the observable traits of characteristics of an organism such as hair color or weight or the presence or absence of a disease phenotypic traits are not necessarily genetic polygenic characteristic resulting from the combined action of alleles of more than one gene eg heart disease diabetes and some cancers such characteristics are inherited but they depend on the simultaneous presence of several alleles which typically results in hereditary patterns that are more complex than those of single gene traits polymorphism a common variation among persons in the sequence of dna technically a locus is polymorphic when two or more of the alleles at this locus are present in  of the population risk assessment testing or identification of risk factors genetic environmental clinical or behavioral that have been associated with increased susceptibility to a disease adverse clinical outcome or health condition risk assessment does not claim that a person definitely will or will not develop a certain condition or disease however when risk factors are present the person is predisposed increased likelihood for the disease if heshe does not counteract them when the nongenetic factors are removed or controlled that individual will have a better chance for longterm health signal transduction process by which chemical or physical messages are communicated between the surface of a cell and its interior in a stepwise manner that results in a response by the cell single gene disorder an inherited condition caused by a mutant allele at a single locus in the dna such a trait is monogenic eg duchenne muscular dystrophy and sickle cell disease single nucleotide polymorphisms snp pronounced “snip” a variation in a single dna nucleotide or code recipe for a protein most of the variation in people is due to snps there are millions of these in humans however only certain snps are functional ie associated with a difference in molecular function significant enough to effect clinical measurements and risk of disease numbers are used to identify the chromosomal locations of snps and hetero – or homozygosity total blood cholesterol high cholesterol is a leading risk factor for heart disease when there is too much cholesterol in your blood cholesterol and other substances form plaques in the walls of your arteries over time plaque causes hardening of the arteries so that arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart is slowed down the blood carries oxygen to the heart and if enough blood and oxygen cannot reach the heart an individual may suffer chest pain if the blood supply to a portion of the heart is completely cut off by a blockage the result is a heart attack heart attacks most commonly occur when plaques become fragile and rupture then blood clots are formed and can completely cut off blood supply to a portion of the heart high total cholesterol has no symptoms until a blockage occurs that can result in a heart attack if not corrected in general people who have a total cholesterol level of  mgdl have twice the risk of coronary heart disease as people whose cholesterol level is  mgdl total blood cholesterol will fall into one of these categories desirable – less than  mgdl borderline high risk –  mgdl high risk –  mgdl and over trait a characteristic associated with a gene that can be quantified or described such as eye color flower color height intelligence or the presenceabsence of an enzyme variation a change in dna variations are often harmful
