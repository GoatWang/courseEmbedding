bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor

a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your

name in school transportation that predates the familiar yellow school bus seen all over the united states and canada beginning in the th century craftsmen in richmond indiana at wayne works and its successors built horsedrawn vehicles including kid hacks evolving into automobiles and virtually all types of bus bodies during the th century wayne products eventually included school buses transit buses highway coaches military and shuttle buses ambulances and even huge bus bodies pulled by tractor trailers used to haul oil field workers in the middle east among many innovations wayne pioneered the guard rails on the sides of all school buses today inboard wheelchair lifts and even highheadroom doors a special accommodation for mobilitychallenged persons requiring head and neck support from above the company was the first with a school bus based upon a cutaway van chassis the wayne busette a chassis design which more than  years later remains one of the most popular in use in north american markets the crowning safety achievement was the wayne lifeguard structural design introduced in  which featured continuous interior and exterior longitudinal panels the lifeguards design helped pave the way for the allimportant us federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss for school buses most of which became applicable on april   in the years after wayne continued to be a leader in bus safety engineering wayne went through many owners during the second half of the th century the business underwent periods under the ownership of divco as divcowayne boise cascade indian head inc and the thyssenbornemisza group it moved to a greatly expanded facility adjacent to interstate  in  where it became a familiar landmark to millions of travelers after encountering a difficult market cycle and industry downturn due to overcapacity beginning in the early s wayne corporation finally closed in  several efforts to continue to utilize portions of the assets and build school buses ended in  as of  thousands of wayne buses remained in service although the numbers are dwindling each year as new buses replace them in school and commercial operations some have been converted to motor homes and other uses the former wayne corporation property along interstate  is becoming reutilized for a number of retail and industrial enterprises early historyedit after starting out as wayne agricultural works in dublin indiana in the mid th century all manufacturing was centralized at richmond indiana most bus bodies consisted of inhouse manufactured parts and purchased components manufactured by others combined into bus bodies in assembly operations thus the major two functions of the richmond indiana plant were manufacturing of parts and assembly wayne bus bodies were also assembled at multiple locations of truck body dealers around the us and at a canadian assembly plant welles ltd in windsor ontario kits were also shipped overseas even after all north american assembly was eventually centralized in richmond indiana and windsor ontario in the early s kid hacksedit a  ford model t kid hackbus body manufacturer unknown by combining the kid hack wagon body with an automotive chassis wayne works helped create the school bus in its earliest form waynes predecessor wayne works was founded in the united states of america in  wayne works began by making horsedrawn vehicles by  and possibly earlier it is known that wayne works was making horsedrawn school carriages which many people referred to as school hacks school cars school trucks or kid hacks as education in the united states shifted from small one room schools to fewer but larger multiroom schools fewer children lived within walking distances initially as many students who needed transportation lived in rural areas the need was filled by adapted farm vehicles soon these practices and operations evolved and expanded into todays school transportation systems beginning in the early s through the s several automobile designers and manufacturers were located in richmond among the automobiles manufactured there was the richmond which was built by the wayne works the rodefeld and the crosley the wayne county historical museum in richmond indiana has a rare  richmond on display along with horsedrawn kid hack also manufactured by the wayne works first busesedit according to several sources in  wayne works mounted a wooden kid hack onto an automobile chassis creating a predecessor to the modern motor school bus in the vehicle bodies for school transportation that the company produced during this era passengers sat on perimeter seating facing the sides rather than the front of the bus entry and egress was through a door at the rear a design begun in nonmotorized days to help avoiding startling the horses this feature was retained becoming the rear emergency exit seen on todays buses the primary mode of ingressegress was now through a curbside door safety innovationsedit by  wayne works was building allsteel bus bodies in the following few years the school bus bodies began to include a group of heavyduty collision rails or guard rails as an added safety feature wayne works was one of the earliest school bus companies to offer glass in place of the standard canvas curtains in the passenger area glass did not become a common feature until the s although not the first to introduce the type in the s wayne works was among the first manufacturers to produce transitstyle school buses a body with a more or less flat frontend design initial production of waynes forward control bus bodies were conversions of conventional bus chassis however the conventional design with a cowled chassis known as type c on modern school buses would be the bulk of waynes sales until production ended in  world war ii – wooden bodies and trailer busesedit to conserve steel for war use wayne works and other manufacturers reverted from allsteel construction to building some bus bodies with wooden components during world war ii the company also developed trailertype bodies for military use which could transport up to  passengers pulled by a truck thousands of military ambulance bodies were also produced the company also did some reconstruction on older buses and trucks to extend their lives during the war years as did other bus body manufacturers in  as the end of world war ii approached wayne returned to building allsteel bodies welles canadian bus assemblyedit welles corporation in windsor ontario was named for halsey v welles who founded h v welles ltd in  originally named warford corp of canada it was first established to distribute warford transmissions expanding into aftermarket products primarily for ford trucks in  welles corp became the sole canadian distributor of wayne works school buses in  under new yorkbased financier newton glekel divcowayne acquired welles corp ltd and incorporated it as a new subsidiary division of divcowayne diversificationedit wayne works began to diversify into other fields besides bus production through several acquisitions in the mids these acquisitions primarily brought wayne into the world of professional car production the company purchased meteor motor car company in piqua ohio in  meteor built professional cars such as limousines and ambulances two years later in  wayne acquired aj millers professional car building company of bellefontaine ohio the aj miller company had begun in  by making horse carriages and then started making automobiles in the early part of the th century however the small company found it could not compete with the larger automobile makers so they began specializing in hearses and ambulances over the years the miller hearses became known and used throughout the world the miller co was combined with waynes existing professional car subsidiary meteor motor car company forming the new millermeteor mm division of wayne the  companies competed in  but were doing business as a combination by  divcowayne corporation –edit in  under the leadership of newton glekel divco corporation bought the wayne works a school bus builder in richmond indiana and renamed itself divcowayne corporation divcowayne also known as dw was a conglomerate involved in the manufacturing of trucks school buses hearses ambulances and mobile homes and apparently also had had an electronics section involved in aerospace technology divcoedit main article divco divco delivery truck divco stands for detroit industrial vehicles company founded in  divco was known for its pioneering delivery vehicles especially milk trucks from  to  divco produced multistop delivery trucks only the vw beetle stayed in production with the same basic model for a longer period of time divco trucks have become popular collectible vehicles today during the divcowayne era the truck manufacturing of divcowayne continued to be through the former divco portion some divco trucks were modified with seats and windows from the wayne works to produce a divco dividend bus very few of these units were built between  and  virtually all bus and ambulance manufacturing was through the wayne corporation portion of divcowayne and subsidiary units millermeteor and cotnerbevington exportedit wayne export was another division which specialized in selling disassembled wayne bodies knockdown kits ckds outside north america by  wayne bus bodies were in use in  different countries in  wayne licensed the spanish sa bosuga to build in barcelona coach bodies based on waynes technology and designs these were marketed as bosuga wayne utilizing mainly pegaso and barreirosaec chassis the venture was shortlived since the spanish market for coach bodies was crowded other productsedit during the late s and early s the divcowayne conglomerate would diversify its product lines entering vehicle segments far removed from divco delivery vehicles and wayne school buses in addition the conglomerate expanded into various nonautomotive products professional carsedit the professional car quoted from a leading trade association is loosely defined as a custombodied vehicle based on passenger car styling and used in the funeral rescue or livery services such vehicles may be hearses flower cars service cars ambulances limousines or cars specially built to combine two or more of these different functions such as combination hearseambulances sedan ambulances or invalid coaches using vehicles such as the cadillac commercial chassis as a donor vehicle the bodywork including the roof glass and doors was completed by coachbuilders from the dashboard rearward nearly all exterior and interior bodywork was manufactured by hand by  professional and combination cars became obsolete as general motors and ford downsized their fullsize automobiles while funeral cars remained based on automobiles ambulances were shifted to vanbased chassis millermeteoredit wayne professional cars a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance professional car manufacturers miller and meteor newly combined as millermeteor were brought into the fold of divcowayne as the newly formed conglomerate was developing its opportunities in this field although the recently combined millermeteor company was initially based at bellefontaine ohio originally the home of the aj miller company under divcowayne ownership it was later relocated to piqua ohio meteors old hometown nearby ecto the vehicle used by the main characters in the  film ghostbusters and its  sequel is a conversion of a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance cotnerbevingtonedit divcowayne acquired cotnerbevington cb in  and it became a subsidiary of wayne corporation comet coach company was based in memphis tennessee in  the coachbuilder sold its comet trade name rights to the lincolnmercury division of ford motor company for use on the mercury version of the ford falcon in  the mercury comet was introduced starting with the  model year the former comet coach co was renamed cotnerbevington named after the two founders of the company they moved from memphis tennessee a few miles north to blytheville arkansas cb stayed in business through the  model year building only on oldsmobile automobile chassis and truckbased ambulances after about  waynes line of truckbased ambulances sentinel suburbans starting for the  model year vanguard chevrolet vans for  and medicruiser dodge vans for  were built in the blytheville facility the sentinel suburbans received a headroom increase for  but were only built through the  model year after that the sentinel brand name was used on waynes line of type i pickup chassis modular ambulances body shells were produced at the richmond indiana bus plant for careovan ambulance units based upon cutaway chassis and wayne busette body nonautomotive divisionsedit divcowayne corporation manufactured housing brands included kozy elcar star and national electronics and aerospace products were offered through dw electronics in cincinnati ohio the divcowayne conglomerate also had a financial arm divcowayne acceptance corporation which was also known as divcowayne financial wayne acceptance or financial corporation and wayne financial sales corporation new richmond factoryedit during the earlier years of the school bus industry the factory manufactured most of the parts used to assemble a bus body but it was customary for these to be shipped unassembled to body dealers around the united states and canada for assembly onto an incomplete truck chassis gradually as highway transportation of completed buses became more practical and school bus bodies became more sophisticated the assembly of complete bodies onto truck chassis in the united states and canada became centralized at locations owned by the body companies the companies often continued to ship kits overseas by the mids several other body companies notably blue bird body company and perley a thomas car works maintained assembly plants at multiple locations in the united states instead of establishing multiple assembly points in the us wayne chose to replace the overcrowded and aged wayne works facility on e street near downtown richmond with a single new plant large enough to handle both manufacturing and united states assembly due primarily to canadian import tariffs the separate canadian assembly plant welles ltd had been established and was maintained for canadian production as early as  divcowayne started plans for the construction of a new plant initially a site was selected in florence kentucky where the company purchased an option to acquire  acres  km in an industrial park the community in richmond indiana responded to the possible loss of the plant and jobs with provision of a acre  km parcel conveniently located near the intersection of interstate  and us  northwest of the city in  wayne corporation relocated from the former wayne works plant to the new site on industries road about  miles  km northwest of downtown richmond the new  million facility had  square feet  m under a single roof it featured fully modern steel manufacturing presses rustproofing equipment paint booths and could handle assembly lines for all product lines distribution networkedit more than a few wayne dealerships were operated by school bus contractors ara transportation and laidlaw were the largest others included bus and bodies of plaistow new hampshire town  country transportation of warren rhode island rohrer of duncannon pennsylvania virginia overland transportation of richmond virginia and school bus services of shawnee mission kansas these school bus contractors several of whom were also involved in contracting paratransit services found having a dealership provided both a source and an input to product design at wayne as well as a natural outlet for sale of surplus equipment at the end of contract periods breakupedit in  the divcowayne conglomerate was sold by newton glekel to boise cascade a company which was primarily seeking the housing manufacturing subsidiaries boise cascade resold wayne and its subsidiaries to indian head inc another conglomerate about the same time that divcowayne was sold to indian head the divco portion was separated and divested production of divco products continued until  wayne corporation an indian head company –edit  wayneinternational school bus retired divcowayne had formed a union and had expanded into a moderate sizedconglomerate with all facilities basically within  miles  km of waynes richmond indiana base in contrast indian head was already a large and diversified corporate conglomerate when it purchased wayne corporation and its subsidiaries in  indian head inc acquired wayne corp which its history recorded as maker of school buses ambulances hearses professional cars from divcowayne newgeneration school busesedit the late s and early s led to the development of new platforms suitable for use for small school buses additionally to improve the basic structural integrity of fullsize school buses wayne engineers went back to the drawing board and changed how school buses were constructed with an allnew body design papooseedit in the early s the principal platform for school buses smaller than conventional types but with more than  wheels was the truck chassis in widespread use for commercial delivery work the step van within the school bus body industry this type were often called p chassis in addition to wayne blue bird carpenter superior thomas and ward each developed school bus bodies based upon p chassis produced by either general motors ford or both waynes body product for the step van chassis was called the papoose the frontend of the design of the papoose was designed to afford maximum visibility and use flat glass resulting in an appearance which was not aesthetically pleasing it was described by some observers as severe and the funnylooking little bus had other nicknames even less kind in addition to its unusual appearance the wayne papoose faced another disadvantage in the wayne product line the market was highly competitive with all five other major school bus body builders participating waynes marketers wanted something more radical to differentiate a small capacity wayne product busetteedit main article wayne busette in the early s wayne designed a school bus even smaller than the papoose the busette was unique because it was one of the first school buses to be built on a cutaway van chassis previously small school buses were adaptations of fullsize vans or large suvs such as the chevrolet suburban or international travelall the busette featured dual rear wheels on the rear axle which provided extra stability and capability over conversion vehicles introduced in  the busette and its transette commercial variant would set a precedent for how all small buses are designednot just school buses the busette and transette also were among the first small buses to be fitted with wheelchair lifts lifeguardedit main article wayne lifeguard in the early s wayne was one of the first school bus manufacturers to introduce guard rails and allmetal construction into school bus design while safer than wooden body construction riveted metal body panels posed problems of their own in a crash a weak point of the body was identified as the joints where body panels were fastened together in  safety engineers at ward body works of conway arkansas a competing bus manufacturer subjected one of their school bus bodies to a multiple roll test and noted the separation at the joints ward noted that many of their competitors were using far fewer rivets and fasteners this resulted in new attention by all manufacturers to the number and quality of fasteners as opposed to simply adding more fasteners wayne engineers proposed eliminating the body panel joints entirely essentially the entire side of the bus would have to be formed from a single piece of metal the roof panel would be manufactured in the same fashion one piece cut to length fasteners would only be needed for the interior structure the guardrails and at the rear of the bus in  wayne introduced the new design branded the lifeguard although wayne needed specialized equipment to manufacture the lifeguards body panels the design also reduced overall body weight and manhours required for assembly indian head and thyssenedit in  indian head established a joint business venture with thyssenbornemisza group nv a dutch holding company in  the rest of indian head industries was sold to and folded into thyssenbornemisza a conglomerate based in monaco which was owned by one man baron hans heinrich heini thyssenbornemisza the thyssenbornemisza years –edit thyssen spent much of the next – years selling off or closing its north american investments in the late s and early s the portions of thyssenbornemisza which formed the wayne corporation went through a period of decline wayne professional cars ripedit the professional car industry was negatively and profoundly impacted by three factors in the late s at the time many units served as both ambulances and funeral vehicles called combinations combinations disappeared from general service in the late s the downsizing of americas biggest luxury cars beginning with the  model year forced major changes upon professional car builders who were dependent upon car frames purchased from general motors and ford motor company to begin their conversion processes  cadillacmillermeteor hearse customized regulatory changes at the same time changes in the federal ambulance regulations governing minimum width headroom and equipment levels generally required larger vehicles these were part of the  national ems systems act which was passed by congress in  and implemented four years later in  required that communities receiving federal funds for their programs had ambulances that met new federal specifications three design styles meet the criteria and are still in use today type i uses a ton truck chassis with a modular compartment type ii has a heavy duty van body with a raised roof type iii has a cutaway van chassis with a modular compartment passengerbased vehicles were purposely excluded from legislation and the last americanmade automobilebased ambulance was built in  change in ems providers in the early s wayne introduced a full line of noncarbased ambulances the type iii medicruiser was based on the popular dodge bseries van tradesman panel van the careovan was a type ii ambulance and the type i guardian an early version of a ton truckbased modular ambulance by the late s government standards and practical necessities were combining to make professional carbased ambulances unsuitable for virtually all ems transport work downsizing for  the cadillac commercial chassis was downsized to reduce vehicle weight and fuel consumption that year the cadillac division built  of these special lengthened units of that total only  lifeliner cadillac ambulances were manufactured by waynes millermeteor subsidiary for  cadillacs commercial chassis production further declined to only  units millermeteor received orders for only  ambulances there were no  millermeteor ambulances on december   the company with roots tracing back to  closed its doors the company laidoff  employees and terminated the contracts of their  north american distributors by the late s as the situation became critical wayne corporation the parent of mm and cb and waynes thyssen owners chose not to invest heavily in either firm as would have been required in the uncertain futures of the diverging professional car and ambulance building industries there were no buyers for either subsidiary as a going business in  cotnerbevington ambulance product line was sold to gene knisley owner of midcontinent conversion co which was an ambulance and medicar builder in kansas city missouri the cb plant in blytheville arkansas was closed a few years later the rights to the millermeteor name were acquired and resurrected by another professional car builder in norwalk ohio which in  was producing a line of funeral coaches and limousines on cadillac and lincoln chassis under the millermeteor brand name rabbitransit mpg taxiedit about the time of the  energy crisis waynes engineering department experimented with creation of a stretch conversion of the dieselpowered volkswagen rabbit the rabbitransit vehicle would have the potential to transport a large number of passengers – with very efficient fuel consumption in comparison with other automobiles the minitaxi project was dropped by wayne for potential liability reasons the frequently seen rabbitransit at the richmond plant could not be sold for highway use and it was later destroyed the end of the big sixedit in  when the ownership of wayne corporation shifted from indian head to thyssen wayne was one of six major school bus body builders in the united states wayne apparently enjoyed some profitable years in the late s buoyed by sales of its busette and transette product lines by  the company was one of the big six school bus body manufacturing companies in the united states competing with blue bird body company carpenter body works superior coach company thomas built buses inc and ward body works the big six were joined by crown coach corporation and gillig bros manufacturers which traded primarily on the west coast a downturn in north american school bus purchase volumes began in the late s as the children of the baby boom completed their elementary and secondary educations bidding competition for reduced volumes became devastating to profits and even liquidity although not publicly reported as corporate ownership under thyssen was private it is likely that wayne and welles began incurring losses around  or  and these continued into  by  wayne dealers and union leaders were told that the annual losses at waynewelles were reportedly in the millions and the thyssen owners were poised to end the relationship and financial hemorrhage in  following significant concessions by its unionized workers members of united auto workers local   which were intended to make the company more efficient wayne corporation and its canadian subsidiary welles ltd were sold by thyssen to new owners wayne corporation richmond transportation corporation –edit a new logo was adopted for wayne in the s in  richmond transportation corporation rtc was formed by jack h dekruif a corona del mar californiabased industrialist and several officers who had served at wayne for many years under the indian head and thyssen ownership rtc acquired wayne corporation and its welles subsidiary in canada in february  terry g whitesell was named president of rtc a civic leader in richmond indiana his prior responsibilities at wayne included sales marketing and purchasing over a period of more than  years whitesell was wellknown within the company its dealer and supplier networks and the industry although as industrialist investor dekruif had a track record of liquidating troubled businesses he was persuaded to allow the new organization to operate and compete several successful years followed the chaperone and chaperone ii products on cutaway van chassis did well and several wayne dealercontractors were expanding most notably laidlaw in the fall of  the company was preparing to launch an initial public stock offering ipo when black

d school bus named the lifestar the first production versions were introduced in  featuring the same sidepanel construction as the lifeguard lifestar was to be targeted for the school bus market unlike its largest competitors wayne did not have the manufacturing equipment or capacity to build chassis inhouse consequently chassis from an outside supplier was crucial supply problems outside of the companys control led to the use of several suppliers for the lifestar over its production run richmond transportation corporation rtc declared bankruptcy in august  assets were sold by a federal bankruptcy judge at auction that fall epilogueedit main article wayne wheeled vehicles after the bankruptcy of richmond transportation corporation wayne corporation effectively ceased to exist during its liquidation the product rights and many of the assets of the company aside from the company itself and its liabilities were purchased by a subsidiary of harsco corporation reorganized as wayne wheeled vehicles wwv production of the chaperone lifeguard and lifestar were transferred to a facility in marysville ohio to supplement production of military trucks in june  after an attempted sale of the company fell through wwv was closed down by its parent company at the time of its closure wayne was in the process of launching the rd a rearengine school bus featuring innovations that would have been new to the school bus industry the rd was never massproduced some features were eventually adopted by competitive builders while initially shuttered after the closure the large richmond factory would play a key role in the future of a major competitor to wayne late in the s additionally part of the lifeguard and the busette designs were adopted by competitors as well mid busedit see also mid bus in  following the collapse of the professional car industry and growing overcapacity among school bus body manufacturers superior coach company of lima ohio was shut down by its parent company shellerglobe the next year mid bus was formed by three former superior employees along with seven coworkers they began manufacturing small school buses in a different facility in lima while fullsize buses still retained the superior name the company debuted a small bus named superior by mid bus a conversion of a fullsize van it also added a raised roof reinforced body sides and school bus windows in  the superior by mid bus name was dropped in favor of mid bus by the end of the s mid bus sought to compete with largerscale school bus manufactures the company sought expertise in developing a product based on a cutaway van in  wayne corporation discontinued busette production in favor of its newer chaperone model additionally the company was closing the welles plant in canada where busette production had been located mid bus entered into an arrangement with wayne to take over busette production in its own facility in ohiocitation needed not only did the use of an existing design lower development costs but the popularity of the busette especially among head start agencies allowed for an existing customer base crown by carpenteredit see also crown by carpenter in may  carpenter body works of mitchell indiana purchased the tooling intellectual and product rights of crown coach corporation a californiabased school bus manufacturer that had closed that year while carpenter had originally planned to restart production of the crown supercoach series ii its high cost and complexity of production would cause that proposal to be shelved in favor of its own design in  carpenter began a series of major changes within the company in order to regain lost market share to modernize its production facilities carpenter moved out of its aging facilities in mitchell indiana and leased the shuttered wayne facilities in richmond moving its corporate headquarters there by moving to the wayne facilities carpenter had the asset of combining its own team with former wayne corporation employees both the leadership and workforce based at richmond included a number of veterans of the former wayne operations there as such they brought considerable experience and knowledge of the plant and industry to the effort nevertheless major outside forces still to be faced were a supply of suitable chassis and the overcapacity of the body industry as part of the move carpenter unveiled major changes for its  product line on the outside the body now wore fulllength guard rails above the wheels under the skin the body was redesigned with singlepiece roof bows new welding procedures allowed by the equipment at richmond strengthened roof joints unlike a crucial structural flaw later found in mitchellproduced buses inside the bus wayne tooling was used to update certain areas of the carpenter buses on conventional buses carpenter reused the driver control panel and windshield from the wayne lifeguard all fullsize buses would use wayne entry doors the company considered the transformation so extensive that it changed its name and company logo resurrecting the first half of the crown coach name carpenter was now known as crown by carpenter and used its own version of a logo introduced by crown coach in the late s in an effort to further diversify its product line outside of school buses the company introduced a delivery truck loosely based on its cadet bus products in  carpenter was acquired by one of its largest chassis suppliers spartan motors of charlotte michigan spartan motors was a chassis supplier known for highmargin lowvolume markets some examples include chassis for fire apparatus and luxury motorhomes spartan was a supplier for certain models of the blue bird wanderlodge for example during the economic times around the millennium lower initial capital costs for school buses seemed to trump their longevity when it was time for purchasing decisions financially pressed districts and contractors tended to select cheaper products with short life cycles this was much the same dilemma faced by wayne wheeled vehicles parent company harscobmy where a lesser quantity of higher quality products at a correspondingly higher price had also been the plants historical output carpenter had been struggling for almost  years when it too finally ended school bus production in  spartan by then a ⅔ owner did not see a solution to the market dilemma and felt the projected continued losses would exceed the value to their business plan voting to end the venture future of the plantedit this article needs to be updated please update

overviewedit wayne is a name in school transportation that predates the familiar yellow school bus seen all over the united states and canada beginning in the th century craftsmen in richmond indiana at wayne works and its successors built horsedrawn vehicles including kid hacks evolving into automobiles and virtually all types of bus bodies during the th century wayne products eventually included school buses transit buses highway coaches military and shuttle buses ambulances and even huge bus bodies pulled by tractor trailers used to haul oil field workers in the middle east among many innovations wayne pioneered the guard rails on the sides of all school buses today inboard wheelchair lifts and even highheadroom doors a special accommodation for mobilitychallenged persons requiring head and neck support from above the company was the first with a school bus based upon a cutaway van chassis the wayne busette a chassis design which more than  years later remains one of the most popular in use in north american markets the crowning safety achievement was the wayne lifeguard structural design introduced in  which featured continuous interior and exterior longitudinal panels the lifeguards design helped pave the way for the allimportant us federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss for school buses most of which became applicable on april   in the years after wayne continued to be a leader in bus safety engineering wayne went through many owners during the second half of the th century the business underwent periods under the ownership of divco as divcowayne boise cascade indian head inc and the thyssenbornemisza group it moved to a greatly expanded facility adjacent to interstate  in  where it became a familiar landmark to millions of travelers after encountering a difficult market cycle and industry downturn due to overcapacity beginning in the early s wayne corporation finally closed in  several efforts to continue to utilize portions of the assets and build school buses ended in  as of  thousands of wayne buses remained in service although the numbers are dwindling each year as new buses replace them in school and commercial operations some have been converted to motor homes and other uses the former wayne corporation property along interstate  is becoming reutilized for a number of retail and industrial enterprises early historyedit after starting out as wayne agricultural works in dublin indiana in the mid th century all manufacturing was centralized at richmond indiana most bus bodies consisted of inhouse manufactured parts and purchased components manufactured by others combined into bus bodies in assembly operations thus the major two functions of the richmond indiana plant were manufacturing of parts and assembly wayne bus bodies were also assembled at multiple locations of truck body dealers around the us and at a canadian assembly plant welles ltd in windsor ontario kits were also shipped overseas even after all north american assembly was eventually centralized in richmond indiana and windsor ontario in the early s kid hacksedit a  ford model t kid hackbus body manufacturer unknown by combining the kid hack wagon body with an automotive chassis wayne works helped create the school bus in its earliest form waynes predecessor wayne works was founded in the united states of america in  wayne works began by making horsedrawn vehicles by  and possibly earlier it is known that wayne works was making horsedrawn school carriages which many people referred to as school hacks school cars school trucks or kid hacks as education in the united states shifted from small one room schools to fewer but larger multiroom schools fewer children lived within walking distances initially as many students who needed transportation lived in rural areas the need was filled by adapted farm vehicles soon these practices and operations evolved and expanded into todays school transportation systems beginning in the early s through the s several automobile designers and manufacturers were located in richmond among the automobiles manufactured there was the richmond which was built by the wayne works the rodefeld and the crosley the wayne county historical museum in richmond indiana has a rare  richmond on display along with horsedrawn kid hack also manufactured by the wayne works first busesedit according to several sources in  wayne works mounted a wooden kid hack onto an automobile chassis creating a predecessor to the modern motor school bus in the vehicle bodies for school transportation that the company produced during this era passengers sat on perimeter seating facing the sides rather than the front of the bus entry and egress was through a door at the rear a design begun in nonmotorized days to help avoiding startling the horses this feature was retained becoming the rear emergency exit seen on todays buses the primary mode of ingressegress was now through a curbside door safety innovationsedit by  wayne works was building allsteel bus bodies in the following few years the school bus bodies began to include a group of heavyduty collision rails or guard rails as an added safety feature wayne works was one of the earliest school bus companies to offer glass in place of the standard canvas curtains in the passenger area glass did not become a common feature until the s although not the first to introduce the type in the s wayne works was among the first manufacturers to produce transitstyle school buses a body with a more or less flat frontend design initial production of waynes forward control bus bodies were conversions of conventional bus chassis however the conventional design with a cowled chassis known as type c on modern school buses would be the bulk of waynes sales until production ended in  world war ii – wooden bodies and trailer busesedit to conserve steel for war use wayne works and other manufacturers reverted from allsteel construction to building some bus bodies with wooden components during world war ii the company also developed trailertype bodies for military use which could transport up to  passengers pulled by a truck thousands of military ambulance bodies were also produced the company also did some reconstruction on older buses and trucks to extend their lives during the war years as did other bus body manufacturers in  as the end of world war ii approached wayne returned to building allsteel bodies welles canadian bus assemblyedit welles corporation in windsor ontario was named for halsey v welles who founded h v welles ltd in  originally named warford corp of canada it was first established to distribute warford transmissions expanding into aftermarket products primarily for ford trucks in  welles corp became the sole canadian distributor of wayne works school buses in  under new yorkbased financier newton glekel divcowayne acquired welles corp ltd and incorporated it as a new subsidiary division of divcowayne diversificationedit wayne works began to diversify into other fields besides bus production through several acquisitions in the mids these acquisitions primarily brought wayne into the world of professional car production the company purchased meteor motor car company in piqua ohio in  meteor built professional cars such as limousines and ambulances two years later in  wayne acquired aj millers professional car building company of bellefontaine ohio the aj miller company had begun in  by making horse carriages and then started making automobiles in the early part of the th century however the small company found it could not compete with the larger automobile makers so they began specializing in hearses and ambulances over the years the miller hearses became known and used throughout the world the miller co was combined with waynes existing professional car subsidiary meteor motor car company forming the new millermeteor mm division of wayne the  companies competed in  but were doing business as a combination by  divcowayne corporation –edit in  under the leadership of newton glekel divco corporation bought the wayne works a school bus builder in richmond indiana and renamed itself divcowayne corporation divcowayne also known as dw was a conglomerate involved in the manufacturing of trucks school buses hearses ambulances and mobile homes and apparently also had had an electronics section involved in aerospace technology divcoedit main article divco divco delivery truck divco stands for detroit industrial vehicles company founded in  divco was known for its pioneering delivery vehicles especially milk trucks from  to  divco produced multistop delivery trucks only the vw beetle stayed in production with the same basic model for a longer period of time divco trucks have become popular collectible vehicles today during the divcowayne era the truck manufacturing of divcowayne continued to be through the former divco portion some divco trucks were modified with seats and windows from the wayne works to produce a divco dividend bus very few of these units were built between  and  virtually all bus and ambulance manufacturing was through the wayne corporation portion of divcowayne and subsidiary units millermeteor and cotnerbevington exportedit wayne export was another division which specialized in selling disassembled wayne bodies knockdown kits ckds outside north america by  wayne bus bodies were in use in  different countries in  wayne licensed the spanish sa bosuga to build in barcelona coach bodies based on waynes technology and designs these were marketed as bosuga wayne utilizing mainly pegaso and barreirosaec chassis the venture was shortlived since the spanish market for coach bodies was crowded other productsedit during the late s and early s the divcowayne conglomerate would diversify its product lines entering vehicle segments far removed from divco delivery vehicles and wayne school buses in addition the conglomerate expanded into various nonautomotive products professional carsedit the professional car quoted from a leading trade association is loosely defined as a custombodied vehicle based on passenger car styling and used in the funeral rescue or livery services such vehicles may be hearses flower cars service cars ambulances limousines or cars specially built to combine two or more of these different functions such as combination hearseambulances sedan ambulances or invalid coaches using vehicles such as the cadillac commercial chassis as a donor vehicle the bodywork including the roof glass and doors was completed by coachbuilders from the dashboard rearward nearly all exterior and interior bodywork was manufactured by hand by  professional and combination cars became obsolete as general motors and ford downsized their fullsize automobiles while funeral cars remained based on automobiles ambulances were shifted to vanbased chassis millermeteoredit wayne professional cars a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance professional car manufacturers miller and meteor newly combined as millermeteor were brought into the fold of divcowayne as the newly formed conglomerate was developing its opportunities in this field although the recently combined millermeteor company was initially based at bellefontaine ohio originally the home of the aj miller company under divcowayne ownership it was later relocated to piqua ohio meteors old hometown nearby ecto the vehicle used by the main characters in the  film ghostbusters and its  sequel is a conversion of a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance cotnerbevingtonedit divcowayne acquired cotnerbevington cb in  and it became a subsidiary of wayne corporation comet coach company was based in memphis tennessee in  the coachbuilder sold its comet trade name rights to the lincolnmercury division of ford motor company for use on the mercury version of the ford falcon in  the mercury comet was introduced starting with the  model year the former comet coach co was renamed cotnerbevington named after the two founders of the company they moved from memphis tennessee a few miles north to blytheville arkansas cb stayed in business through the  model year building only on oldsmobile automobile chassis and truckbased ambulances after about  waynes line of truckbased ambulances sentinel suburbans starting for the  model year vanguard chevrolet vans for  and medicruiser dodge vans for  were built in the blytheville facility the sentinel suburbans received a headroom increase for  but were only built through the  model year after that the sentinel brand name was used on waynes line of type i pickup chassis modular ambulances body shells were produced at the richmond indiana bus plant for careovan ambulance units based upon cutaway chassis and wayne busette body nonautomotive divisionsedit divcowayne corporation manufactured housing brands included kozy elcar star and national electronics and aerospace products were offered through dw electronics in cincinnati ohio the divcowayne conglomerate also had a financial arm divcowayne acceptance corporation which was also known as divcowayne financial wayne acceptance or financial corporation and wayne financial sales corporation new richmond factoryedit during the earlier years of the school bus industry the factory manufactured most of the parts used to assemble a bus body but it was customary for these to be shipped unassembled to body dealers around the united states and canada for assembly onto an incomplete truck chassis gradually as highway transportation of completed buses became more practical and school bus bodies became more sophisticated the assembly of complete bodies onto truck chassis in the united states and canada became centralized at locations owned by the body companies the companies often continued to ship kits overseas by the mids several other body companies notably blue bird body company and perley a thomas car works maintained assembly plants at multiple locations in the united states instead of establishing multiple assembly points in the us wayne chose to replace the overcrowded and aged wayne works facility on e street near downtown richmond with a single new plant large enough to handle both manufacturing and united states assembly due primarily to canadian import tariffs the separate canadian assembly plant welles ltd had been established and was maintained for canadian production as early as  divcowayne started plans for the construction of a new plant initially a site was selected in florence kentucky where the company purchased an option to acquire  acres  km in an industrial park the community in richmond indiana responded to the possible loss of the plant and jobs with provision of a acre  km parcel conveniently located near the intersection of interstate  and us  northwest of the city in  wayne corporation relocated from the former wayne works plant to the new site on industries road about  miles  km northwest of downtown richmond the new  million facility had  square feet  m under a single roof it featured fully modern steel manufacturing presses rustproofing equipment paint booths and could handle assembly lines for all product lines distribution networkedit more than a few wayne dealerships were operated by school bus contractors ara transportation and laidlaw were the largest others included bus and bodies of plaistow new hampshire town  country transportation of warren rhode island rohrer of duncannon pennsylvania virginia overland transportation of richmond virginia and school bus services of shawnee mission kansas these school bus contractors several of whom were also involved in contracting paratransit services found having a dealership provided both a source and an input to product design at wayne as well as a natural outlet for sale of surplus equipment at the end of contract periods breakupedit in  the divcowayne conglomerate was sold by newton glekel to boise cascade a company which was primarily seeking the housing manufacturing subsidiaries boise cascade resold wayne and its subsidiaries to indian head inc another conglomerate about the same time that divcowayne was sold to indian head the divco portion was separated and divested production of divco products continued until  wayne corporation an indian head company –edit  wayneinternational school bus retired divcowayne had formed a union and had expanded into a moderate sizedconglomerate with all facilities basically within  miles  km of waynes richmond indiana base in contrast indian head was already a large and diversified corporate conglomerate when it purchased wayne corporation and its subsidiaries in  indian head inc acquired wayne corp which its history recorded as maker of school buses ambulances hearses professional cars from divcowayne newgeneration school busesedit the late s and early s led to the development of new platforms suitable for use for small school buses additionally to improve the basic structural integrity of fullsize school buses wayne engineers went back to the drawing board and changed how school buses were constructed with an allnew body design papooseedit in the early s the principal platform for school buses smaller than conventional types but with more than  wheels was the truck chassis in widespread use for commercial delivery work the step van within the school bus body industry this type were often called p chassis in addition to wayne blue bird carpenter superior thomas and ward each developed school bus bodies based upon p chassis produced by either general motors ford or both waynes body product for the step van chassis was called the papoose the frontend of the design of the papoose was designed to afford maximum visibility and use flat glass resulting in an appearance which was not aesthetically pleasing it was described by some observers as severe and the funnylooking little bus had other nicknames even less kind in addition to its unusual appearance the wayne papoose faced another disadvantage in the wayne product line the market was highly competitive with all five other major school bus body builders participating waynes marketers wanted something more radical to differentiate a small capacity wayne product busetteedit main article wayne busette in the early s wayne designed a school bus even smaller than the papoose the busette was unique because it was one of the first school buses to be built on a cutaway van chassis previously small school buses were adaptations of fullsize vans or large suvs such as the chevrolet suburban or international travelall the busette featured dual rear wheels on the rear axle which provided extra stability and capability over conversion vehicles introduced in  the busette and its transette commercial variant would set a precedent for how all small buses are designednot just school buses the busette and transette also were among the first small buses to be fitted with wheelchair lifts lifeguardedit main article wayne lifeguard in the early s wayne was one of the first school bus manufacturers to introduce guard rails and allmetal construction into school bus design while safer than wooden body construction riveted metal body panels posed problems of their own in a crash a weak point of the body was identified as the joints where body panels were fastened together in  safety engineers at ward body works of conway arkansas a competing bus manufacturer subjected one of their school bus bodies to a multiple roll test and noted the separation at the joints ward noted that many of their competitors were using far fewer rivets and fasteners this resulted in new attention by all manufacturers to the number and quality of fasteners as opposed to simply adding more fasteners wayne engineers proposed eliminating the body panel joints entirely essentially the entire side of the bus would have to be formed from a single piece of metal the roof panel would be manufactured in the same fashion one piece cut to length fasteners would only be needed for the interior structure the guardrails and at the rear of the bus in  wayne introduced the new design branded the lifeguard although wayne needed specialized equipment to manufacture the lifeguards body panels the design also reduced overall body weight and manhours required for assembly indian head and thyssenedit in  indian head established a joint business venture with thyssenbornemisza group nv a dutch holding company in  the rest of indian head industries was sold to and folded into thyssenbornemisza a conglomerate based in monaco which was owned by one man baron hans heinrich heini thyssenbornemisza the thyssenbornemisza years –edit thyssen spent much of the next – years selling off or closing its north american investments in the late s and early s the portions of thyssenbornemisza which formed the wayne corporation went through a period of decline wayne professional cars ripedit the professional car industry was negatively and profoundly impacted by three factors in the late s at the time many units served as both ambulances and funeral vehicles called combinations combinations disappeared from general service in the late s the downsizing of americas biggest luxury cars beginning with the  model year forced major changes upon professional car builders who were dependent upon car frames purchased from general motors and ford motor company to begin their conversion processes  cadillacmillermeteor hearse customized regulatory changes at the same time changes in the federal ambulance regulations governing minimum width headroom and equipment levels generally required larger vehicles these were part of the  national ems systems act which was passed by congress in  and implemented four years later in  required that communities receiving federal funds for their programs had ambulances that met new federal specifications three design styles meet the criteria and are still in use today type i uses a ton truck chassis with a modular compartment type ii has a heavy duty van body with a raised roof type iii has a cutaway van chassis with a modular compartment passengerbased vehicles were purposely excluded from legislation and the last americanmade automobilebased ambulance was built in  change in ems providers in the early s wayne introduced a full line of noncarbased ambulances the type iii medicruiser was based on the popular dodge bseries van tradesman panel van the careovan was a type ii ambulance and the type i guardian an early version of a ton truckbased modular ambulance by the late s government standards and practical necessities were combining to make professional carbased ambulances unsuitable for virtually all ems transport work downsizing for  the cadillac commercial chassis was downsized to reduce vehicle weight and fuel consumption that year the cadillac division built  of these special lengthened units of that total only  lifeliner cadillac ambulances were manufactured by waynes millermeteor subsidiary for  cadillacs commercial chassis production further declined to only  units millermeteor received orders for only  ambulances there were no  millermeteor ambulances on december   the company with roots tracing back to  closed its doors the company laidoff  employees and terminated the contracts of their  north american distributors by the late s as the situation became critical wayne corporation the parent of mm and cb and waynes thyssen owners chose not to invest heavily in either firm as would have been required in the uncertain futures of the diverging professional car and ambulance building industries there were no buyers for either subsidiary as a going business in  cotnerbevington ambulance product line was sold to gene knisley owner of midcontinent conversion co which was an ambulance and medicar builder in kansas city missouri the cb plant in blytheville arkansas was closed a few years later the rights to the millermeteor name were acquired and resurrected by another professional car builder in norwalk ohio which in  was producing a line of funeral coaches and limousines on cadillac and lincoln chassis under the millermeteor brand name rabbitransit mpg taxiedit about the time of the  energy crisis waynes engineering department experimented with creation of a stretch conversion of the dieselpowered volkswagen rabbit the rabbitransit vehicle would have the potential to transport a large number of passengers – with very efficient fuel consumption in comparison with other automobiles the minitaxi project was dropped by wayne for potential liability reasons the frequently seen rabbitransit at the richmond plant could not be sold for highway use and it was later destroyed the end of the big sixedit in  when the ownership of wayne corporation shifted from indian head to thyssen wayne was one of six major school bus body builders in the united states wayne apparently enjoyed some profitable years in the late s buoyed by sales of its busette and transette product lines by  the company was one of the big six school bus body manufacturing companies in the united states competing with blue bird body company carpenter body works superior coach company thomas built buses inc and ward body works the big six were joined by crown coach corporation and gillig bros manufacturers which traded primarily on the west coast a downturn in north american school bus purchase volumes began in the late s as the children of the baby boom completed their elementary and secondary educations bidding competition for reduced volumes became devastating to profits and even liquidity although not publicly reported as corporate ownership under thyssen was private it is likely that wayne and welles began incurring losses around  or  and these continued into  by  wayne dealers and union leaders were told that the annual losses at waynewelles were reportedly in the millions and the thyssen owners were poised to end the relationship and financial hemorrhage in  following significant concessions by its unionized workers members of united auto workers local   which were intended to make the company more efficient wayne corporation and its canadian subsidiary welles ltd were sold by thyssen to new owners wayne corporation richmond transportation corporation –edit a new logo was adopted for wayne in the s in  richmond transportation corporation rtc was formed by jack h dekruif a corona del mar californiabased industrialist and several officers who had served at wayne for many years under the indian head and thyssen ownership rtc acquired wayne corporation and its welles subsidiary in canada in february  terry g whitesell was named president of rtc a civic leader in richmond indiana his prior responsibilities at wayne included sales marketing and purchasing over a period of more than  years whitesell was wellknown within the company its dealer and supplier networks and the industry although as industrialist investor dekruif had a track record of liquidating troubled businesses he was persuaded to allow the new organization to operate and compete several successful years followed the chaperone and chaperone ii products on cutaway van chassis did well and several wayne dealercontractors were expanding most notably laidlaw in the fall of  the company was preparing to launch an initial public stock offering ipo when black monday struck the stock market that october forcing cancellation of the ipo lifestaredit main article wayne lifestar by the late s the companys best hopes lay in its newest product a transitstyle type d school bus named the lifestar the first production versions were introduced in  featuring the same sidepanel construction as the lifeguard lifestar was to be targeted for the school bus market unlike its largest competitors wayne did not have the manufacturing equipment or capacity to build chassis inhouse consequently chassis from an outside supplier was crucial supply problems outside of the companys control led to the use of several suppliers for the lifestar over its production run richmond transportation corporation rtc declared bankruptcy in august  assets were sold by a federal bankruptcy judge at auction that fall epilogueedit main article wayne wheeled vehicles after the bankruptcy of richmond transportation corporation wayne corporation effectively ceased to exist during its liquidation the product rights and many of the assets of the company aside from the company itself and its liabilities were purchased by a subsidiary of harsco corporation reorganized as wayne wheeled vehicles wwv production of the chaperone lifeguard and lifestar were transferred to a facility in marysville ohio to supplement production of military trucks in june  after an attempted sale of the company fell through wwv was closed down by its parent company at the time of its closure wayne was in the process of launching the rd a rearengine school bus featuring innovations that would have been new to the school bus industry the rd was never massproduced some features were eventually adopted by competitive builders while initially shuttered after the closure the large richmond factory would play a key role in the future of a major competitor to wayne late in the s additionally part of the lifeguard and the busette designs were adopted by competitors as well mid busedit see also mid bus in  following the collapse of the professional car industry and growing overcapacity among school bus body manufacturers superior coach company of lima ohio was shut down by its parent company shellerglobe the next year mid bus was formed by three former superior employees along with seven coworkers they began manufacturing small school buses in a different facility in lima while fullsize buses still retained the superior name the company debuted a small bus named superior by mid bus a conversion of a fullsize van it also added a raised roof reinforced body sides and school bus windows in  the superior by mid bus name was dropped in favor of mid bus by the end of the s mid bus sought to compete with largerscale school bus manufactures the company sought expertise in developing a product based on a cutaway van in  wayne corporation discontinued busette production in favor of its newer chaperone model additionally the company was closing the welles plant in canada where busette production had been located mid bus entered into an arrangement with wayne to take over busette production in its own facility in ohiocitation needed not only did the use of an existing design lower development costs but the popularity of the busette especially among head start agencies allowed for an existing customer base crown by carpenteredit see also crown by carpenter in may  carpenter body works of mitchell indiana purchased the tooling intellectual and product rights of crown coach corporation a californiabased school bus manufacturer that had closed that year while carpenter had originally planned to restart production of the crown supercoach series ii its high cost and complexity of production would cause that proposal to be shelved in favor of its own design in  carpenter began a series of major changes within the company in order to regain lost market share to modernize its production facilities carpenter moved out of its aging facilities in mitchell indiana and leased the shuttered wayne facilities in richmond moving its corporate headquarters there by moving to the wayne facilities carpenter had the asset of combining its own team with former wayne corporation employees both the leadership and workforce based at richmond included a number of veterans of the former wayne operations there as such they brought considerable experience and knowledge of the plant and industry to the effort nevertheless major outside forces still to be faced were a supply of suitable chassis and the overcapacity of the body industry as part of the move carpenter unveiled major changes for its  product line on the outside the body now wore fulllength guard rails above the wheels under the skin the body was redesigned with singlepiece roof bows new welding procedures allowed by the equipment at richmond strengthened roof joints unlike a crucial structural flaw later found in mitchellproduced buses inside the bus wayne tooling was used to update certain areas of the carpenter buses on conventional buses carpenter reused the driver control panel and windshield from the wayne lifeguard all fullsize buses would use wayne entry doors the company considered the transformation so extensive that it changed its name and company logo resurrecting the first half of the crown coach name carpenter was now known as crown by carpenter and used its own version of a logo introduced by crown coach in the late s in an effort to further diversify its product line outside of school buses the company introduced a delivery truck loosely based on its cadet bus products in  carpenter was acquired by one of its largest chassis suppliers spartan motors of charlotte michigan spartan motors was a chassis supplier known for highmargin lowvolume markets some examples include chassis for fire apparatus and luxury motorhomes spartan was a supplier for certain models of the blue bird wanderlodge for example during the economic times around the millennium lower initial capital costs for school buses seemed to trump their longevity when it was time for purchasing decisions financially pressed districts and contractors tended to select cheaper products with short life cycles this was much the same dilemma faced by wayne wheeled vehicles parent company harscobmy where a lesser quantity of higher quality products at a correspondingly higher price had also been the plants historical output carpenter had been struggling for almost  years when it too finally ended school bus production in  spartan by then a ⅔ owner did not see a solution to the market dilemma and felt the projected continued losses would exceed the value to their business plan voting to end the venture future of the plantedit this article needs to be updated please update

overviewedit wayne is a name in school transportation that predates the familiar yellow school bus seen all over the united states and canada beginning in the th century craftsmen in richmond indiana at wayne works and its successors built horsedrawn vehicles including kid hacks evolving into automobiles and virtually all types of bus bodies during the th century wayne products eventually included school buses transit buses highway coaches military and shuttle buses ambulances and even huge bus bodies pulled by tractor trailers used to haul oil field workers in the middle east among many innovations wayne pioneered the guard rails on the sides of all school buses today inboard wheelchair lifts and even highheadroom doors a special accommodation for mobilitychallenged persons requiring head and neck support from above the company was the first with a school bus based upon a cutaway van chassis the wayne busette a chassis design which more than  years later remains one of the most popular in use in north american markets the crowning safety achievement was the wayne lifeguard structural design introduced in  which featured continuous interior and exterior longitudinal panels the lifeguards design helped pave the way for the allimportant us federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss for school buses most of which became applicable on april   in the years after wayne continued to be a leader in bus safety engineering wayne went through many owners during the second half of the th century the business underwent periods under the ownership of divco as divcowayne boise cascade indian head inc and the thyssenbornemisza group it moved to a greatly expanded facility adjacent to interstate  in  where it became a familiar landmark to millions of travelers after encountering a difficult market cycle and industry downturn due to overcapacity beginning in the early s wayne corporation finally closed in  several efforts to continue to utilize portions of the assets and build school buses ended in  as of  thousands of wayne buses remained in service although the numbers are dwindling each year as new buses replace them in school and commercial operations some have been converted to motor homes and other uses the former wayne corporation property along interstate  is becoming reutilized for a number of retail and industrial enterprises early historyedit after starting out as wayne agricultural works in dublin indiana in the mid th century all manufacturing was centralized at richmond indiana most bus bodies consisted of inhouse manufactured parts and purchased components manufactured by others combined into bus bodies in assembly operations thus the major two functions of the richmond indiana plant were manufacturing of parts and assembly wayne bus bodies were also assembled at multiple locations of truck body dealers around the us and at a canadian assembly plant welles ltd in windsor ontario kits were also shipped overseas even after all north american assembly was eventually centralized in richmond indiana and windsor ontario in the early s kid hacksedit a  ford model t kid hackbus body manufacturer unknown by combining the kid hack wagon body with an automotive chassis wayne works helped create the school bus in its earliest form waynes predecessor wayne works was founded in the united states of america in  wayne works began by making horsedrawn vehicles by  and possibly earlier it is known that wayne works was making horsedrawn school carriages which many people referred to as school hacks school cars school trucks or kid hacks as education in the united states shifted from small one room schools to fewer but larger multiroom schools fewer children lived within walking distances initially as many students who needed transportation lived in rural areas the need was filled by adapted farm vehicles soon these practices and operations evolved and expanded into todays school transportation systems beginning in the early s through the s several automobile designers and manufacturers were located in richmond among the automobiles manufactured there was the richmond which was built by the wayne works the rodefeld and the crosley the wayne county historical museum in richmond indiana has a rare  richmond on display along with horsedrawn kid hack also manufactured by the wayne works first busesedit according to several sources in  wayne works mounted a wooden kid hack onto an automobile chassis creating a predecessor to the modern motor school bus in the vehicle bodies for school transportation that the company produced during this era passengers sat on perimeter seating facing the sides rather than the front of the bus entry and egress was through a door at the rear a design begun in nonmotorized days to help avoiding startling the horses this feature was retained becoming the rear emergency exit seen on todays buses the primary mode of ingressegress was now through a curbside door safety innovationsedit by  wayne works was building allsteel bus bodies in the following few years the school bus bodies began to include a group of heavyduty collision rails or guard rails as an added safety feature wayne works was one of the earliest school bus companies to offer glass in place of the standard canvas curtains in the passenger area glass did not become a common feature until the s although not the first to introduce the type in the s wayne works was among the first manufacturers to produce transitstyle school buses a body with a more or less flat frontend design initial production of waynes forward control bus bodies were conversions of conventional bus chassis however the conventional design with a cowled chassis known as type c on modern school buses would be the bulk of waynes sales until production ended in  world war ii – wooden bodies and trailer busesedit to conserve steel for war use wayne works and other manufacturers reverted from allsteel construction to building some bus bodies with wooden components during world war ii the company also developed trailertype bodies for military use which could transport up to  passengers pulled by a truck thousands of military ambulance bodies were also produced the company also did some reconstruction on older buses and trucks to extend their lives during the war years as did other bus body manufacturers in  as the end of world war ii approached wayne returned to building allsteel bodies welles canadian bus assemblyedit welles corporation in windsor ontario was named for halsey v welles who founded h v welles ltd in  originally named warford corp of canada it was first established to distribute warford transmissions expanding into aftermarket products primarily for ford trucks in  welles corp became the sole canadian distributor of wayne works school buses in  under new yorkbased financier newton glekel divcowayne acquired welles corp ltd and incorporated it as a new subsidiary division of divcowayne diversificationedit wayne works began to diversify into other fields besides bus production through several acquisitions in the mids these acquisitions primarily brought wayne into the world of professional car production the company purchased meteor motor car company in piqua ohio in  meteor built professional cars such as limousines and ambulances two years later in  wayne acquired aj millers professional car building company of bellefontaine ohio the aj miller company had begun in  by making horse carriages and then started making automobiles in the early part of the th century however the small company found it could not compete with the larger automobile makers so they began specializing in hearses and ambulances over the years the miller hearses became known and used throughout the world the miller co was combined with waynes existing professional car subsidiary meteor motor car company forming the new millermeteor mm division of wayne the  companies competed in  but were doing business as a combination by  divcowayne corporation –edit in  under the leadership of newton glekel divco corporation bought the wayne works a school bus builder in richmond indiana and renamed itself divcowayne corporation divcowayne also known as dw was a conglomerate involved in the manufacturing of trucks school buses hearses ambulances and mobile homes and apparently also had had an electronics section involved in aerospace technology divcoedit main article divco divco delivery truck divco stands for detroit industrial vehicles company founded in  divco was known for its pioneering delivery vehicles especially milk trucks from  to  divco produced multistop delivery trucks only the vw beetle stayed in production with the same basic model for a longer period of time divco trucks have become popular collectible vehicles today during the divcowayne era the truck manufacturing of divcowayne continued to be through the former divco portion some divco trucks were modified with seats and windows from the wayne works to produce a divco dividend bus very few of these units were built between  and  virtually all bus and ambulance manufacturing was through the wayne corporation portion of divcowayne and subsidiary units millermeteor and cotnerbevington exportedit wayne export was another division which specialized in selling disassembled wayne bodies knockdown kits ckds outside north america by  wayne bus bodies were in use in  different countries in  wayne licensed the spanish sa bosuga to build in barcelona coach bodies based on waynes technology and designs these were marketed as bosuga wayne utilizing mainly pegaso and barreirosaec chassis the venture was shortlived since the spanish market for coach bodies was crowded other productsedit during the late s and early s the divcowayne conglomerate would diversify its product lines entering vehicle segments far removed from divco delivery vehicles and wayne school buses in addition the conglomerate expanded into various nonautomotive products professional carsedit the professional car quoted from a leading trade association is loosely defined as a custombodied vehicle based on passenger car styling and used in the funeral rescue or livery services such vehicles may be hearses flower cars service cars ambulances limousines or cars specially built to combine two or more of these different functions such as combination hearseambulances sedan ambulances or invalid coaches using vehicles such as the cadillac commercial chassis as a donor vehicle the bodywork including the roof glass and doors was completed by coachbuilders from the dashboard rearward nearly all exterior and interior bodywork was manufactured by hand by  professional and combination cars became obsolete as general motors and ford downsized their fullsize automobiles while funeral cars remained based on automobiles ambulances were shifted to vanbased chassis millermeteoredit wayne professional cars a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance professional car manufacturers miller and meteor newly combined as millermeteor were brought into the fold of divcowayne as the newly formed conglomerate was developing its opportunities in this field although the recently combined millermeteor company was initially based at bellefontaine ohio originally the home of the aj miller company under divcowayne ownership it was later relocated to piqua ohio meteors old hometown nearby ecto the vehicle used by the main characters in the  film ghostbusters and its  sequel is a conversion of a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance cotnerbevingtonedit divcowayne acquired cotnerbevington cb in  and it became a subsidiary of wayne corporation comet coach company was based in memphis tennessee in  the coachbuilder sold its comet trade name rights to the lincolnmercury division of ford motor company for use on the mercury version of the ford falcon in  the mercury comet was introduced starting with the  model year the former comet coach co was renamed cotnerbevington named after the two founders of the company they moved from memphis tennessee a few miles north to blytheville arkansas cb stayed in business through the  model year building only on oldsmobile automobile chassis and truckbased ambulances after about  waynes line of truckbased ambulances sentinel suburbans starting for the  model year vanguard chevrolet vans for  and medicruiser dodge vans for  were built in the blytheville facility the sentinel suburbans received a headroom increase for  but were only built through the  model year after that the sentinel brand name was used on waynes line of type i pickup chassis modular ambulances body shells were produced at the richmond indiana bus plant for careovan ambulance units based upon cutaway chassis and wayne busette body nonautomotive divisionsedit divcowayne corporation manufactured housing brands included kozy elcar star and national electronics and aerospace products were offered through dw electronics in cincinnati ohio the divcowayne conglomerate also had a financial arm divcowayne acceptance corporation which was also known as divcowayne financial wayne acceptance or financial corporation and wayne financial sales corporation new richmond factoryedit during the earlier years of the school bus industry the factory manufactured most of the parts used to assemble a bus body but it was customary for these to be shipped unassembled to body dealers around the united states and canada for assembly onto an incomplete truck chassis gradually as highway transportation of completed buses became more practical and school bus bodies became more sophisticated the assembly of complete bodies onto truck chassis in the united states and canada became centralized at locations owned by the body companies the companies often continued to ship kits overseas by the mids several other body companies notably blue bird body company and perley a thomas car works maintained assembly plants at multiple locations in the united states instead of establishing multiple assembly points in the us wayne chose to replace the overcrowded and aged wayne works facility on e street near downtown richmond with a single new plant large enough to handle both manufacturing and united states assembly due primarily to canadian import tariffs the separate canadian assembly plant welles ltd had been established and was maintained for canadian production as early as  divcowayne started plans for the construction of a new plant initially a site was selected in florence kentucky where the company purchased an option to acquire  acres  km in an industrial park the community in richmond indiana responded to the possible loss of the plant and jobs with provision of a acre  km parcel conveniently located near the intersection of interstate  and us  northwest of the city in  wayne corporation relocated from the former wayne works plant to the new site on industries road about  miles  km northwest of downtown richmond the new  million facility had  square feet  m under a single roof it featured fully modern steel manufacturing presses rustproofing equipment paint booths and could handle assembly lines for all product lines distribution networkedit more than a few wayne dealerships were operated by school bus contractors ara transportation and laidlaw were the largest others included bus and bodies of plaistow new hampshire town  country transportation of warren rhode island rohrer of duncannon pennsylvania virginia overland transportation of richmond virginia and school bus services of shawnee mission kansas these school bus contractors several of whom were also involved in contracting paratransit services found having a dealership provided both a source and an input to product design at wayne as well as a natural outlet for sale of surplus equipment at the end of contract periods breakupedit in  the divcowayne conglomerate was sold by newton glekel to boise cascade a company which was primarily seeking the housing manufacturing subsidiaries boise cascade resold wayne and its subsidiaries to indian head inc another conglomerate about the same time that divcowayne was sold to indian head the divco portion was separated and divested production of divco products continued until  wayne corporation an indian head company –edit  wayneinternational school bus retired divcowayne had formed a union and had expanded into a moderate sizedconglomerate with all facilities basically within  miles  km of waynes richmond indiana base in contrast indian head was already a large and diversified corporate conglomerate when it purchased wayne corporation and its subsidiaries in  indian head inc acquired wayne corp which its history recorded as maker of school buses ambulances hearses professional cars from divcowayne newgeneration school busesedit the late s and early s led to the development of new platforms suitable for use for small school buses additionally to improve the basic structural integrity of fullsize school buses wayne engineers went back to the drawing board and changed how school buses were constructed with an allnew body design papooseedit in the early s the principal platform for school buses smaller than conventional types but with more than  wheels was the truck chassis in widespread use for commercial delivery work the step van within the school bus body industry this type were often called p chassis in addition to wayne blue bird carpenter superior thomas and ward each developed school bus bodies based upon p chassis produced by either general motors ford or both waynes body product for the step van chassis was called the papoose the frontend of the design of the papoose was designed to afford maximum visibility and use flat glass resulting in an appearance which was not aesthetically pleasing it was described by some observers as severe and the funnylooking little bus had other nicknames even less kind in addition to its unusual appearance the wayne papoose faced another disadvantage in the wayne product line the market was highly competitive with all five other major school bus body builders participating waynes marketers wanted something more radical to differentiate a small capacity wayne product busetteedit main article wayne busette in the early s wayne designed a school bus even smaller than the papoose the busette was unique because it was one of the first school buses to be built on a cutaway van chassis previously small school buses were adaptations of fullsize vans or large suvs such as the chevrolet suburban or international travelall the busette featured dual rear wheels on the rear axle which provided extra stability and capability over conversion vehicles introduced in  the busette and its transette commercial variant would set a precedent for how all small buses are designednot just school buses the busette and transette also were among the first small buses to be fitted with wheelchair lifts lifeguardedit main article wayne lifeguard in the early s wayne was one of the first school bus manufacturers to introduce guard rails and allmetal construction into school bus design while safer than wooden body construction riveted metal body panels posed problems of their own in a crash a weak point of the body was identified as the joints where body panels were fastened together in  safety engineers at ward body works of conway arkansas a competing bus manufacturer subjected one of their school bus bodies to a multiple roll test and noted the separation at the joints ward noted that many of their competitors were using far fewer rivets and fasteners this resulted in new attention by all manufacturers to the number and quality of fasteners as opposed to simply adding more fasteners wayne engineers proposed eliminating the body panel joints entirely essentially the entire side of the bus would have to be formed from a single piece of metal the roof panel would be manufactured in the same fashion one piece cut to length fasteners would only be needed for the interior structure the guardrails and at the rear of the bus in  wayne introduced the new design branded the lifeguard although wayne needed specialized equipment to manufacture the lifeguards body panels the design also reduced overall body weight and manhours required for assembly indian head and thyssenedit in  indian head established a joint business venture with thyssenbornemisza group nv a dutch holding company in  the rest of indian head industries was sold to and folded into thyssenbornemisza a conglomerate based in monaco which was owned by one man baron hans heinrich heini thyssenbornemisza the thyssenbornemisza years –edit thyssen spent much of the next – years selling off or closing its north american investments in the late s and early s the portions of thyssenbornemisza which formed the wayne corporation went through a period of decline wayne professional cars ripedit the professional car industry was negatively and profoundly impacted by three factors in the late s at the time many units served as both ambulances and funeral vehicles called combinations combinations disappeared from general service in the late s the downsizing of americas biggest luxury cars beginning with the  model year forced major changes upon professional car builders who were dependent upon car frames purchased from general motors and ford motor company to begin their conversion processes  cadillacmillermeteor hearse customized regulatory changes at the same time changes in the federal ambulance regulations governing minimum width headroom and equipment levels generally required larger vehicles these were part of the  national ems systems act which was passed by congress in  and implemented four years later in  required that communities receiving federal funds for their programs had ambulances that met new federal specifications three design styles meet the criteria and are still in use today type i uses a ton truck chassis with a modular compartment type ii has a heavy duty van body with a raised roof type iii has a cutaway van chassis with a modular compartment passengerbased vehicles were purposely excluded from legislation and the last americanmade automobilebased ambulance was built in  change in ems providers in the early s wayne introduced a full line of noncarbased ambulances the type iii medicruiser was based on the popular dodge bseries van tradesman panel van the careovan was a type ii ambulance and the type i guardian an early version of a ton truckbased modular ambulance by the late s government standards and practical necessities were combining to make professional carbased ambulances unsuitable for virtually all ems transport work downsizing for  the cadillac commercial chassis was downsized to reduce vehicle weight and fuel consumption that year the cadillac division built  of these special lengthened units of that total only  lifeliner cadillac ambulances were manufactured by waynes millermeteor subsidiary for  cadillacs commercial chassis production further declined to only  units millermeteor received orders for only  ambulances there were no  millermeteor ambulances on december   the company with roots tracing back to  closed its doors the company laidoff  employees and terminated the contracts of their  north american distributors by the late s as the situation became critical wayne corporation the parent of mm and cb and waynes thyssen owners chose not to invest heavily in either firm as would have been required in the uncertain futures of the diverging professional car and ambulance building industries there were no buyers for either subsidiary as a going business in  cotnerbevington ambulance product line was sold to gene knisley owner of midcontinent conversion co which was an ambulance and medicar builder in kansas city missouri the cb plant in blytheville arkansas was closed a few years later the rights to the millermeteor name were acquired and resurrected by another professional car builder in norwalk ohio which in  was producing a line of funeral coaches and limousines on cadillac and lincoln chassis under the millermeteor brand name rabbitransit mpg taxiedit about the time of the  energy crisis waynes engineering department experimented with creation of a stretch conversion of the dieselpowered volkswagen rabbit the rabbitransit vehicle would have the potential to transport a large number of passengers – with very efficient fuel consumption in comparison with other automobiles the minitaxi project was dropped by wayne for potential liability reasons the frequently seen rabbitransit at the richmond plant could not be sold for highway use and it was later destroyed the end of the big sixedit in  when the ownership of wayne corporation shifted from indian head to thyssen wayne was one of six major school bus body builders in the united states wayne apparently enjoyed some profitable years in the late s buoyed by sales of its busette and transette product lines by  the company was one of the big six school bus body manufacturing companies in the united states competing with blue bird body company carpenter body works superior coach company thomas built buses inc and ward body works the big six were joined by crown coach corporation and gillig bros manufacturers which traded primarily on the west coast a downturn in north american school bus purchase volumes began in the late s as the children of the baby boom completed their elementary and secondary educations bidding competition for reduced volumes became devastating to profits and even liquidity although not publicly reported as corporate ownership under thyssen was private it is likely that wayne and welles began incurring losses around  or  and these continued into  by  wayne dealers and union leaders were told that the annual losses at waynewelles were reportedly in the millions and the thyssen owners were poised to end the relationship and financial hemorrhage in  following significant concessions by its unionized workers members of united auto workers local   which were intended to make the company more efficient wayne corporation and its canadian subsidiary welles ltd were sold by thyssen to new owners wayne corporation richmond transportation corporation –edit a new logo was adopted for wayne in the s in  richmond transportation corporation rtc was formed by jack h dekruif a corona del mar californiabased industrialist and several officers who had served at wayne for many years under the indian head and thyssen ownership rtc acquired wayne corporation and its welles subsidiary in canada in february  terry g whitesell was named president of rtc a civic leader in richmond indiana his prior responsibilities at wayne included sales marketing and purchasing over a period of more than  years whitesell was wellknown within the company its dealer and supplier networks and the industry although as industrialist investor dekruif had a track record of liquidating troubled businesses he was persuaded to allow the new organization to operate and compete several successful years followed the chaperone and chaperone ii products on cutaway van chassis did well and several wayne dealercontractors were expanding most notably laidlaw in the fall of  the company was preparing to launch an initial public stock offering ipo when black monday struck the stock market that october forcing cancellation of the ipo lifestaredit main article wayne lifestar by the late s the companys best hopes lay in its newest product a transitstyle type d school bus named the lifestar the first production versions were introduced in  featuring the same sidepanel construction as the lifeguard lifestar was to be targeted for the school bus market unlike its largest competitors wayne did not have the manufacturing equipment or capacity to build chassis inhouse consequently chassis from an outside supplier was crucial supply problems outside of the companys control led to the use of several suppliers for the lifestar over its production run richmond transportation corporation rtc declared bankruptcy in august  assets were sold by a federal bankruptcy judge at auction that fall epilogueedit main article wayne wheeled vehicles after the bankruptcy of richmond transportation corporation wayne corporation effectively ceased to exist during its liquidation the product rights and many of the assets of the company aside from the company itself and its liabilities were purchased by a subsidiary of harsco corporation reorganized as wayne wheeled vehicles wwv production of the chaperone lifeguard and lifestar were transferred to a facility in marysville ohio to supplement production of military trucks in june  after an attempted sale of the company fell through wwv was closed down by its parent company at the time of its closure wayne was in the process of launching the rd a rearengine school bus featuring innovations that would have been new to the school bus industry the rd was never massproduced some features were eventually adopted by competitive builders while initially shuttered after the closure the large richmond factory would play a key role in the future of a major competitor to wayne late in the s additionally part of the lifeguard and the busette designs were adopted by competitors as well mid busedit see also mid bus in  following the collapse of the professional car industry and growing overcapacity among school bus body manufacturers superior coach company of lima ohio was shut down by its parent company shellerglobe the next year mid bus was formed by three former superior employees along with seven coworkers they began manufacturing small school buses in a different facility in lima while fullsize buses still retained the superior name the company debuted a small bus named superior by mid bus a conversion of a fullsize van it also added a raised roof reinforced body sides and school bus windows in  the superior by mid bus name was dropped in favor of mid bus by the end of the s mid bus sought to compete with largerscale school bus manufactures the company sought expertise in developing a product based on a cutaway van in  wayne corporation discontinued busette production in favor of its newer chaperone model additionally the company was closing the welles plant in canada where busette production had been located mid bus entered into an arrangement with wayne to take over busette production in its own facility in ohiocitation needed not only did the use of an existing design lower development costs but the popularity of the busette especially among head start agencies allowed for an existing customer base crown by carpenteredit see also crown by carpenter in may  carpenter body works of mitchell indiana purchased the tooling intellectual and product rights of crown coach corporation a californiabased school bus manufacturer that had closed that year while carpenter had originally planned to restart production of the crown supercoach series ii its high cost and complexity of production would cause that proposal to be shelved in favor of its own design in  carpenter began a series of major changes within the company in order to regain lost market share to modernize its production facilities carpenter moved out of its aging facilities in mitchell indiana and leased the shuttered wayne facilities in richmond moving its corporate headquarters there by moving to the wayne facilities carpenter had the asset of combining its own team with former wayne corporation employees both the leadership and workforce based at richmond included a number of veterans of the former wayne operations there as such they brought considerable experience and knowledge of the plant and industry to the effort nevertheless major outside forces still to be faced were a supply of suitable chassis and the overcapacity of the body industry as part of the move carpenter unveiled major changes for its  product line on the outside the body now wore fulllength guard rails above the wheels under the skin the body was redesigned with singlepiece roof bows new welding procedures allowed by the equipment at richmond strengthened roof joints unlike a crucial structural flaw later found in mitchellproduced buses inside the bus wayne tooling was used to update certain areas of the carpenter buses on conventional buses carpenter reused the driver control panel and windshield from the wayne lifeguard all fullsize buses would use wayne entry doors the company considered the transformation so extensive that it changed its name and company logo resurrecting the first half of the crown coach name carpenter was now known as crown by carpenter and used its own version of a logo introduced by crown coach in the late s in an effort to further diversify its product line outside of school buses the company introduced a delivery truck loosely based on its cadet bus products in  carpenter was acquired by one of its largest chassis suppliers spartan motors of charlotte michigan spartan motors was a chassis supplier known for highmargin lowvolume markets some examples include chassis for fire apparatus and luxury motorhomes spartan was a supplier for certain models of the blue bird wanderlodge for example during the economic times around the millennium lower initial capital costs for school buses seemed to trump their longevity when it was time for purchasing decisions financially pressed districts and contractors tended to select cheaper products with short life cycles this was much the same dilemma faced by wayne wheeled vehicles parent company harscobmy where a lesser quantity of higher quality products at a correspondingly higher price had also been the plants historical output carpenter had been struggling for almost  years when it too finally ended school bus production in  spartan by then a ⅔ owner did not see a solution to the market dilemma and felt the projected continued losses would exceed the value to their business plan voting to end the venture future of the plantedit this article needs to be updated please update

overviewedit wayne is a name in school transportation that predates the familiar yellow school bus seen all over the united states and canada beginning in the th century craftsmen in richmond indiana at wayne works and its successors built horsedrawn vehicles including kid hacks evolving into automobiles and virtually all types of bus bodies during the th century wayne products eventually included school buses transit buses highway coaches military and shuttle buses ambulances and even huge bus bodies pulled by tractor trailers used to haul oil field workers in the middle east among many innovations wayne pioneered the guard rails on the sides of all school buses today inboard wheelchair lifts and even highheadroom doors a special accommodation for mobilitychallenged persons requiring head and neck support from above the company was the first with a school bus based upon a cutaway van chassis the wayne busette a chassis design which more than  years later remains one of the most popular in use in north american markets the crowning safety achievement was the wayne lifeguard structural design introduced in  which featured continuous interior and exterior longitudinal panels the lifeguards design helped pave the way for the allimportant us federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss for school buses most of which became applicable on april   in the years after wayne continued to be a leader in bus safety engineering wayne went through many owners during the second half of the th century the business underwent periods under the ownership of divco as divcowayne boise cascade indian head inc and the thyssenbornemisza group it moved to a greatly expanded facility adjacent to interstate  in  where it became a familiar landmark to millions of travelers after encountering a difficult market cycle and industry downturn due to overcapacity beginning in the early s wayne corporation finally closed in  several efforts to continue to utilize portions of the assets and build school buses ended in  as of  thousands of wayne buses remained in service although the numbers are dwindling each year as new buses replace them in school and commercial operations some have been converted to motor homes and other uses the former wayne corporation property along interstate  is becoming reutilized for a number of retail and industrial enterprises early historyedit after starting out as wayne agricultural works in dublin indiana in the mid th century all manufacturing was centralized at richmond indiana most bus bodies consisted of inhouse manufactured parts and purchased components manufactured by others combined into bus bodies in assembly operations thus the major two functions of the richmond indiana plant were manufacturing of parts and assembly wayne bus bodies were also assembled at multiple locations of truck body dealers around the us and at a canadian assembly plant welles ltd in windsor ontario kits were also shipped overseas even after all north american assembly was eventually centralized in richmond indiana and windsor ontario in the early s kid hacksedit a  ford model t kid hackbus body manufacturer unknown by combining the kid hack wagon body with an automotive chassis wayne works helped create the school bus in its earliest form waynes predecessor wayne works was founded in the united states of america in  wayne works began by making horsedrawn vehicles by  and possibly earlier it is known that wayne works was making horsedrawn school carriages which many people referred to as school hacks school cars school trucks or kid hacks as education in the united states shifted from small one room schools to fewer but larger multiroom schools fewer children lived within walking distances initially as many students who needed transportation lived in rural areas the need was filled by adapted farm vehicles soon these practices and operations evolved and expanded into todays school transportation systems beginning in the early s through the s several automobile designers and manufacturers were located in richmond among the automobiles manufactured there was the richmond which was built by the wayne works the rodefeld and the crosley the wayne county historical museum in richmond indiana has a rare  richmond on display along with horsedrawn kid hack also manufactured by the wayne works first busesedit according to several sources in  wayne works mounted a wooden kid hack onto an automobile chassis creating a predecessor to the modern motor school bus in the vehicle bodies for school transportation that the company produced during this era passengers sat on perimeter seating facing the sides rather than the front of the bus entry and egress was through a door at the rear a design begun in nonmotorized days to help avoiding startling the horses this feature was retained becoming the rear emergency exit seen on todays buses the primary mode of ingressegress was now through a curbside door safety innovationsedit by  wayne works was building allsteel bus bodies in the following few years the school bus bodies began to include a group of heavyduty collision rails or guard rails as an added safety feature wayne works was one of the earliest school bus companies to offer glass in place of the standard canvas curtains in the passenger area glass did not become a common feature until the s although not the first to introduce the type in the s wayne works was among the first manufacturers to produce transitstyle school buses a body with a more or less flat frontend design initial production of waynes forward control bus bodies were conversions of conventional bus chassis however the conventional design with a cowled chassis known as type c on modern school buses would be the bulk of waynes sales until production ended in  world war ii – wooden bodies and trailer busesedit to conserve steel for war use wayne works and other manufacturers reverted from allsteel construction to building some bus bodies with wooden components during world war ii the company also developed trailertype bodies for military use which could transport up to  passengers pulled by a truck thousands of military ambulance bodies were also produced the company also did some reconstruction on older buses and trucks to extend their lives during the war years as did other bus body manufacturers in  as the end of world war ii approached wayne returned to building allsteel bodies welles canadian bus assemblyedit welles corporation in windsor ontario was named for halsey v welles who founded h v welles ltd in  originally named warford corp of canada it was first established to distribute warford transmissions expanding into aftermarket products primarily for ford trucks in  welles corp became the sole canadian distributor of wayne works school buses in  under new yorkbased financier newton glekel divcowayne acquired welles corp ltd and incorporated it as a new subsidiary division of divcowayne diversificationedit wayne works began to diversify into other fields besides bus production through several acquisitions in the mids these acquisitions primarily brought wayne into the world of professional car production the company purchased meteor motor car company in piqua ohio in  meteor built professional cars such as limousines and ambulances two years later in  wayne acquired aj millers professional car building company of bellefontaine ohio the aj miller company had begun in  by making horse carriages and then started making automobiles in the early part of the th century however the small company found it could not compete with the larger automobile makers so they began specializing in hearses and ambulances over the years the miller hearses became known and used throughout the world the miller co was combined with waynes existing professional car subsidiary meteor motor car company forming the new millermeteor mm division of wayne the  companies competed in  but were doing business as a combination by  divcowayne corporation –edit in  under the leadership of newton glekel divco corporation bought the wayne works a school bus builder in richmond indiana and renamed itself divcowayne corporation divcowayne also known as dw was a conglomerate involved in the manufacturing of trucks school buses hearses ambulances and mobile homes and apparently also had had an electronics section involved in aerospace technology divcoedit main article divco divco delivery truck divco stands for detroit industrial vehicles company founded in  divco was known for its pioneering delivery vehicles especially milk trucks from  to  divco produced multistop delivery trucks only the vw beetle stayed in production with the same basic model for a longer period of time divco trucks have become popular collectible vehicles today during the divcowayne era the truck manufacturing of divcowayne continued to be through the former divco portion some divco trucks were modified with seats and windows from the wayne works to produce a divco dividend bus very few of these units were built between  and  virtually all bus and ambulance manufacturing was through the wayne corporation portion of divcowayne and subsidiary units millermeteor and cotnerbevington exportedit wayne export was another division which specialized in selling disassembled wayne bodies knockdown kits ckds outside north america by  wayne bus bodies were in use in  different countries in  wayne licensed the spanish sa bosuga to build in barcelona coach bodies based on waynes technology and designs these were marketed as bosuga wayne utilizing mainly pegaso and barreirosaec chassis the venture was shortlived since the spanish market for coach bodies was crowded other productsedit during the late s and early s the divcowayne conglomerate would diversify its product lines entering vehicle segments far removed from divco delivery vehicles and wayne school buses in addition the conglomerate expanded into various nonautomotive products professional carsedit the professional car quoted from a leading trade association is loosely defined as a custombodied vehicle based on passenger car styling and used in the funeral rescue or livery services such vehicles may be hearses flower cars service cars ambulances limousines or cars specially built to combine two or more of these different functions such as combination hearseambulances sedan ambulances or invalid coaches using vehicles such as the cadillac commercial chassis as a donor vehicle the bodywork including the roof glass and doors was completed by coachbuilders from the dashboard rearward nearly all exterior and interior bodywork was manufactured by hand by  professional and combination cars became obsolete as general motors and ford downsized their fullsize automobiles while funeral cars remained based on automobiles ambulances were shifted to vanbased chassis millermeteoredit wayne professional cars a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance professional car manufacturers miller and meteor newly combined as millermeteor were brought into the fold of divcowayne as the newly formed conglomerate was developing its opportunities in this field although the recently combined millermeteor company was initially based at bellefontaine ohio originally the home of the aj miller company under divcowayne ownership it was later relocated to piqua ohio meteors old hometown nearby ecto the vehicle used by the main characters in the  film ghostbusters and its  sequel is a conversion of a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance cotnerbevingtonedit divcowayne acquired cotnerbevington cb in  and it became a subsidiary of wayne corporation comet coach company was based in memphis tennessee in  the coachbuilder sold its comet trade name rights to the lincolnmercury division of ford motor company for use on the mercury version of the ford falcon in  the mercury comet was introduced starting with the  model year the former comet coach co was renamed cotnerbevington named after the two founders of the company they moved from memphis tennessee a few miles north to blytheville arkansas cb stayed in business through the  model year building only on oldsmobile automobile chassis and truckbased ambulances after about  waynes line of truckbased ambulances sentinel suburbans starting for the  model year vanguard chevrolet vans for  and medicruiser dodge vans for  were built in the blytheville facility the sentinel suburbans received a headroom increase for  but were only built through the  model year after that the sentinel brand name was used on waynes line of type i pickup chassis modular ambulances body shells were produced at the richmond indiana bus plant for careovan ambulance units based upon cutaway chassis and wayne busette body nonautomotive divisionsedit divcowayne corporation manufactured housing brands included kozy elcar star and national electronics and aerospace products were offered through dw electronics in cincinnati ohio the divcowayne conglomerate also had a financial arm divcowayne acceptance corporation which was also known as divcowayne financial wayne acceptance or financial corporation and wayne financial sales corporation new richmond factoryedit during the earlier years of the school bus industry the factory manufactured most of the parts used to assemble a bus body but it was customary for these to be shipped unassembled to body dealers around the united states and canada for assembly onto an incomplete truck chassis gradually as highway transportation of completed buses became more practical and school bus bodies became more sophisticated the assembly of complete bodies onto truck chassis in the united states and canada became centralized at locations owned by the body companies the companies often continued to ship kits overseas by the mids several other body companies notably blue bird body company and perley a thomas car works maintained assembly plants at multiple locations in the united states instead of establishing multiple assembly points in the us wayne chose to replace the overcrowded and aged wayne works facility on e street near downtown richmond with a single new plant large enough to handle both manufacturing and united states assembly due primarily to canadian import tariffs the separate canadian assembly plant welles ltd had been established and was maintained for canadian production as early as  divcowayne started plans for the construction of a new plant initially a site was selected in florence kentucky where the company purchased an option to acquire  acres  km in an industrial park the community in richmond indiana responded to the possible loss of the plant and jobs with provision of a acre  km parcel conveniently located near the intersection of interstate  and us  northwest of the city in  wayne corporation relocated from the former wayne works plant to the new site on industries road about  miles  km northwest of downtown richmond the new  million facility had  square feet  m under a single roof it featured fully modern steel manufacturing presses rustproofing equipment paint booths and could handle assembly lines for all product lines distribution networkedit more than a few wayne dealerships were operated by school bus contractors ara transportation and laidlaw were the largest others included bus and bodies of plaistow new hampshire town  country transportation of warren rhode island rohrer of duncannon pennsylvania virginia overland transportation of richmond virginia and school bus services of shawnee mission kansas these school bus contractors several of whom were also involved in contracting paratransit services found having a dealership provided both a source and an input to product design at wayne as well as a natural outlet for sale of surplus equipment at the end of contract periods breakupedit in  the divcowayne conglomerate was sold by newton glekel to boise cascade a company which was primarily seeking the housing manufacturing subsidiaries boise cascade resold wayne and its subsidiaries to indian head inc another conglomerate about the same time that divcowayne was sold to indian head the divco portion was separated and divested production of divco products continued until  wayne corporation an indian head company –edit  wayneinternational school bus retired divcowayne had formed a union and had expanded into a moderate sizedconglomerate with all facilities basically within  miles  km of waynes richmond indiana base in contrast indian head was already a large and diversified corporate conglomerate when it purchased wayne corporation and its subsidiaries in  indian head inc acquired wayne corp which its history recorded as maker of school buses ambulances hearses professional cars from divcowayne newgeneration school busesedit the late s and early s led to the development of new platforms suitable for use for small school buses additionally to improve the basic structural integrity of fullsize school buses wayne engineers went back to the drawing board and changed how school buses were constructed with an allnew body design papooseedit in the early s the principal platform for school buses smaller than conventional types but with more than  wheels was the truck chassis in widespread use for commercial delivery work the step van within the school bus body industry this type were often called p chassis in addition to wayne blue bird carpenter superior thomas and ward each developed school bus bodies based upon p chassis produced by either general motors ford or both waynes body product for the step van chassis was called the papoose the frontend of the design of the papoose was designed to afford maximum visibility and use flat glass resulting in an appearance which was not aesthetically pleasing it was described by some observers as severe and the funnylooking little bus had other nicknames even less kind in addition to its unusual appearance the wayne papoose faced another disadvantage in the wayne product line the market was highly competitive with all five other major school bus body builders participating waynes marketers wanted something more radical to differentiate a small capacity wayne product busetteedit main article wayne busette in the early s wayne designed a school bus even smaller than the papoose the busette was unique because it was one of the first school buses to be built on a cutaway van chassis previously small school buses were adaptations of fullsize vans or large suvs such as the chevrolet suburban or international travelall the busette featured dual rear wheels on the rear axle which provided extra stability and capability over conversion vehicles introduced in  the busette and its transette commercial variant would set a precedent for how all small buses are designednot just school buses the busette and transette also were among the first small buses to be fitted with wheelchair lifts lifeguardedit main article wayne lifeguard in the early s wayne was one of the first school bus manufacturers to introduce guard rails and allmetal construction into school bus design while safer than wooden body construction riveted metal body panels posed problems of their own in a crash a weak point of the body was identified as the joints where body panels were fastened together in  safety engineers at ward body works of conway arkansas a competing bus manufacturer subjected one of their school bus bodies to a multiple roll test and noted the separation at the joints ward noted that many of their competitors were using far fewer rivets and fasteners this resulted in new attention by all manufacturers to the number and quality of fasteners as opposed to simply adding more fasteners wayne engineers proposed eliminating the body panel joints entirely essentially the entire side of the bus would have to be formed from a single piece of metal the roof panel would be manufactured in the same fashion one piece cut to length fasteners would only be needed for the interior structure the guardrails and at the rear of the bus in  wayne introduced the new design branded the lifeguard although wayne needed specialized equipment to manufacture the lifeguards body panels the design also reduced overall body weight and manhours required for assembly indian head and thyssenedit in  indian head established a joint business venture with thyssenbornemisza group nv a dutch holding company in  the rest of indian head industries was sold to and folded into thyssenbornemisza a conglomerate based in monaco which was owned by one man baron hans heinrich heini thyssenbornemisza the thyssenbornemisza years –edit thyssen spent much of the next – years selling off or closing its north american investments in the late s and early s the portions of thyssenbornemisza which formed the wayne corporation went through a period of decline wayne professional cars ripedit the professional car industry was negatively and profoundly impacted by three factors in the late s at the time many units served as both ambulances and funeral vehicles called combinations combinations disappeared from general service in the late s the downsizing of americas biggest luxury cars beginning with the  model year forced major changes upon professional car builders who were dependent upon car frames purchased from general motors and ford motor company to begin their conversion processes  cadillacmillermeteor hearse customized regulatory changes at the same time changes in the federal ambulance regulations governing minimum width headroom and equipment levels generally required larger vehicles these were part of the  national ems systems act which was passed by congress in  and implemented four years later in  required that communities receiving federal funds for their programs had ambulances that met new federal specifications three design styles meet the criteria and are still in use today type i uses a ton truck chassis with a modular compartment type ii has a heavy duty van body with a raised roof type iii has a cutaway van chassis with a modular compartment passengerbased vehicles were purposely excluded from legislation and the last americanmade automobilebased ambulance was built in  change in ems providers in the early s wayne introduced a full line of noncarbased ambulances the type iii medicruiser was based on the popular dodge bseries van tradesman panel van the careovan was a type ii ambulance and the type i guardian an early version of a ton truckbased modular ambulance by the late s government standards and practical necessities were combining to make professional carbased ambulances unsuitable for virtually all ems transport work downsizing for  the cadillac commercial chassis was downsized to reduce vehicle weight and fuel consumption that year the cadillac division built  of these special lengthened units of that total only  lifeliner cadillac ambulances were manufactured by waynes millermeteor subsidiary for  cadillacs commercial chassis production further declined to only  units millermeteor received orders for only  ambulances there were no  millermeteor ambulances on december   the company with roots tracing back to  closed its doors the company laidoff  employees and terminated the contracts of their  north american distributors by the late s as the situation became critical wayne corporation the parent of mm and cb and waynes thyssen owners chose not to invest heavily in either firm as would have been required in the uncertain futures of the diverging professional car and ambulance building industries there were no buyers for either subsidiary as a going business in  cotnerbevington ambulance product line was sold to gene knisley owner of midcontinent conversion co which was an ambulance and medicar builder in kansas city missouri the cb plant in blytheville arkansas was closed a few years later the rights to the millermeteor name were acquired and resurrected by another professional car builder in norwalk ohio which in  was producing a line of funeral coaches and limousines on cadillac and lincoln chassis under the millermeteor brand name rabbitransit mpg taxiedit about the time of the  energy crisis waynes engineering department experimented with creation of a stretch conversion of the dieselpowered volkswagen rabbit the rabbitransit vehicle would have the potential to transport a large number of passengers – with very efficient fuel consumption in comparison with other automobiles the minitaxi project was dropped by wayne for potential liability reasons the frequently seen rabbitransit at the richmond plant could not be sold for highway use and it was later destroyed the end of the big sixedit in  when the ownership of wayne corporation shifted from indian head to thyssen wayne was one of six major school bus body builders in the united states wayne apparently enjoyed some profitable years in the late s buoyed by sales of its busette and transette product lines by  the company was one of the big six school bus body manufacturing companies in the united states competing with blue bird body company carpenter body works superior coach company thomas built buses inc and ward body works the big six were joined by crown coach corporation and gillig bros manufacturers which traded primarily on the west coast a downturn in north american school bus purchase volumes began in the late s as the children of the baby boom completed their elementary and secondary educations bidding competition for reduced volumes became devastating to profits and even liquidity although not publicly reported as corporate ownership under thyssen was private it is likely that wayne and welles began incurring losses around  or  and these continued into  by  wayne dealers and union leaders were told that the annual losses at waynewelles were reportedly in the millions and the thyssen owners were poised to end the relationship and financial hemorrhage in  following significant concessions by its unionized workers members of united auto workers local   which were intended to make the company more efficient wayne corporation and its canadian subsidiary welles ltd were sold by thyssen to new owners wayne corporation richmond transportation corporation –edit a new logo was adopted for wayne in the s in  richmond transportation corporation rtc was formed by jack h dekruif a corona del mar californiabased industrialist and several officers who had served at wayne for many years under the indian head and thyssen ownership rtc acquired wayne corporation and its welles subsidiary in canada in february  terry g whitesell was named president of rtc a civic leader in richmond indiana his prior responsibilities at wayne included sales marketing and purchasing over a period of more than  years whitesell was wellknown within the company its dealer and supplier networks and the industry although as industrialist investor dekruif had a track record of liquidating troubled businesses he was persuaded to allow the new organization to operate and compete several successful years followed the chaperone and chaperone ii products on cutaway van chassis did well and several wayne dealercontractors were expanding most notably laidlaw in the fall of  the company was preparing to launch an initial public stock offering ipo when black monday struck the stock market that october forcing cancellation of the ipo lifestaredit main article wayne lifestar by the late s the companys best hopes lay in its newest product a transitstyle type d school bus named the lifestar the first production versions were introduced in  featuring the same sidepanel construction as the lifeguard lifestar was to be targeted for the school bus market unlike its largest competitors wayne did not have the manufacturing equipment or capacity to build chassis inhouse consequently chassis from an outside supplier was crucial supply problems outside of the companys control led to the use of several suppliers for the lifestar over its production run richmond transportation corporation rtc declared bankruptcy in august  assets were sold by a federal bankruptcy judge at auction that fall epilogueedit main article wayne wheeled vehicles after the bankruptcy of richmond transportation corporation wayne corporation effectively ceased to exist during its liquidation the product rights and many of the assets of the company aside from the company itself and its liabilities were purchased by a subsidiary of harsco corporation reorganized as wayne wheeled vehicles wwv production of the chaperone lifeguard and lifestar were transferred to a facility in marysville ohio to supplement production of military trucks in june  after an attempted sale of the company fell through wwv was closed down by its parent company at the time of its closure wayne was in the process of launching the rd a rearengine school bus featuring innovations that would have been new to the school bus industry the rd was never massproduced some features were eventually adopted by competitive builders while initially shuttered after the closure the large richmond factory would play a key role in the future of a major competitor to wayne late in the s additionally part of the lifeguard and the busette designs were adopted by competitors as well mid busedit see also mid bus in  following the collapse of the professional car industry and growing overcapacity among school bus body manufacturers superior coach company of lima ohio was shut down by its parent company shellerglobe the next year mid bus was formed by three former superior employees along with seven coworkers they began manufacturing small school buses in a different facility in lima while fullsize buses still retained the superior name the company debuted a small bus named superior by mid bus a conversion of a fullsize van it also added a raised roof reinforced body sides and school bus windows in  the superior by mid bus name was dropped in favor of mid bus by the end of the s mid bus sought to compete with largerscale school bus manufactures the company sought expertise in developing a product based on a cutaway van in  wayne corporation discontinued busette production in favor of its newer chaperone model additionally the company was closing the welles plant in canada where busette production had been located mid bus entered into an arrangement with wayne to take over busette production in its own facility in ohiocitation needed not only did the use of an existing design lower development costs but the popularity of the busette especially among head start agencies allowed for an existing customer base crown by carpenteredit see also crown by carpenter in may  carpenter body works of mitchell indiana purchased the tooling intellectual and product rights of crown coach corporation a californiabased school bus manufacturer that had closed that year while carpenter had originally planned to restart production of the crown supercoach series ii its high cost and complexity of production would cause that proposal to be shelved in favor of its own design in  carpenter began a series of major changes within the company in order to regain lost market share to modernize its production facilities carpenter moved out of its aging facilities in mitchell indiana and leased the shuttered wayne facilities in richmond moving its corporate headquarters there by moving to the wayne facilities carpenter had the asset of combining its own team with former wayne corporation employees both the leadership and workforce based at richmond included a number of veterans of the former wayne operations there as such they brought considerable experience and knowledge of the plant and industry to the effort nevertheless major outside forces still to be faced were a supply of suitable chassis and the overcapacity of the body industry as part of the move carpenter unveiled major changes for its  product line on the outside the body now wore fulllength guard rails above the wheels under the skin the body was redesigned with singlepiece roof bows new welding procedures allowed by the equipment at richmond strengthened roof joints unlike a crucial structural flaw later found in mitchellproduced buses inside the bus wayne tooling was used to update certain areas of the carpenter buses on conventional buses carpenter reused the driver control panel and windshield from the wayne lifeguard all fullsize buses would use wayne entry doors the company considered the transformation so extensive that it changed its name and company logo resurrecting the first half of the crown coach name carpenter was now known as crown by carpenter and used its own version of a logo introduced by crown coach in the late s in an effort to further diversify its product line outside of school buses the company introduced a delivery truck loosely based on its cadet bus products in  carpenter was acquired by one of its largest chassis suppliers spartan motors of charlotte michigan spartan motors was a chassis supplier known for highmargin lowvolume markets some examples include chassis for fire apparatus and luxury motorhomes spartan was a supplier for certain models of the blue bird wanderlodge for example during the economic times around the millennium lower initial capital costs for school buses seemed to trump their longevity when it was time for purchasing decisions financially pressed districts and contractors tended to select cheaper products with short life cycles this was much the same dilemma faced by wayne wheeled vehicles parent company harscobmy where a lesser quantity of higher quality products at a correspondingly higher price had also been the plants historical output carpenter had been struggling for almost  years when it too finally ended school bus production in  spartan by then a ⅔ owner did not see a solution to the market dilemma and felt the projected continued losses would exceed the value to their business plan voting to end the venture future of the plantedit this article needs to be updated please update

overviewedit wayne is a name in school transportation that predates the familiar yellow school bus seen all over the united states and canada beginning in the th century craftsmen in richmond indiana at wayne works and its successors built horsedrawn vehicles including kid hacks evolving into automobiles and virtually all types of bus bodies during the th century wayne products eventually included school buses transit buses highway coaches military and shuttle buses ambulances and even huge bus bodies pulled by tractor trailers used to haul oil field workers in the middle east among many innovations wayne pioneered the guard rails on the sides of all school buses today inboard wheelchair lifts and even highheadroom doors a special accommodation for mobilitychallenged persons requiring head and neck support from above the company was the first with a school bus based upon a cutaway van chassis the wayne busette a chassis design which more than  years later remains one of the most popular in use in north american markets the crowning safety achievement was the wayne lifeguard structural design introduced in  which featured continuous interior and exterior longitudinal panels the lifeguards design helped pave the way for the allimportant us federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss for school buses most of which became applicable on april   in the years after wayne continued to be a leader in bus safety engineering wayne went through many owners during the second half of the th century the business underwent periods under the ownership of divco as divcowayne boise cascade indian head inc and the thyssenbornemisza group it moved to a greatly expanded facility adjacent to interstate  in  where it became a familiar landmark to millions of travelers after encountering a difficult market cycle and industry downturn due to overcapacity beginning in the early s wayne corporation finally closed in  several efforts to continue to utilize portions of the assets and build school buses ended in  as of  thousands of wayne buses remained in service although the numbers are dwindling each year as new buses replace them in school and commercial operations some have been converted to motor homes and other uses the former wayne corporation property along interstate  is becoming reutilized for a number of retail and industrial enterprises early historyedit after starting out as wayne agricultural works in dublin indiana in the mid th century all manufacturing was centralized at richmond indiana most bus bodies consisted of inhouse manufactured parts and purchased components manufactured by others combined into bus bodies in assembly operations thus the major two functions of the richmond indiana plant were manufacturing of parts and assembly wayne bus bodies were also assembled at multiple locations of truck body dealers around the us and at a canadian assembly plant welles ltd in windsor ontario kits were also shipped overseas even after all north american assembly was eventually centralized in richmond indiana and windsor ontario in the early s kid hacksedit a  ford model t kid hackbus body manufacturer unknown by combining the kid hack wagon body with an automotive chassis wayne works helped create the school bus in its earliest form waynes predecessor wayne works was founded in the united states of america in  wayne works began by making horsedrawn vehicles by  and possibly earlier it is known that wayne works was making horsedrawn school carriages which many people referred to as school hacks school cars school trucks or kid hacks as education in the united states shifted from small one room schools to fewer but larger multiroom schools fewer children lived within walking distances initially as many students who needed transportation lived in rural areas the need was filled by adapted farm vehicles soon these practices and operations evolved and expanded into todays school transportation systems beginning in the early s through the s several automobile designers and manufacturers were located in richmond among the automobiles manufactured there was the richmond which was built by the wayne works the rodefeld and the crosley the wayne county historical museum in richmond indiana has a rare  richmond on display along with horsedrawn kid hack also manufactured by the wayne works first busesedit according to several sources in  wayne works mounted a wooden kid hack onto an automobile chassis creating a predecessor to the modern motor school bus in the vehicle bodies for school transportation that the company produced during this era passengers sat on perimeter seating facing the sides rather than the front of the bus entry and egress was through a door at the rear a design begun in nonmotorized days to help avoiding startling the horses this feature was retained becoming the rear emergency exit seen on todays buses the primary mode of ingressegress was now through a curbside door safety innovationsedit by  wayne works was building allsteel bus bodies in the following few years the school bus bodies began to include a group of heavyduty collision rails or guard rails as an added safety feature wayne works was one of the earliest school bus companies to offer glass in place of the standard canvas curtains in the passenger area glass did not become a common feature until the s although not the first to introduce the type in the s wayne works was among the first manufacturers to produce transitstyle school buses a body with a more or less flat frontend design initial production of waynes forward control bus bodies were conversions of conventional bus chassis however the conventional design with a cowled chassis known as type c on modern school buses would be the bulk of waynes sales until production ended in  world war ii – wooden bodies and trailer busesedit to conserve steel for war use wayne works and other manufacturers reverted from allsteel construction to building some bus bodies with wooden components during world war ii the company also developed trailertype bodies for military use which could transport up to  passengers pulled by a truck thousands of military ambulance bodies were also produced the company also did some reconstruction on older buses and trucks to extend their lives during the war years as did other bus body manufacturers in  as the end of world war ii approached wayne returned to building allsteel bodies welles canadian bus assemblyedit welles corporation in windsor ontario was named for halsey v welles who founded h v welles ltd in  originally named warford corp of canada it was first established to distribute warford transmissions expanding into aftermarket products primarily for ford trucks in  welles corp became the sole canadian distributor of wayne works school buses in  under new yorkbased financier newton glekel divcowayne acquired welles corp ltd and incorporated it as a new subsidiary division of divcowayne diversificationedit wayne works began to diversify into other fields besides bus production through several acquisitions in the mids these acquisitions primarily brought wayne into the world of professional car production the company purchased meteor motor car company in piqua ohio in  meteor built professional cars such as limousines and ambulances two years later in  wayne acquired aj millers professional car building company of bellefontaine ohio the aj miller company had begun in  by making horse carriages and then started making automobiles in the early part of the th century however the small company found it could not compete with the larger automobile makers so they began specializing in hearses and ambulances over the years the miller hearses became known and used throughout the world the miller co was combined with waynes existing professional car subsidiary meteor motor car company forming the new millermeteor mm division of wayne the  companies competed in  but were doing business as a combination by  divcowayne corporation –edit in  under the leadership of newton glekel divco corporation bought the wayne works a school bus builder in richmond indiana and renamed itself divcowayne corporation divcowayne also known as dw was a conglomerate involved in the manufacturing of trucks school buses hearses ambulances and mobile homes and apparently also had had an electronics section involved in aerospace technology divcoedit main article divco divco delivery truck divco stands for detroit industrial vehicles company founded in  divco was known for its pioneering delivery vehicles especially milk trucks from  to  divco produced multistop delivery trucks only the vw beetle stayed in production with the same basic model for a longer period of time divco trucks have become popular collectible vehicles today during the divcowayne era the truck manufacturing of divcowayne continued to be through the former divco portion some divco trucks were modified with seats and windows from the wayne works to produce a divco dividend bus very few of these units were built between  and  virtually all bus and ambulance manufacturing was through the wayne corporation portion of divcowayne and subsidiary units millermeteor and cotnerbevington exportedit wayne export was another division which specialized in selling disassembled wayne bodies knockdown kits ckds outside north america by  wayne bus bodies were in use in  different countries in  wayne licensed the spanish sa bosuga to build in barcelona coach bodies based on waynes technology and designs these were marketed as bosuga wayne utilizing mainly pegaso and barreirosaec chassis the venture was shortlived since the spanish market for coach bodies was crowded other productsedit during the late s and early s the divcowayne conglomerate would diversify its product lines entering vehicle segments far removed from divco delivery vehicles and wayne school buses in addition the conglomerate expanded into various nonautomotive products professional carsedit the professional car quoted from a leading trade association is loosely defined as a custombodied vehicle based on passenger car styling and used in the funeral rescue or livery services such vehicles may be hearses flower cars service cars ambulances limousines or cars specially built to combine two or more of these different functions such as combination hearseambulances sedan ambulances or invalid coaches using vehicles such as the cadillac commercial chassis as a donor vehicle the bodywork including the roof glass and doors was completed by coachbuilders from the dashboard rearward nearly all exterior and interior bodywork was manufactured by hand by  professional and combination cars became obsolete as general motors and ford downsized their fullsize automobiles while funeral cars remained based on automobiles ambulances were shifted to vanbased chassis millermeteoredit wayne professional cars a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance professional car manufacturers miller and meteor newly combined as millermeteor were brought into the fold of divcowayne as the newly formed conglomerate was developing its opportunities in this field although the recently combined millermeteor company was initially based at bellefontaine ohio originally the home of the aj miller company under divcowayne ownership it was later relocated to piqua ohio meteors old hometown nearby ecto the vehicle used by the main characters in the  film ghostbusters and its  sequel is a conversion of a  cadillac millermeteor ambulance cotnerbevingtonedit divcowayne acquired cotnerbevington cb in  and it became a subsidiary of wayne corporation comet coach company was based in memphis tennessee in  the coachbuilder sold its comet trade name rights to the lincolnmercury division of ford motor company for use on the mercury version of the ford falcon in  the mercury comet was introduced starting with the  model year the former comet coach co was renamed cotnerbevington named after the two founders of the company they moved from memphis tennessee a few miles north to blytheville arkansas cb stayed in business through the  model year building only on oldsmobile automobile chassis and truckbased ambulances after about  waynes line of truckbased ambulances sentinel suburbans starting for the  model year vanguard chevrolet vans for  and medicruiser dodge vans for  were built in the blytheville facility the sentinel suburbans received a headroom increase for  but were only built through the  model year after that the sentinel brand name was used on waynes line of type i pickup chassis modular ambulances body shells were produced at the richmond indiana bus plant for careovan ambulance units based upon cutaway chassis and wayne busette body nonautomotive divisionsedit divcowayne corporation manufactured housing brands included kozy elcar star and national electronics and aerospace products were offered through dw electronics in cincinnati ohio the divcowayne conglomerate also had a financial arm divcowayne acceptance corporation which was also known as divcowayne financial wayne acceptance or financial corporation and wayne financial sales corporation new richmond factoryedit during the earlier years of the school bus industry the factory manufactured most of the parts used to assemble a bus body but it was customary for these to be shipped unassembled to body dealers around the united states and canada for assembly onto an incomplete truck chassis gradually as highway transportation of completed buses became more practical and school bus bodies became more sophisticated the assembly of complete bodies onto truck chassis in the united states and canada became centralized at locations owned by the body companies the companies often continued to ship kits overseas by the mids several other body companies notably blue bird body company and perley a thomas car works maintained assembly plants at multiple locations in the united states instead of establishing multiple assembly points in the us wayne chose to replace the overcrowded and aged wayne works facility on e street near downtown richmond with a single new plant large enough to handle both manufacturing and united states assembly due primarily to canadian import tariffs the separate canadian assembly plant welles ltd had been established and was maintained for canadian production as early as  divcowayne started plans for the construction of a new plant initially a site was selected in florence kentucky where the company purchased an option to acquire  acres  km in an industrial park the community in richmond indiana responded to the possible loss of the plant and jobs with provision of a acre  km parcel conveniently located near the intersection of interstate  and us  northwest of the city in  wayne corporation relocated from the former wayne works plant to the new site on industries road about  miles  km northwest of downtown richmond the new  million facility had  square feet  m under a single roof it featured fully modern steel manufacturing presses rustproofing equipment paint booths and could handle assembly lines for all product lines distribution networkedit more than a few wayne dealerships were operated by school bus contractors ara transportation and laidlaw were the largest others included bus and bodies of plaistow new hampshire town  country transportation of warren rhode island rohrer of duncannon pennsylvania virginia overland transportation of richmond virginia and school bus services of shawnee mission kansas these school bus contractors several of whom were also involved in contracting paratransit services found having a dealership provided both a source and an input to product design at wayne as well as a natural outlet for sale of surplus equipment at the end of contract periods breakupedit in  the divcowayne conglomerate was sold by newton glekel to boise cascade a company which was primarily seeking the housing manufacturing subsidiaries boise cascade resold wayne and its subsidiaries to indian head inc another conglomerate about the same time that divcowayne was sold to indian head the divco portion was separated and divested production of divco products continued until  wayne corporation an indian head company –edit  wayneinternational school bus retired divcowayne had formed a union and had expanded into a moderate sizedconglomerate with all facilities basically within  miles  km of waynes richmond indiana base in contrast indian head was already a large and diversified corporate conglomerate when it purchased wayne corporation and its subsidiaries in  indian head inc acquired wayne corp which its history recorded as maker of school buses ambulances hearses professional cars from divcowayne newgeneration school busesedit the late s and early s led to the development of new platforms suitable for use for small school buses additionally to improve the basic structural integrity of fullsize school buses wayne engineers went back to the drawing board and changed how school buses were constructed with an allnew body design papooseedit in the early s the principal platform for school buses smaller than conventional types but with more than  wheels was the truck chassis in widespread use for commercial delivery work the step van within the school bus body industry this type were often called p chassis in addition to wayne blue bird carpenter superior thomas and ward each developed school bus bodies based upon p chassis produced by either general motors ford or both waynes body product for the step van chassis was called the papoose the frontend of the design of the papoose was designed to afford maximum visibility and use flat glass resulting in an appearance which was not aesthetically pleasing it was described by some observers as severe and the funnylooking little bus had other nicknames even less kind in addition to its unusual appearance the wayne papoose faced another disadvantage in the wayne product line the market was highly competitive with all five other major school bus body builders participating waynes marketers wanted something more radical to differentiate a small capacity wayne product busetteedit main article wayne busette in the early s wayne designed a school bus even smaller than the papoose the busette was unique because it was one of the first school buses to be built on a cutaway van chassis previously small school buses were adaptations of fullsize vans or large suvs such as the chevrolet suburban or international travelall the busette featured dual rear wheels on the rear axle which provided extra stability and capability over conversion vehicles introduced in  the busette and its transette commercial variant would set a precedent for how all small buses are designednot just school buses the busette and transette also were among the first small buses to be fitted with wheelchair lifts lifeguardedit main article wayne lifeguard in the early s wayne was one of the first school bus manufacturers to introduce guard rails and allmetal construction into school bus design while safer than wooden body construction riveted metal body panels posed problems of their own in a crash a weak point of the body was identified as the joints where body panels were fastened together in  safety engineers at ward body works of conway arkansas a competing bus manufacturer subjected one of their school bus bodies to a multiple roll test and noted the separation at the joints ward noted that many of their competitors were using far fewer rivets and fasteners this resulted in new attention by all manufacturers to the number and quality of fasteners as opposed to simply adding more fasteners wayne engineers proposed eliminating the body panel joints entirely essentially the entire side of the bus would have to be formed from a single piece of metal the roof panel would be manufactured in the same fashion one piece cut to length fasteners would only be needed for the interior structure the guardrails and at the rear of the bus in  wayne introduced the new design branded the lifeguard although wayne needed specialized equipment to manufacture the lifeguards body panels the design also reduced overall body weight and manhours required for assembly indian head and thyssenedit in  indian head established a joint business venture with thyssenbornemisza group nv a dutch holding company in  the rest of indian head industries was sold to and folded into thyssenbornemisza a conglomerate based in monaco which was owned by one man baron hans heinrich heini thyssenbornemisza the thyssenbornemisza years –edit thyssen spent much of the next – years selling off or closing its north american investments in the late s and early s the portions of thyssenbornemisza which formed the wayne corporation went through a period of decline wayne professional cars ripedit the professional car industry was negatively and profoundly impacted by three factors in the late s at the time many units served as both ambulances and funeral vehicles called combinations combinations disappeared from general service in the late s the downsizing of americas biggest luxury cars beginning with the  model year forced major changes upon professional car builders who were dependent upon car frames purchased from general motors and ford motor company to begin their conversion processes  cadillacmillermeteor hearse customized regulatory changes at the same time changes in the federal ambulance regulations governing minimum width headroom and equipment levels generally required larger vehicles these were part of the  national ems systems act which was passed by congress in  and implemented four years later in  required that communities receiving federal funds for their programs had ambulances that met new federal specifications three design styles meet the criteria and are still in use today type i uses a ton truck chassis with a modular compartment type ii has a heavy duty van body with a raised roof type iii has a cutaway van chassis with a modular compartment passengerbased vehicles were purposely excluded from legislation and the last americanmade automobilebased ambulance was built in  change in ems providers in the early s wayne introduced a full line of noncarbased ambulances the type iii medicruiser was based on the popular dodge bseries van tradesman panel van the careovan was a type ii ambulance and the type i guardian an early version of a ton truckbased modular ambulance by the late s government standards and practical necessities were combining to make professional carbased ambulances unsuitable for virtually all ems transport work downsizing for  the cadillac commercial chassis was downsized to reduce vehicle weight and fuel consumption that year the cadillac division built  of these special lengthened units of that total only  lifeliner cadillac ambulances were manufactured by waynes millermeteor subsidiary for  cadillacs commercial chassis production further declined to only  units millermeteor received orders for only  ambulances there were no  millermeteor ambulances on december   the company with roots tracing back to  closed its doors the company laidoff  employees and terminated the contracts of their  north american distributors by the late s as the situation became critical wayne corporation the parent of mm and cb and waynes thyssen owners chose not to invest heavily in either firm as would have been required in the uncertain futures of the diverging professional car and ambulance building industries there were no buyers for either subsidiary as a going business in  cotnerbevington ambulance product line was sold to gene knisley owner of midcontinent conversion co which was an ambulance and medicar builder in kansas city missouri the cb plant in blytheville arkansas was closed a few years later the rights to the millermeteor name were acquired and resurrected by another professional car builder in norwalk ohio which in  was producing a line of funeral coaches and limousines on cadillac and lincoln chassis under the millermeteor brand name rabbitransit mpg taxiedit about the time of the  energy crisis waynes engineering department experimented with creation of a stretch conversion of the dieselpowered volkswagen rabbit the rabbitransit vehicle would have the potential to transport a large number of passengers – with very efficient fuel consumption in comparison with other automobiles the minitaxi project was dropped by wayne for potential liability reasons the frequently seen rabbitransit at the richmond plant could not be sold for highway use and it was later destroyed the end of the big sixedit in  when the ownership of wayne corporation shifted from indian head to thyssen wayne was one of six major school bus body builders in the united states wayne apparently enjoyed some profitable years in the late s buoyed by sales of its busette and transette product lines by  the company was one of the big six school bus body manufacturing companies in the united states competing with blue bird body company carpenter body works superior coach company thomas built buses inc and ward body works the big six were joined by crown coach corporation and gillig bros manufacturers which traded primarily on the west coast a downturn in north american school bus purchase volumes began in the late s as the children of the baby boom completed their elementary and secondary educations bidding competition for reduced volumes became devastating to profits and even liquidity although not publicly reported as corporate ownership under thyssen was private it is likely that wayne and welles began incurring losses around  or  and these continued into  by  wayne dealers and union leaders were told that the annual losses at waynewelles were reportedly in the millions and the thyssen owners were poised to end the relationship and financial hemorrhage in  following significant concessions by its unionized workers members of united auto workers local   which were intended to make the company more efficient wayne corporation and its canadian subsidiary welles ltd were sold by thyssen to new owners wayne corporation richmond transportation corporation –edit a new logo was adopted for wayne in the s in  richmond transportation corporation rtc was formed by jack h dekruif a corona del mar californiabased industrialist and several officers who had served at wayne for many years under the indian head and thyssen ownership rtc acquired wayne corporation and its welles subsidiary in canada in february  terry g whitesell was named president of rtc a civic leader in richmond indiana his prior responsibilities at wayne included sales marketing and purchasing over a period of more than  years whitesell was wellknown within the company its dealer and supplier networks and the industry although as industrialist investor dekruif had a track record of liquidating troubled businesses he was persuaded to allow the new organization to operate and compete several successful years followed the chaperone and chaperone ii products on cutaway van chassis did well and several wayne dealercontractors were expanding most notably laidlaw in the fall of  the company was preparing to launch an initial public stock offering ipo when black monday struck the stock market that october forcing cancellation of the ipo lifestaredit main article wayne lifestar by the late s the companys best hopes lay in its newest product a transitstyle type d school bus named the lifestar the first production versions were introduced in  featuring the same sidepanel construction as the lifeguard lifestar was to be targeted for the school bus market unlike its largest competitors wayne did not have the manufacturing equipment or capacity to build chassis inhouse consequently chassis from an outside supplier was crucial supply problems outside of the companys control led to the use of several suppliers for the lifestar over its production run richmond transportation corporation rtc declared bankruptcy in august  assets were sold by a federal bankruptcy judge at auction that fall epilogueedit main article wayne wheeled vehicles after the bankruptcy of richmond transportation corporation wayne corporation effectively ceased to exist during its liquidation the product rights and many of the assets of the company aside from the company itself and its liabilities were purchased by a subsidiary of harsco corporation reorganized as wayne wheeled vehicles wwv production of the chaperone lifeguard and lifestar were transferred to a facility in marysville ohio to supplement production of military trucks in june  after an attempted sale of the company fell through wwv was closed down by its parent company at the time of its closure wayne was in the process of launching the rd a rearengine school bus featuring innovations that would have been new to the school bus industry the rd was never massproduced some features were eventually adopted by competitive builders while initially shuttered after the closure the large richmond factory would play a key role in the future of a major competitor to wayne late in the s additionally part of the lifeguard and the busette designs were adopted by competitors as well mid busedit see also mid bus in  following the collapse of the professional car industry and growing overcapacity among school bus body manufacturers superior coach company of lima ohio was shut down by its parent company shellerglobe the next year mid bus was formed by three former superior employees along with seven coworkers they began manufacturing small school buses in a different facility in lima while fullsize buses still retained the superior name the company debuted a small bus named superior by mid bus a conversion of a fullsize van it also added a raised roof reinforced body sides and school bus windows in  the superior by mid bus name was dropped in favor of mid bus by the end of the s mid bus sought to compete with largerscale school bus manufactures the company sought expertise in developing a product based on a cutaway van in  wayne corporation discontinued busette production in favor of its newer chaperone model additionally the company was closing the welles plant in canada where busette production had been located mid bus entered into an arrangement with wayne to take over busette production in its own facility in ohiocitation needed not only did the use of an existing design lower development costs but the popularity of the busette especially among head start agencies allowed for an existing customer base crown by carpenteredit see also crown by carpenter in may  carpenter body works of mitchell indiana purchased the tooling intellectual and product rights of crown coach corporation a californiabased school bus manufacturer that had closed that year while carpenter had originally planned to restart production of the crown supercoach series ii its high cost and complexity of production would cause that proposal to be shelved in favor of its own design in  carpenter began a series of major changes within the company in order to regain lost market share to modernize its production facilities carpenter moved out of its aging facilities in mitchell indiana and leased the shuttered wayne facilities in richmond moving its corporate headquarters there by moving to the wayne facilities carpenter had the asset of combining its own team with former wayne corporation employees both the leadership and workforce based at richmond included a number of veterans of the former wayne operations there as such they brought considerable experience and knowledge of the plant and industry to the effort nevertheless major outside forces still to be faced were a supply of suitable chassis and the overcapacity of the body industry as part of the move carpenter unveiled major changes for its  product line on the outside the body now wore fulllength guard rails above the wheels under the skin the body was redesigned with singlepiece roof bows new welding procedures allowed by the equipment at richmond strengthened roof joints unlike a crucial structural flaw later found in mitchellproduced buses inside the bus wayne tooling was used to update certain areas of the carpenter buses on conventional buses carpenter reused the driver control panel and windshield from the wayne lifeguard all fullsize buses would use wayne entry doors the company considered the transformation so extensive that it changed its name and company logo resurrecting the first half of the crown coach name carpenter was now known as crown by carpenter and used its own version of a logo introduced by crown coach in the late s in an effort to further diversify its product line outside of school buses the company introduced a delivery truck loosely based on its cadet bus products in  carpenter was acquired by one of its largest chassis suppliers spartan motors of charlotte michigan spartan motors was a chassis supplier known for highmargin lowvolume markets some examples include chassis for fire apparatus and luxury motorhomes spartan was a supplier for certain models of the blue bird wanderlodge for example during the economic times around the millennium lower initial capital costs for school buses seemed to trump their longevity when it was time for purchasing decisions financially pressed districts and contractors tended to select cheaper products with short life cycles this was much the same dilemma faced by wayne wheeled vehicles parent company harscobmy where a lesser quantity of higher quality products at a correspondingly higher price had also been the plants historical output carpenter had been struggling for almost  years when it too finally ended school bus production in  spartan by then a ⅔ owner did not see a solution to the market dilemma and felt the projected continued losses would exceed the value to their business plan voting to end the venture future of the plantedit this article needs to be updated please update
