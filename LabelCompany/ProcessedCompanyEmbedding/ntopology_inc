product topology  wikipedia product topology from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search product space redirects here for other uses see the product space in topology and related areas of mathematics a product space is the cartesian product of a family of topological spaces equipped with a natural topology called the product topology this topology differs from another perhaps more obvious topology called the box topology which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces however the product topology is correct in that it makes the product space a categorical product of its factors whereas the box topology is too fine this is the sense in which the product topology is natural contents  definition  examples  properties  relation to other topological notions  axiom of choice  see also  notes  references  external links definitionedit given x such that x  ∏ i ∈ i x i  the product topology is also called the topology of pointwise convergence because of the following fact a sequence or net in x converges if and only if all its projections to the spaces xi converge in particular if one considers the space x  ri of all real valued functions on i convergence in the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions any product of closed subsets of xi is a closed set in x an important theorem about the product topology is tychonoffs theorem any product of compact spaces is compact this is easy to show for finite products while the general statement is equivalent to the axiom of choice relation to other topological notionsedit separation every product of t spaces is t every product of t spaces is t every product of hausdorff spaces is hausdorff every product of regular spaces is regular every product of tychonoff spaces is tychonoff a product of normal spaces need not be normal compactness every product of compact spaces is compact tychonoffs theorem a product of locally compact spaces need not be locally compact however an arbitrary product of locally compact spaces where all but finitely many are compact is locally compact this condition is sufficient and necessary connectedness every product of connected resp pathconnected spaces is connected resp pathconnected every product of hereditarily disconnected spaces is hereditarily disconnected metric spaces countable products of metric spaces are metrizable axiom of choiceedit the axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that the product of a collection of nonempty sets is nonempty the proof is easy enough one needs only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product conversely a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one element from each component the axiom of choice occurs again in the study of topological product spaces for example tychonoffs theorem on compact sets is a more complex and subtle example of a statement that is equivalent to the axiom of choice see alsoedit disjoint union topology projective limit topology quotient space subspace topology notesedit  product topology preserves

process  additive manufacturing am exclusive with ntopology inc — making lattice design an integrated and seamless part of the design process posted on june   by david   ntopology inc based in new york new york usa recently released a topology optimization software program called element free that provides engineers and designers with the ability to create complex structures using lattice design tools currently element free is a free windows download application the company has further plans to release a second software program element pro this summer ntopology inc at amd charlotte north carolina usa  august  we caught up with spencer wright head of product for ntopology inc to learn about topology optimization and ntopology inc in an exclusive amazing® qa conversation  amazing® spencer thank you for your participation how would you define topology optimization spencer wright topology optimization looks at a part and tries to move material around and hopefully remove it too so that it’s as efficient as possible traditional topology optimization usually takes a design space literally a d volume and some loading conditions as inputs and tries to either minimize mass or maximize stiffness on the output but that’s just one approach to topology optimization there are other ways to think of the design space and other outputs that you can optimize for and many strategies that you can take to get from one to the other photo courtesy of ntopology inc in general i find conventional topology optimization to be a bit short sighted and prefer to guide the design process through a specific design approach usually including variable lattice structures i also find the massstiffness criteria extremely limiting as a product manager and prefer optimization software that takes printability and manufacturing process chain into account as well amazing® as stated on the company website ntopology inc was founded with the goal to help engineers make better d printed parts what was the motivation for creating design software specifically for additive manufacturing spencer wright additive offers the chance to rethink the design process and it has brought a new influx of talent and interest to engineering and manufacturing as a product manager myself i know that other manufacturing processes moulding milling grinding edm etc are key in bringing products to market but as a cad company there’s a real opportunity to using design for am as a testing ground for changes that we think the overall engineering industry might benefit from amazing® ntopology recently released a free windows download application called “element free” that will provide engineers and designers with the ability to create complex interlaced lattice structures tell us about element free what makes element free easier more intuitive and more accessible to a growing market of designers and engineers interested in topology optimization spencer wright until additive manufacturing there was never a need for cad software to support d lattice design element free brings together the core elements of the lattice design work that ntopology has been doing for years and gives you a powerful set of tools to create highly variable structures quickly lattice design is all that it does and it does that really well in that respect it’s like any singlepurpose tool and you can think of traditional d cad software like a swiss army knife everyone knows that the corkscrew in your kitchen is way better at opening a bottle of wine than a swiss army knife is and element free is way better at designing lattices than traditional cad software it’s just that nobody ever thought to devote energy to lattice design before because additive manufacturing only just made it possible to manufacture lattices in the first place image courtesy of ntopology inc amazing® ntopology has plans to release a professional version called “element pro” this summer what can you tell us about element pro how is element pro ideally suited for additive manufacturing spencer wright let me start with this i honestly believe that element free is the most powerful lattice design software on the market – paid or free but if you want to do mechanical analysis or optimize the orientation of your lattice for performance andor printability or really exploit the variable mechanical properties that lattices offer then you’ll need a little more we learned this in  when we developed element beta and built a whole suite of bespoke tools to do things like simulation morphing warping subdivision and custom lattice rule building image courtesy of ntopology inc we’re now in the process of porting those and a few new features over as pro modules that will live on top of element free the first of these out in late june is a data exchange format that allows you to import and export lattices from element to your favorite fea and build processing software and we’ll have a few additional modules coming out later in the summer amazing® recently airbus and autodesk showcased an a bionic partition separates the passenger cabin from the galley that replicated cellular structure and bone growth found in living organisms do you envision the use of lattice structure optimized for additive manufacturing will become commonplace in the next generation of additive manufacturing parts spencer wright first let me say that i think that the living autodesk did a really great job on that project their approach treated the structure at multiple levels macrostructure printed component lattice which is really necessary on any serious project as far as the future of lattices goes there are a lot of applications where they will no doubt be useful – and many especially in the medical implants field that are already in production there are certainly obstacles for many of these – surface finish is a big factor as is the need for a new paradigm for documentation and inspection of highly complex parts but the benefits are there – both in terms of improved performance and the reduced dimensionality of the design process lattices make it extremely easy to design variable structures and with ntopology element we make lattice design an integrated and seamless part of your existing design process image courtesy of ntopology inc amazing® as we understand you will be a presenter at this year’s asme additive manufacturing  d printing conference amd what topics do you plan on presenting at amd spencer wright i’ll be talking unsurprisingly  about lattice design in particular i’m very interested in how lattices – with all their complexity – actually help reduce the complexity of the design process looking forward to it this concludes our interview spencer thank you very much for your participation we are very grateful for the opportunity to learn about ntopology products and services and upcoming presentation at amd  about spencer wright spencer wright is vp of product at

background conventional cad tools solidworks siemens nx onshape etc in total a b industry growing at about  are designed for conventional manufacturing casting machining forging stamping etc the limitations of those processes are built into the design software itself additive manufacturing also known as d printing allows for material to be arranged in ways that were never possible before it is possible to use conventional cad to design parts that will be d printed but in general the process will be long difficult and produce suboptimal results as additive manufacturing matures the industry is about b now and growing at about  cagr there is a pressing need for cad tools that are designed specifically for it our solution ntopology’s first product element is a d design suite made specifically for additive manufacturing element provides the feedback engineers need to account for the design limitations and opportunities of additive manufacturing with element parts that before would take weeks to design can be imagined and sent to manufacturing in a matter of hours strategy in  we ran a beta program to test features on a range of tools for d lattice design in april of  we released a stripped down free version of our lattice design software in the coming months we’ll release a series of paid modules that will sell on an annual subscription basis team with handson
