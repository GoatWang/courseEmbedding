valuesummaryhercules offshore faces strong opposition from big shareholder centerbridge partners to its plan to shut down and sell off its assetscenterbridge is urging that the confirmation hearing be pushed offhero is an interesting case but i recommend to stay away from any investing or trading right now unless you like to gamble this article is an update of my earlier article on hercules offshorenasdaqhero from may   on june   the wall street journal published an article written by m peg wrikley liquidating oildrilling fleet operator hercules offshore inc faces strong opposition from big shareholder centerbridge partners lp to its plan to shut down and sell off its assets hercules returned to bankruptcy sunday less than six months after a balancesheet reshaping that was supposed to get it in shape for tough times in the oil industry centerbridge contends the balancesheet reshaping worked but claims senior lenders maneuvered the company back into chapter  for improper purposes hercules lawyer philip dublin said the argument is not correct but will play out in the coming months in a delaware bankruptcy court just a quick reminder of the proposed bankruptcy on friday may   the company announced the following the company has entered into a restructuring support agreement rsa with lenders holding approximately  percent of the indebtedness under its first lien credit agreement the agreement seeks to maximize value for the companys stakeholders and provide a smooth transition for employees customers and suppliers through an orderly sale of the companys assets under the terms of the rsa hercules and certain of its us subsidiaries will solicit acceptances and rejections of its prepackaged chapter  plan from first lien lenders and shareholders file voluntary chapter  petitions to compromise the companys obligations to its first lien lenders and provide a recovery to its shareholders and then place all of the companys unsold assets into a winddown vehicle to ensure their continued safe operation until they can be sold the companys international subsidiaries will not be included as part of the chapter  cases but will be part of the sale process what is the amount really owed to the lenders it is now important to read the k filing and stay away from any interpretation from the press release which is quite misleading in my opinion the k filing is saying the following pursuant to the ar forbearance agreement the borrower received written notice from the agent that the commitments under the first lien credit agreement are terminated and the outstanding loans under the first lien credit agreement are declared due and payable in whole including without limitation the principal of the loans under the first lien credit agreement together with accrued interest thereon unpaid accrued fees the applicable premium as defined in the first lien credit agreement and all other obligations of the borrower accrued under the first lien credit agreement and any other loan document as defined under the first lien credit agreement what does it mean assuming that the plan will be approved and prior to the distribution hercules offshore owes at least  million plus unpaid and accrued interest to the first lien lenders from the  million here is an excerpt of the credit agreement in the k page  term sheet as of the rsa effective date the aggregate amount of first lien claims is  million plus accrued and unpaid interest prior to taking into account any prepayments thereon contemplated by the amended and restated forbearance agreement however if the plan is approved if the class of holders of hero common stock votes to accept the plan the first lien lenders shall receive their pro rata share of nysei a noninterest bearing senior claim against the wind down entity in the amount of usd  million less the escrow release payment as defined in the term sheet and any amounts previously distributed to the first lien lenders during the chapter  cases and ii  of class a interests in the wind down entity which shall represent  of the acceptance wind down entity interests as defined in the term sheet the distribution will be  to the shareholders the wsj article said tuesday as hercules pushed crucial early motions through court centerbridge lawyer andrew glenn accused senior lenders of manufacturing an unnecessary bankruptcy to collect a premium for early payoff of their debt why are we here today given that the company has well over  million in cash… and oil has rebounded mr glenn asked centerbridge partners lp is a private investment firm with offices in new york and london the firm focuses on private equity  credit investments centerbridge partners owns  shares of hero as of  per hercules offshore website the lawyer for centerbridge partners m andrew glenn accused the senior lenders to have created a situation to collect an applicable premium  roughly  million  which i think is an issue that can be potentially debated if the right argument is used and if the issue of the initial default is questioned however what i do not understand is that m andrew glenn indicated that this situation is unnecessary due in part because the oil has rebounded which is certainly the wrong argument in my opinion this explanation lacks of offshore drilling knowledge unfortunately yes it is true that oil has experienced a strong positive momentum and now trades above  per barrel i would say so what nevertheless it is not true that the offshore drillers have enjoyed any positive effects from this oil rally and in fact the basic market situation is getting much worse since early march the offshore drilling industry shallow and deep water as well has not improved and the tendering activity has totally vanished beside some rare contract extensions negotiated at a dismal day rate it is a fact that no one can refute on the other side m dublin lawyer for hercules offshore talked about unsuccessful sale process to explain why hero needs to return to chapter  i would argue that the company has been extremely slow and notoriously inefficient in this sale process shareholders would like to see what has been done in this domain since emerging from the first bankruptcy can we use procrastination the second argument about the potential cash burn rate is more convincing and quite appealing i estimated a cash burn rate of approximately  million per quarter which is pretty close to the amount advanced by m dublin  million at the end of  nevertheless m andrew glenn said that shareholders were expecting this loss of cash in  and were holding on for a return to profitability in  to support this thinking he said recent forecasts put out by the company show hercules will be back in the black next year however shareholders that will be pushed out if the companys new bankruptcy scenario plays out wont be around to enjoy those profits and neither will hercules hercules plans to shut down its business and sell off assets in chapter  with some of the proceeds going to shareholders if they support its plan and concluded that hercules offshore doesnt belong to a bankruptcy court and estimated that the lenders are orchestrating the liquidation of this company mr glenn said noting that hercules is in chapter  not because of unrelenting gloom in the oil industry but because lenders want to cash in even if it kills the company i have to agree with centerbridge partners on this subject and said that the lenders were not confident enough to let hercules offshore getting its hands on the  million in escrow for the hercules highlander thereby used the first pretext to claim a breach federal bankruptcy watchdogs are weighing the appointment of an official committee of equity stakeholders in herculess chapter  case centerbridge is urging that a shareholder panel be named hercules said a shareholder committee could cause delay that risks plunging the company into a freefall bankruptcy in a freefall hercules would be forced into fast sales of its assets rather than the controlled sales that the company thinks will bring the best value the judge however seemed inclined to let shareholders weigh in on the question of herculess future i am concerned that the interests of equity be fully represented judge kevin carey said at tuesdays hearing in the us bankruptcy court in wilmington del he rejected urging from hercules to set a july  date to confirm its chapter  plan which is being circulated for shareholder votes now centerbridge is urging that the confirmation hearing be pushed off to give an equity committee time to investigate and take a stand on herculess future m dublin heros lawyer said the following efforts to find a buyer that would take over the operating company drew only non cash bids in amounts insufficient to cover the debt he added as we know hercules offshore handed the hercules highlander over to a subsidiary of maersk drilling getting out from under an obligation to pay  million to complete the rig lenders reclaimed the  million escrowed funds on a final note m glenn said that the sale of the hercules highlander will be a major focus this part is quite strange because i do not think hero has anything to do with the rig and has nothing to sale it would be really important that the company takes the time to explain in detail the status of the hercules highlander and if the company can claim any cash which i doubt conclusion i do not see this situation as a positive event for common shareholders if centerbridge is successful in his attempt hercules offshore will be forced to sell assets quickly and at an extremely distressed level that may or may not cover the debt and leave shareholders with a perfect zero on the other hand this second bankruptcy will allow time to sell the assets at higher price and eventually gives a potential cash distribution for the common shareholders i do not think it will be high but it will be better than zero at least again as i said in my preceding article do not count your chickens before they hatched i recommend to stay away for hero now because it is too

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
