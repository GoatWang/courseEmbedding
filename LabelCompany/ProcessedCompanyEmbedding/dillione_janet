health services business unit siemens healthcare part  august   by root  reprints dillione says meaningful use has clinical software in the spotlight and the soarianpharmacy integration is ready for primetimecoming in at number five in this year’s hci   siemens healthcare is clearly a powerhouse among the industry’s vendors what’s more the organization is one of only two vendors that offer core clinical functionality to hospitals such as emr and cpoe while also playing heavily in the pacs ris and modality space the other being ge healthcare it  recently hci editorinchief anthony guerra had a chance to chat with ceo janet dillione about where the company stands – and is going – in the industry’s hitechfueled environment   guerra what are some of the main projects siemens is working on dillione obviously the number one topic right now is arra but with or without arra we would have been very very busy anyway because both on the clinical and financial side we’re rolling out very large releases to our customers we also have a product we don’t talk much about that we roll out in the rest of the world it has a very low tco total cost of ownership that we take to the emerging market which is also a focus for us we’re gearing up to enter china and other markets with that we’re already live with that product line in south africa and egypt and turkey   as i like to tell people a lot of times i think we are as you would imagine very judgmental and tough on ourselves clearly soarian has been harder than we expected it’s taking longer and costing more when you take a closer look though and look at who has launched new product lines in the last  years you see that we’ve not done it once we’ve done it twice when i need a moment of sanity i remind myself of that and understand why this is so hard guerra how would you describe the way you’re bringing customers on to soarian are you being aggressive are you gently nudging them along or can they stay on invision as long as they want dillione obviously they can stay invision will be around a very very long time we actually took a look at it years ago and it almost gets silly when you look at how much professional services and resources it would take to move such a large customer base onto soarian – the numbers are stunning so it will be a customer choice issue however what we are doing with arra is each and every customer of ours is getting an arra roadmap we’re going in and doing an assessment of their current ehr status where are they red green yellow and given that what do they must do to make sure they’re in a position for meaningful use some of the customers – for us and i’m sure other vendors – will be fine no matter how meaningful use is defined but for the other customers you then start to have a discussion about the clinical investment you need to make do you want to continue to make it with invision or is it time for you to transition to soarian and that usually becomes somewhat selfevident as you start to do that ehr assessment and then see the gaps that they’re looking to fill   guerra are you trying that to make the point that it’s easier to get there with soarian   dillione no i don’t know that it’s easier because it’s going to depend on where a customer is in terms of their own implementation status again we have many invision customers that will get meaningful use immediately i think certainly the investments in soarian are ones that a customer can make and make once and it’s going to last them a very long time because soarian is a newer product line i mean there are certainly attributes in soarian of usability of openness of the web technology that are clear advantages when you’re trying to penetrate a clinical workplace and get your clinicians excited   guerra i read over the story david raths did recently and i was also looking at the klas midterm report and it seems you’ve got quite a bit more customers on soarian clinicals than on soarian financials does that mean you’re getting more adoption on the clinical side and is that because people don’t like to tamper with their revenue cycle   dillione all of your above statements are true i actually spent a good portion of my career on the revenue cycle side of healthcare and got into the financial side a few years ago one of the interesting things about financials is that the decision making is a little bit more autocratic because usually it’s a straight shot up through the cfo your supposition is correct cash is king cash is a tremendously important asset right now we find folks being extremely risk averse because the credit markets are so tight so cash is phenomenally importantpages   next › last » related insightswebinars solving data overload how cleveland clinic achieved
