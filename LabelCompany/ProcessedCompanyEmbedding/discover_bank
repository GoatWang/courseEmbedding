it too how do i use a chip card you can use chip cards in one of two ways if you are at a merchant location that does not have chipenabled terminals you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual at merchant locations that already accept chip cards youll be prompted to insert your card into the chipenabled terminal be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed when do i swipe when do i insert when in doubt swipe your chip debit card if the terminal is chip enabled it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead where can i use my discover debit card with chip technology your discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today when retailers update their terminals to accept chips

pin will change because of this we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card including any automatic bill payments please note that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card then only that person will receive a new chip debit card how does the chip work when you insert your chip debit card at a chipenabled terminal the embedded microchip generates unique dynamic data for each transaction this makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information which in turn can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account what are the benefits chip technology provides an additional layer of card security chip cards make it difficult for hackers to copy and use your debit card information when used at chipenabled terminals other benefits include ease of use its still a debit card so just use it like before once merchants adopt this technology the terminals will prompt you to insert

swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual at merchant locations that already accept chip cards youll be prompted to insert your card into the chipenabled terminal be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed when do i swipe when do i insert when in doubt swipe your chip debit card if the terminal is chip enabled it will recognize that your
