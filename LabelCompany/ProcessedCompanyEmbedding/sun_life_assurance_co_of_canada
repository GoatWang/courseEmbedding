one of montreals largest whitecollar employers one of the top corporations in canada as well as a global player in the life insurance field for the first half of the th century the city of montreal had been the economic hub of canada but it was losing ground to toronto as early as  torontos economic activity surpassed montreals with regards to stock market trading and capitalization the advent in the s of political and terrorist movements demanding the independence of quebec from canada cast a pallor of uncertainty over the business community in  the newly elected sovereigntist quebec

that if they had only warned us we could have worked something out the downsizing of sun lifes montreal office did not take place overnight transfers and moves occurred on a departmental basis and did not commence until several months after the announcement the transfer of sun lifes head office from montreal to toronto is viewed by many to be the start of an exodus of corporate entities from
