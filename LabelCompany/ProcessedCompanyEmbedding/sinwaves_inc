sinwaves home sinwaves inc creating a wireless roadside network infrastructure for the future of safe effective roadways why make roads safer sinwaves inc is developing an internet of things iot communication platform that will be placed on street signs to deploy a vehicletoroadside vr communication network for the advancement and safety of driverassisted and autonomous vehicles sinwaves has been designing a unit that is lowcost ultralow power and easily programmable the unit is configured to transmit information to vehicles wirelessly and elicit a response similar to how humans interpret current visual cues for example when a driver sees a stop sign the response is preparing to stop currently advanced driver assistant systems adas and autonomous vehicles rely on visual machine sensing systems that are degraded in periods of darkness weather and obstruction sinwaves proposes an optimized communication protocol structured around efficient message transmission at ultralow operating power to quickly detect and respond to moving vehicles with minimal energy usage sinwaves is developing a roadside communication network rcn by integrating the methodologies of internet of things iot vehicular networks and wireless sensor networks to provide a new communication platform that will enable roadsidetovehicle rv communication this system will digitalize the current roadside infrastructure enabling communication with oncoming vehicles providing advanced roadway flow control conditions roadside infrastructure in the form of street signs traffic lights railroad crossings construction zones and other road related entities will be able to wirelessly communicate their message to a recipient thus facilitating safer smarter decisions subscribe to our mailing list

developing a vehicle communciation network for a safer future why we are developing such a network  roadside infrastructure has evolved significantly over the last  years the modern driver experiences different visual cues consisting of road markers traffic lights and street signs human drivers can easily recognize these visual cues that are designed to convey short simple messages however visual information is difficult for machines to detect process and respond to to overcome this difficulty and accelerate the deployment of selfdriving cars sinwaves sees an opportunity to create a “smart” transportation infrastructure through the implementation of a roadside communication network rcn a unit placed on a street sign will transmit information to approaching vehicles alerting of upcoming events the driver whether person or machine receives the information with more than adequate response time to make safer smarter decisions navigational technologies have tried to provide additional road characteristics such as speed limits but without continual software updates their navigational context data can become oudated mapping software best provides maps and directions but can’t always convey changes like closures and detours due to events like construction and power outages road maintenance and construction often involves alterations or detours to the original flow of traffic in addition to adding other hazards like equipment and personnel into the street the latest technical advances in vehicles use visual object detection andor radar to determine their surroundings these solutions can provide the driver with additional cognitive awareness helping them to make better and safer driving decisions each approach has its limitations that become apparent when working with autonomous vehicles the roadside infrastructure proposed by sinwaves can rapidly overcome some of the difficulties encountered by selfdriving cars distributing these units into the field alleviates demands that would otherwise be placed on the cloud infrastructure because necessary information is available at the point of interest by moving from cloudbased systems to locationbased services field information is always correct because it is able to be updated quickly for example when road work disturbs the normal flow of traffic construction units are placed in the field providing advanced notice to approaching vehicles of route modification and personnel at work detailed realtime field data as descripted isn’t always available by cloud the current infrastructure needs to be updated the next revolution will not be adding more bridges it will be optimizing current roadways pedestrians need to be addressed in the future of a connected infrastructure sīnwaves is developing technology
