careers what is wealth management income vs growth dias strategies dynamic approach personalized solutions why choose gfpc fiduciary vs suitability institutional vs retail financial partner contact who is global financial private capital an established relationshipbased organization putting their clients’ interests first global financial private capital llc is an independently owned sec registered investment advisor ria whose goal is to restore investor trust and confidence in the financial system through the creation of client relationships based on full fiduciary disclosure and transparency of action investors deserve a credible alternative source of advice compared to those products offered by the major financial corporations who have been described as “too big to fail” as an independent organization global financial has the freedom to offer unbiased advice without the potential for conflicts of interest often present within these larger broker dealers by taking the time to understand our clients’ financial and lifestyle needs and aspirations we aim to align our advice in the same direction as our clientele global financial comprises a number of special areas of expertise all of which work together as our clients require to provide a comprehensive wealth management solution personalized financial planning successful longterm relationships usually start with both parties sharing with each other their mutual goals and aspirations we believe this should also be true for prosperous financial relationships there are two types of financial organization those you’ve heard of and those you haven’t heard of  “the big companies you’ve heard of” these are busy with bailouts restructuring legal battles and staff turnover  “the companies you have yet to hear of” is now the time to look for a more personal financial organization the first stage of a relationship with global financial involves your personal financial advisor taking the time to listen to you and understand your story where you have been where you would like to go from here and what makes you financially comfortable they will also outline their beliefs and the areas in which global financial might typically bring value the financial relationship together with your global financial advisor you will then have access to a group of qualified experienced investment advisor representatives  of which are currently certified financial planner™ professionals this team is led by our company president geoffrey a frazier cfp® the certified financial planner board of standards inc benefits the public by upholding the cfp® mark as the recognized standard of excellence for competent and ethical personal financial planning under your direction our financial planning team will analyze your current financial situation and suggest potential areas of improvement our financial planning services are available on a onetoone personalized basis and include risk income and cost planning and analyses institutionallevel investment management global aims to bring institutionallevel asset management to your kitchen table institutional money management is not just for the ultrawealthy elite and large institutional investors you’ve worked hard and earned the right to enjoy similarly sophisticated and transparent asset management services that larger investors have benefitted from for decades in our opinion the key to consistent investment returns and volatility reduction is asset allocation – a focus on dynamically selecting the most attractive areas to invest in while avoiding the riskiest taking into account the everchanging economic and investment environment our investment philosophy is a proactive handson diversified and flexible approach to seeking riskadjusted asset classes with the potential for principal growth or consistent income in other words “buy and hold” may not be right for all markets and all investors we prioritize capital preservation while seeking to participate in market opportunities across a wide range of asset classes and geographical regions decisions are screened through our investment committee with the aim of incorporating an element of risk reduction quality control and value investing within a disciplined investment and analysis process we are privileged to advise large institutions who demand a high degree of accountability and due diligence with our use of independent thirdparties who validate that all our daily transactions reconcilewith the actual account holdings account custodians who ensure we handle all client accounts in compliance with financial regulations we are able to provide enhanced peace of mind for our investors the global financial advisor client service and fiduciary advice global financial’s affiliated advisors are typically local independent business owners they don’t answer to corporate management structures strictures shareholder profit motives and bonus targets they answer to you at global financial we believe financial advice should be more than big company sales staff offering financial products that they have a financial interest in selling to you is this in the best interests of the client we believe financial advice should be about building relationships every global financial advisor has access to special independent experts including investment research and analysis financial planning institutional compliance and quality control their job is to work closely with you to ensure your needs are being served our goal is to offer a high level of client service—some might say the “oldfashioned” way each global financial advisor seeks to provide their clients with the opportunity to become part of a familystyle community as a global financial client you should expect to meet other clients and share your experiences and views by adopting the fiduciary standard as their guiding “standard of client care” a global financial advisor is required to put the interests of their clients first and fully disclose associated costs and potential conflicts of interest in our opinion this is a higher standard of care than the “brokerage suitability” standard that most large company brokers still follow our hope is that clients and regulators continue to embrace the fiduciary standard as a way to uncover and prevent many of the practices which led to the credit crisis recession budget deficit and wall street protests we appreciate and respect how hard you’ve worked and saved throughout your life with that in mind we take our role as the financial advisor of your pre and postretirement goals very seriously it is a true honor for us to be entrusted with this responsibility july   will rising rates cause stocks to crash view mike sorrentinos latest blog
