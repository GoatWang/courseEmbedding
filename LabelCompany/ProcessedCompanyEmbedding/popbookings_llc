your profile on the popbookings system each future agency you connect with will be able to access the same profile no need to ever fill out another form again   building a strong profile agencies are looking for the best staff to work their events your profile is set up so that it displays exactly what the agency is looking for when they book events what you see in the layout is what they see so work to make it look nice empty sections and low quality pictures don’t go far to show how awesome you are   uploading documents many agencies ask for additional info that is not a part of your profile like a w or liquor license the upload section can be found on the “documents” tab on the left side of your profile just click the “add” button under each document for security reasons you have to upload documents in a jpg or pdf format note if you are trying to upload a resume that is a word document open the document in word and click “save as” a pdf getting booked let’s face it the reason you are here is to get some work the best place to start is the job board tab on your profile agencies post upcoming jobs here that are open for applications make sure to check which city the job is in before you apply to work under events you’ll find all of the jobs your agency has specifically invited you to the agency has looked at your profile and determined that you will be the best fit for this particular job so look at each event to determine your availability   if you are signing up for the first time this section might feel a little empty don’t worry the bookings will come when an

messaging your agency this is a great way to get noticed and start building a relationship with your agency   there are two forms of chat you will use with the app direct messaging this is for more confidential conversation or asking the agency about information directly relevant to you you can message your agency direct by going to the “mesages” tab on the popbookings app and click on the agency icon group chat this is for conversations with your fellow staff at the event or to get information from the agency relevant to the group important remember to use your powers of group chat wisely nobody likes spam if it a message that is only relevant to you use a direct message to your agency pro tip sending a friendly opening message to your agent or letting them know your availability is a nice way to break the ice checking in to an event we have thrown away the paper timesheets 💁 byefelicia now instead of filling out paperwork to have your team lead sign at an event you can use geo checkins these take a digital snapshot of your location and time you got to the event to send to your agency after the event is over click the checkout button and you are all set note

growing nationally chicks in your shirt website x more productive  increase in active profiles  increase in database size before popbookings i was only able to focus on one client at a time now i’m able to pick up new clients in other states and other citieserick chicks in your shirt ceo erick comellas of chicks in your shirt was frustrated with the status quo in the event staffing industry finding booking and paying talent was a constant struggle requiring multiple messy spreadsheets and tons of unanswered emails then popbookings’ specialized event staffing platform streamlined erick’s processes and gave him the time and energy to take his business to new heights chicks in your shirt is an event staffing agency specializing in promotional talent they engage their network of intelligent and attractive models to provide a fresh way to influence consumers at trade shows product launches sporting events and more their ethos of passionate professionalism sets them apart and inspires their talent and clients alike the data management nightmare if you work in the event staffing industry you know that managing your data and processes can be a total nightmare the behindthescenes work of discovering engaging and tracking talented workers for multiple events across a variety of locations requires time and energy that could be better spent growing your business for years agencies like chicks in your shirt have struggled to develop and refine their own internal processes but the best options available are complicated spreadsheets and unsophisticated recruiting platforms like craigslist the result a time and effortintensive process that complicates your job and distracts you from opportunities to expand and thrive as erick attests “doing everything through emails and spreadsheets made it very difficult for me to gain more clients and do more work on a daily basis because i felt like i was constantly running behind” popbookings provides the solution luckily for the event staffing industry popbookings founders erika klotz and scott hanson created their platform from the inside out with your needs in mind their experience running an agency gave them firsthand insight into the uphill battle of managing hundreds of talent and event listings they envisioned a simple integrated platform that would accelerate the event staffing process from beginning to end and then they built it from recruiting and booking talent to managing events and tracking payment information popbookings’ platform provides an intuitive interface that allows staffing companies like chicks in your shirt to manage important data and processes with remarkable ease and efficiency instead of fighting with clumsy spreadsheets and disconnected communication platforms popbookings equips agencies with a onestop shop that meets all their needs spend your time growing agency owners like erick comellas see results with popbookings where he used to spend hours each week managing vital data such as talent profiles and availability today he uses that time to book new talent land new contracts and grow his business since joining popbookings he’s been able to significantly increase both his talent pool and client list erick says “one of the main challenges was organizing my data and being able to have a quick turnaround for clients as far as who was available because popbookings is specifically tailored to the event staffing industry the design and user interface made managing my data easy” he estimates that he’s cut recruiting and booking times in half as a result of the popbookings platform “before i was only able to focus on one client at a time to make sure they were served correctly now i’m able to pick up new clients in other states and other cities” chicks in your shirt is based in orlando and has provided staff for many events in central and south florida but erick has recently been contracted to staff events on the east coast and in the southwest as well one major victory for chicks in your shirt was gaining a new national account for xyience energy drink erick attributes his recent expansion to popbookings’ efficiency “a lot of that has to do with what i’ve been able to do with the popbookings system i can provide better service with a faster turnaround” spend your time growing popbookings integrated event dashboard and talent database provide staffing agencies with everything you need to attract book and manage ambassadors and event listings their streamlined staffing solution keeps your data organized and accessible so your team and your talent are on the same page in addition the talent mobile app allows for instantaneous communication between you and your promoters whether it’s a job invite a booking confirmation or directions to the event while erick would prefer to keep the benefits of popbookings a secret from competitors he can’t help but be enthusiastic about the platform and how it’s helped chicks in your shirt grow “i would recommend popbookings because of the team behind the software they are experienced and well versed in the industry they know how to solve the problems we face” now it’s your turn are you ready to solve your data management problems and spend your time growing your business contact the popbookings team to
