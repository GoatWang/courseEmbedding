discussion applies generally to contracts owned by a natural person withdrawals if you withdraw funds from your contract before the annuity starting date irc section e usually deems taxable any amounts received to the extent that the accumulation value at the time you withdraw exceeds your investment in the contract the investment in the contract usually equals all premiums paid by the contractowner or on the contractowners behalf if you withdraw your entire accumulation under a contract you will be taxed only on the part that exceeds your investment in the contract annuity payments although tax consequences can vary with the income option you pick irc section b provides generally that before you recover the investment in the contract part of each annuity income payment is treated as recovery of your investment in the contract and can be excluded from your income after you recover your investment in the contract all additional annuity payments are fully taxable taxation of death benefit proceeds amounts may be paid from a contract because an owner has died if the payments are made in a single sum theyre taxed the same way a full withdrawal from the contract is taxed if they are distributed as annuity payments theyre taxed as annuity payments penalty tax on some withdrawals you may have to pay a penalty tax  percent of the amount treated as taxable income on some

investment return we further adjust the annuity unit value to reflect the fact that annuity payment amounts are redetermined only once a month or once a year depending on the revaluation method chosen the purpose of the adjustment is to equitably apportion any account gains or losses among those annuitants who receive annuity income for the entire period between valuation dates and those who start or stop receiving annuity income between the two dates in general from period to period your payments will increase if the net performance of the account is greater than a  percent net annual rate of

of annuities the following discussion assumes the contracts qualify as annuity contracts for federal income tax purposes see the sai for more information in general irc section  governs annuity taxation generally we believe an owner who is a natural person usually wont be taxed on increases in the value of a contract until there is a distribution ie the owner withdraws all or part of the accumulation or takes annuity payments assigning pledging or agreeing to assign or pledge any part of the accumulation usually will be considered a distribution withdrawals of accumulated investment earnings are taxable as ordinary income generally under the irc withdrawals are first allocated to investment earnings the owner of any annuity contract who is not a natural person such as a corporation or a trust generally must include in income any increase in the excess of the accumulation over the investment in the contract during the taxable year there are some exceptions to this and agents of prospective owners that are not natural persons may wish to discuss them with a competent tax advisor the following discussion applies generally to contracts owned by a natural person withdrawals if you withdraw funds from your contract before the annuity starting date irc section e usually deems taxable any amounts received to the extent that the accumulation value at the time you withdraw exceeds your investment in the contract the investment in the contract usually equals all premiums paid by the contractowner or on the contractowners behalf if you withdraw your entire accumulation under a contract you will be taxed only on the part that exceeds your investment in the contract annuity payments although tax consequences can vary with the income option you pick irc section b provides generally that before you recover the investment in the contract gross income does not include that fraction of any annuity income payments that equals the ratio of investment in the contract to the expected return at the annuity starting date after you recover your investment in the contract all additional annuity payments are fully taxable taxation of death benefit proceeds amounts may be paid from a contract because an owner has died if the payments are made in a single sum theyre taxed the same way a full withdrawal from the contract is taxed if they are distributed as annuity payments theyre taxed as annuity payments  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th penalty tax on some withdrawals you may have to pay a penalty tax  percent of the amount treated as taxable income on some withdrawals however there is usually no penalty on distributions  on or after you reach   after you die or after the annuitant dies if the owner isnt an individual  after you become disabled or  that are part of a series of substantially equal periodic at least annual payments for your life or life expectancy or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of you and your beneficiary possible tax changes legislation is proposed from time to time that would change the taxation of annuity contracts it is possible that such legislation could be enacted and that it could be retroactive that is effective prior to the date of the change you should consult a tax adviser regarding legislative developments and their effect on the contract transfers assignments or exchanges of a contract transferring contract ownership designating an annuitant payee or other beneficiary who is not also the owner or exchanging a contract can have other tax consequences that we dont discuss here if youre thinking about any of those transactions contact a tax advisor withholding annuity distributions usually are subject to withholding for the recipients federal income tax liability at rates that vary according to the type of distribution and the recipients tax status however recipients can usually choose not to have tax withheld from distributions multiple contracts in determining gross income section e generally treats as one contract all tiaacref life and tiaa nonqualified deferred annuity contracts to the same owner during any calendar year this could affect when income is taxable and how much might be subject to the  percent penalty tax see above consult a tax advisor before buying more than one annuity contract for the purpose of gaining a tax advantage

regulations under it provide that separate account investments underlying a contract must be adequately diversified for it to qualify as an annuity contract under irc section  the separate account intends to comply with the diversification requirements of the regulations under section h this will affect how we make investments under the irc you could be considered the owner of the assets of the separate account used to support your contract if this happens youd have to include income and gains from the separate account assets in your gross income the irs has published rulings stating that a variable contractowner will be considered the owner of separate account assets if the contractowner has any powers that the actual owner of the assets might have such as the ability to exercise investment control the treasury department says that the regulations on investment diversification dont provide guidance about when and how investor control of a segregated asset accounts investment could cause the investor rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets for tax purposes the treasury department has also stated that the irs would issue regulations or rulings clarifying the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular accounts without being treated as owners of the underlying assets your ownership rights under the contract are similar but not identical to those described by the irs in rulings that held that contractowners were not owners of separate account assets so the irs therefore might not rule the same way in your case tiaacref life reserves the right to change the contract if necessary to help prevent your being considered the owner of the separate accounts assets required distributions to qualify as an annuity contract under section s of the irc a contract must provide that a if any owner dies on or after the annuity starting date but before all amounts under the contract have been distributed the remaining amounts will be distributed at least as quickly as under the method being used when the owner died and b if any owner dies before the annuity starting date all amounts under the contract will be distributed within five years of the date of death so long as the distributions begin within a year of the owners death the irs will consider these requirements satisfied for any part of the owners interest payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary and distributed over the beneficiarys life or over a period that cannot exceed the beneficiarys life expectancy a designated beneficiary is the person the owner names to assume ownership when the owner dies a designated beneficiary must be a natural person but if a contractowners spouse is the designated beneficiary such spouse can continue the contract when such contractowner dies the contract is designed to comply with section s tiaacref life will review the contract and amend it if necessary to make sure that it continues to comply with the sections requirements performance information total return information for the separate account total return quotations for the investment accounts of the separate account may be advertised total return quotations will reflect all aspects of the investment accounts return average annual total returns are determined by finding the average annual compounded rate of return over a period that reflects the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical  investment made at the beginning of the period through the end of that period according to the following formula p  tn  ev where p  hypothetical initial payment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years in the period ev  ending value of the hypothetical investment at the end of the   or  year period to derive the total return quotations from this formula the percentage net change in the value of the  investment from the beginning of the period to the end of such period cumulative total return is determined cumulative total returns simply reflect the change in value of an investment over a stated period since the accumulation unit value is a total return unit value that reflects the investment experience of the particular investment account of the separate account and all expense deductions made against the assets of the separate account the ending value or ev of the  hypothetical investment is determined by applying the percentage change in the accumulation unit value over the period to the hypothetical initial payment of  less the current deductions from premiums  we then solve the equation for t to derive the average annual compounded rate of return for the separate account over the span of the period and the resulting total return quotation is carried out to the nearest hundredth of one percent performance comparisons performance information for the separate account and its investment accounts may be compared in advertisements sales literature and reports to

contractowners should keep in mind that the composition of the investments in the reported averages will not be identical to that of the separate account and that certain formula calculations ie yield may differ from index to index in addition there can be no assurance that the separate account will continue its performance as compared to such indices illustrating compounding tax deferral and expense deductions we may illustrate in advertisements sales literature and reports to contractowners or annuitants the effects of tax deferral andor compounding of earnings on an investment in the separate account we may do this using a hypothetical investment earning a specified rate of return to illustrate the effects of compounding we would show how the total return from an investment of the same dollar amount earning the same or different interest rate varies depending on when the investment was made to illustrate the effects of tax deferral we will show how the total return from an investment of the same dollar amount earning the same or different interest rates for individuals in the same tax bracket would vary between taxdeferred and taxable investments we may also illustrate in advertisements sales literature and reports to contractowners or annuitants the effect of an investment funds expenses on total return over time we may do this using a hypothetical investment earning a specified rate of return we would show how the total return net of expenses from an investment of the same dollar amount in funds with the same investment results but different expense deductions varies increasingly over time in the alternative we would show the difference in the dollar amount of total expense charges paid over time by an investor in two or more different funds that have the same annual total return but different assetbased expense charges we may also compare the separate accounts expense charges to those of other variable annuities and other investment products

considerations over the past several years tiaa and cref have added many new investment vehicles to their line of products the growing family of tiaa and cref products is designed to provide additional investment options for those who want to diversify their holdings most experts recommend diversification as a good strategy for retirement and other longterm investing both because a diversified portfolio offers a degree of safety from the volatility of specific markets and because it allows the investor to benefit from the potential for growth in several different types of investments the tiaacref life funds stock index fund offered by the separate account is suited for people who are seeking growth and are able to make longterm investments although past performance is no guarantee of future results in the past stocks have outperformed many other types of investments investors who seek to counter the effects of inflation on their longterm investments should therefore consider investing in stocks the stock index fund could be an appropriate investment for someone who is seeking to supplement his or her retirement income to purchase a retirement home finance an extended trip or build a fund for philanthropic purposes of course there is no guarantee that the investment objective of that or any other fund will be met before investing you should consider whether your pension plan and social security payments will meet your retirement needs you should look at your assets and liabilities to help determine whether you need to invest more money to help provide retirement income you should consider how much time you have until retirement and the effect of inflation and taxes on your savings and investments you should also keep in mind that experts say that people need  to  of their preretirement income to maintain the same standard of living after retirement before contributing to a contract you should consider whether you have already reached your contribution limit on your k or b savings plans consult your tax advisor to learn more about these limits you should also consider what types of investments are best suited for you and your current needs in particular you should consider the tax treatment of a variable annuity as compared with a standard mutual fund product with annuities earnings generally grow taxdeferred and investors are provided the option of lifetime income upon retirement however annuities may have restrictions on withdrawals before age   and thus may not be suitable for goals other than retirement we may compare annuities to mutual funds in sales literature and advertisements you should also consider the risks of any investment relative to its potential rewards in particular you should be aware of the risk that arises from market timing market timing is an investment technique whereby amounts are transferred from one category of investment to another for example from stocks to bonds based upon a perception of how each of those categories of investments will perform relative to the others at a particular time investors who engage in market timing run the risk that they may transfer out of a type of investment with a rising market value or transfer into a type of investment with a falling market value we do not endorse the practice of market timing the variety of issues to consider highlights the importance of the support and services that we provide these services include  retirement and life insurance planning expertise from professional counselors rather than commissioned salespeople  detailed information through quarterly transaction reports newsletters and other publications about retirement planning and  seminars individual counseling an information center and hour

opinion on these financial statements based on our audits tiaacref lifes financial statements for the period december   commencement of operations through december   were audited by other auditors whose report dated march   expressed an adverse opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles because the financial statements were presented in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the new york state insurance department and an unqualified opinion as to their conformity with such statutory accounting practices we conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion as described in note  to the financial statements tiaacref life presents its financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices which practices differ from generally accepted accounting principles the differences between such statutory accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles and the effect on the accompanying financial statements are described in note  in our opinion because of the effects of the matter described in the preceding paragraph the  and  statutorybasis financial statements referred to above do not present fairly in

significant accounting policies tiaacref lifes statutorybasis financial statements have been prepared on the basis of statutory accounting practices prescribed by the new york state insurance department department a comprehensive basis of accounting that differs from generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of tiaacref lifes financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies consistently followed by tiaacref life valuation of investments bonds mortgage loans and shortterm investments debt securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of acquisition are generally stated at amortized cost for loanbacked bonds and structured securities amortized cost is determined using actual and anticipated cash flows under the retrospective method anticipated prepayments are based on lifetodate payment speeds using historical cash flows and internal estimates separate account assets are stated at market value accounting for investments investment transactions are accounted for as of the date the investments are settled settlement date realized capital gains and losses on investment transactions are accounted for under the specific identification method policy reserves policy reserves are determined in accordance with standard valuation methods approved by the department and are computed in accordance with standard actuarial formulas the reserves established utilize assumptions for interest at an average rate of approximately  mortality and other risks insured such reserves establish a sufficient provision for all contractual benefits guaranteed under policy provisions asset valuation reserve the asset valuation reserve avr which covers all invested asset classes is an explicit liability reserve required by the national association of insurance commissioners naic and is intended to provide for potential future credit and equity losses formula calculations determine the required contribution amounts and contributions to the avr are reported as transfers from surplus interest maintenance reserve the interest maintenance reserve imr is a liability reserve required by the naic which accumulates realized capital gains and losses resulting from interest rate fluctuations such capital gains and losses are amortized out of the imr under the grouped method of amortization as an adjustment to net investment income over the remaining lives of the assets sold all net capital gains on shortterm investments were fully amortized out of the imr by the end of each period presented income and expenses

tiaacref life insurance company notes to statutorybasis financial statements continued note significant accounting policies concluded visions in the accompanying statements of operations are based on taxes actually paid or anticipated to be paid under the tax sharing agreement generally accepted accounting principles gaap is a comprehensive basis of accounting that is comprised of the authoritative accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board the american institute of certified public accountants and other standard setting bodies the differences between gaap and statutory accounting practices could have a material effect on tiaacref lifes financial statements and the primary differences can be summarized as follows under gaap o the avr is eliminated and if necessary valuation allowances are established as contra assets based on assetspecific analyses rather than the formulabased avr being reflected as a liability reserve o the imr is eliminated and realized gains and losses resulting from interest rate fluctuations are reported as a component of net income rather than being accumulated in and subsequently amortized out of the imr o policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the policies issued rather than being charged to operations as incurred o policy reserves are based on estimates of expected mortality and interest rather than being based on statutory mortality and interest requirements o longterm bond investments considered to be available for sale are carried at fair value rather than at amortized cost o deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities rather than not being recognized management believes that the effects of these differences would increase tiaacref lifes total capital if gaap were implemented reclassification certain amounts in the  financial statements
