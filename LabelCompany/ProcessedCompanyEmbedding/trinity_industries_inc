guardrail manufacturing and installation companies spig industry and selco construction services filed a federal false claims act fca suit against trinity highway products llc trinity manufactures under license the et plus system—a guardrail end terminal system designed by the texas am transportation institute tti mr harman alleged that trinity did not properly notify the federal highway administration fhwa in  when trinity changed the et plusâ guide channel from five inches to four trinity made the modification upon the recommendation of tti which had successfully crash tested the product it was revealed in a series of investigative articles published by television station wpritv in may  prior to may   fhwa did not expect product submitters to notify fhwa of “nonsignificant” modifications if the modification was though to have no effect on how the device would slow stop or redirect the vehicle harman further alleged that these were costcutting changes that resulted in unsafe products being deployed on us highways automobile accidents involving the et plus system have involved guardrails penetrating vehicles and causing injury to the driver lawsuits regarding the guardrails causing injury to motorists were pending in us courts in  in october  the federal lawsuit resulted in a fraud jury verdict of  million which under fca was tripled to  million in june  the us district court in the eastern district of texas certified the verdict and assessed the final penalty at  million trinity has appealed the case to the fifth circuit court of appeals in january  nevada suspended the use of the guardrails due to trinitys lack of disclosure by october   states had suspended new installations of the end terminal a report by the university of alabama at birmingham which examined data from almost a decade of crash reports concluded the et plus guardrail end terminal to be nearly three times more likely to result in fatality than the previous version of the end terminal in january  the fhwa commissioned a peer review of the university of alabama at birmingham report all four reviewers raised concerns about limitations or flaws in the study’s methodology which led all of the reviewers to question the validity of the study’s findings and conclusions in october  the fhwa issued a memorandum requesting information from state transportation departments regarding the et plus performance in addition the fhwa requested the guardrail be retested trinity voluntarily stopped shipping the et plus until the additional crash testing requested by the fhwa could be completed up to that point  states had stopped installation of new et plus guardrails pending further testing the company conducted a series of eight crash tests at inch and inch heights to conform to the prevailing standard for guardrails of this type nchrp report  after a review by the fhwa and an independent expert in march  the fhwa announced that the et plus® et plus passed all eight crash tests and that the product remained eligible for federal reimbursement in march  the virginia department of transportation announced plans to replace et plus guardrails in march  federal officials said the design met safety standards during crash tests in september  the fhwa and the american association of state highway and transportation officials published a joint task force report titled “safety analysis of extruding wbeam guardrail end terminal crashes” the report concluded that there are no unique performance limitations that can be attributed to the etplus that there are realworld conditions that exceed the performance expectation of all end terminal systems and that additional crash testing of all existing report compliant end terminals would be irrelevant and uninformative the report also cited installation maintenance and repair as factors affecting product performance on october   trinity highway products announced that it will resume shipping the

to tim timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc thank you theis and good morning everyone trinitys second quarter financial results came in slightly ahead of our expectations generally speaking when industry order levels reach low points we begin to see strategic purchases occurring in our businesses during the second quarter this occurred in our railcar manufacturing business im pleased with the order level our rail group received in what remains a highly competitive market i continue to be impressed with the way our businesses are adjusting to changes in demand theyre highly flexible and quick to respond when opportunities surface our employees are doing a good job confronting the challenges associated with the complexities of todays business environment uncertainties associated with the us economy and the political landscape continued to impact demand for the majority of our products a mixture of uncertainty and optimism persists in many of the end markets our businesses serve our customers appear optimistic regarding potential opportunities that could surface if a major infrastructure spending program is approved by congress during the second quarter our railcar leasing business generated strong earnings score from their leasing operations in addition they sold  million leased railcars through our railcar investment platform we expect to grow our owned and managed lease fleet this year and are optimistic with respect to selling additional portfolios of leased railcars to investors that participate in our railcar investment platform overall im pleased with our companys ability to make prompt and orderly transitions when market conditions shift our industrial manufacturing construction aggregates and railcar leasing businesses strive to do their best in every market environment and constantly work at strengthening their competitive positions trinity remains wellpositioned to capitalize on opportunities to enhance shareholder value i will now turn it over to bill for his remarks william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc thank you tim and good morning everyone during the second quarter the financial performance of the energy equipment group reflected mixed demand conditions for the end markets we serve for the quarter revenues were in line with last year higher volumes in our wind towers and utility structures business were offset by weak demand in our businesses that serve the oil and gas markets a decline in second quarter operating profit compared to last year reflects the softness in the oil and gas endmarkets at the end of the second quarter our wind tower backlog totaled  million providing stable production visibility through  included in the guidance james will provide is a planned reduction in fourth quarter deliveries as our customers reduce yearend inventory we remain encouraged about the demand outlook for new wind farm installations during the next few years given the production tax credit and improvements in wind turbine technology during the second quarter we continued to see improved visibility and increased demand levels for utility structures the second quarter results for our inland barge group reflect significant volume reductions on a yearoveryear basis as weak market conditions persist for the quarter the group reported revenues of  million and a slightly betterthanbreakeven operating profit overcapacity and declines in freight movements that transport goods along the inland waterways continued to create significant headwinds we received orders for new barges totaling  million during the second quarter bringing the backlog to  million the backlog is divided between the back half of  and  i am pleased with the efforts our team is making to reduce cost while meeting the needs of our customers our plants are positioned to respond to future changes in demand the construction products group reported solid results for the quarter revenues were down compared to the same quarter last year on lower volumes in our highway products business while operating profit increased to  million the group reported a  operating margin compared to  last year on the strength of our construction aggregates business and improved efficiencies within our highway products business the group continues to be on track for another strong year in  as demand for infrastructurerelated work remains a positive catalyst for our end markets we continue to be pleased with the performance of our construction aggregates business during the second quarter we acquired the assets of a small lightweight aggregate business that expands our geographic presence following quarterend we completed a  million acquisition of the assets of efficiency production a trench shoring business as a reminder trinity entered the shoring business in late  with a similar sized acquisition trench shoring is steel or aluminum equipment used in the underground construction industry with applications for water sewer utility and pipeline construction among others our original trench shoring acquisition is providing nice returns and is performing well the shoring business is wellaligned with our focus on infrastructure endmarkets in closing our businesses are responding effectively to the mixed demand conditions in the various endmarkets we maintain a positive outlook regarding longterm north american infrastructure needs and now ill turn the presentation over to steve d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc thank you bill good morning trinityrails performance for the second quarter came in slightly ahead of our project expectations the leasing group continued to deliver solid financial results maintaining the high lease fleet utilization while continuing to grow the lease fleet during the quarter operating profit from leasing operations increased by  yearoveryear and the group executed  million of leased railcar sales to institutional investors through our railcar investment vehicle or riv platform our owned partiallyowned and managed lease fleet has grown to more than  railcars providing a solid level of earnings stability as we continue to operate in a highly competitive railcar market our rail group delivered  railcars during the quarter showing an  improvement sequentially our operations team has positioned us well for further production increases in the second half of  we are encouraged by the improvement in railcar industry fundamentals yeartodate rail traffic continued an upward trajectory while train velocity declined and the surplus of idle railcars while still high is lower than peak levels experienced last year second quarter industry orders for new railcars totaled more than  and represented a significant strengthening from the levels reported by the industry during the last two years including the very weak level experienced in the first quarter of this year while the healthy level of industry orders and order inquiry activity during the second quarter is positive a sustained level of improvement is required before declaring a market recovery order inquiries thus far in the third quarter have been consistent with the second quarter our customers continue to express optimism concerning the direction of the economy while being very deliberate in making capital equipment decisions we are cautiously optimistic about trending market fundamentals the rail group received orders for  railcars in the second quarter representing a diverse mix of railcars serving various endmarkets these orders support both fleet replacement and business growth nearly  of the orders received during the quarter are for our leasing company i am particularly pleased with trinityrails ability to originate large leasing transactions with strong counterparties and long lease terms to secure new lease orders during the quarter this underscores the capability of our integrated rail manufacturing leasing and services business model and the growing scale of our riv platform our order backlog for newbuilt railcars at the end of the second quarter increased to  with a value of approximately  billion based on orders received during the second quarter the acceleration of certain frac sand deliveries and current inquiry levels we now anticipate fullyear  deliveries of approximately  railcars compared to our previous guidance of between  and  railcars the increase in production should result in improved production margins in the second half of  compared to the second quarter at the end of the second quarter more than  of our expected remaining  production is filled with either sold or leased railcars if order levels continued to improve we still have the ability to increase our production rate to meet demand for  deliveries at the end of the second quarter planned  deliveries account for approximately  of our backlog with the remainder scheduled through  the visibility provided by our production backlog is highly beneficial and significantly better than we have ever experienced in previous cycles i am pleased with the leasing groups operating performance during the second quarter as well on a yearoveryear basis leasing and management services revenues and profit from operations increased  and  respectively on high fleet utilization disciplined cost control and net new fleet additions partially offset by lower average lease rates during the quarter we added  leased railcars to our fleet this included a small secondary market acquisition we continue to see strong interest from institutional inventors to participate in our riv platform and anticipate fullyear leased railcar sales of between  million and  million unchanged from our previous guidance at this time we expect the cadence of quarterly leased railcar sales to be relatively even during the back half of the year lease fleet utilization increased yearoveryear to  and remains in line with the most recent two quarters we continue to focus on maintaining high lease fleet utilization while growing the fleet the lease pricing environment remains highly competitive however we see lease renewal rates firming at existing pricing levels with an average remaining lease term of  years lease expirations in  and  are within a manageable range that is consistent with prior years at the end of the second quarter our committed leased railcar backlog stood at  railcars with a value of approximately  million lease fleet maintenance and compliance costs while up  compared with the first quarter decreased  yearoveryear as weve mentioned on the previous call maintenance and compliance costs are expected to increase during the second half of the year as we perform services to remarket railcars and complete more regulatory compliance work our team is currently performing hm tank car modifications at our maintenance services centers while also providing regulatory compliance services for an increasing portion of our owned and managed lease fleets i am pleased with the operating improvements and flexibility of our expanded maintenance services capabilities our investment in maintenance services capabilities has positioned us to serve the hm tank car modification needs of our lease fleet and key customers as well as the longterm regulatory compliance requirements of our growing fleet we saw an increase during the second quarter in inquiries and orders for hm tank car modifications by third parties this pattern has continued into the third quarter we are working with our leasing customers and large fleet owners to schedule hm modifications as regulatory deadlines draw closer in summary i continue to be pleased with trinityrails financial results within a highly competitive railcar market in the current market environment we expect to continue to focus on optimizing our production efficiency controlling costs and maintaining a high lease fleet utilization while growing our owned and managed lease fleet our second quarter performance reflects the strength and breadth of our integrated manufacturing leasing and services business model from our ability to maintain an industryleading backlog and originate large leasing transactions for new railcars to our relationships with institutional investors and customers seeking railcar maintenance services ill now turn it over to james for his remarks james e perry  trinity industries inc thank you steve and good morning everyone yesterday we announced our results for the second quarter of  for the quarter the company reported revenues of  million and earnings per share of  compared to revenues of  billion and eps of  for the second quarter of  during the second quarter we repurchased over  million shares of our common stock in the open market for  million leaving  million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization we also announced an  increase in our quarterly dividend from  per share to  per share since  we have returned approximately  million to shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends during the second quarter we added railcars to our whollyowned lease fleet with a value of  million and invested  million in capital expenditures across our manufacturing businesses and at the corporate level as bill mentioned we recently made two complementary acquisitions in our construction products group including a small lightweight aggregates business in the second quarter and a trench shoring business early in the third quarter during the second quarter we sold a portfolio of  million of leased railcars through our railcar investment vehicle platform as steve indicated we continue to expect total sales of leased railcars of between  million and  million during  in may we issued approximately  million of nonrecourse secured bank term notes in our leasing company we were pleased to achieve an attractive interest rate and terms for this debt this will support the higher level of railcar leasing capex in  than our prior guidance due to the increased railcar delivery guidance our balance sheet remains very strong at the end of the second quarter our cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities totaled  million more than offsetting the recourse debt on our balance sheet combined with our available credit facilities our available committed liquidity position was approximately  billion at the end of the quarter consolidated sea expenses for the second quarter increased yearoveryear about  for a number of reasons led by bad debt expense primarily related to one customer in our energy equipment group and increased insurance and litigationrelated cost these increases were partially offset by a reduction in compensation expenses were also investing in our businesses through research and development as well as upgrading infrastructure across the company were implementing a number of necessary technology upgrades that will position us well when production volumes increase we found in past cycles that downturns are a good time in our businesses to implement these upgrades these investments add to our sea but we believe better prepare us for longterm growth in our press release yesterday we provided updated fullyear  earnings guidance of  to  compared to our prior guidance of  to  the increase to guidance reflects second quarter results and better visibility that we now have with respect to the remaining six months of the year in  we continue to anticipate total company revenues excluding sales of leased railcars of approximately  billion as steve mentioned we increased our railcar delivery guidance and now expect our rail group to deliver approximately  railcars in  the majority of the increase in our delivery guidance reflects railcars that are expected to be delivered through our leasing company we now expect rail group revenues of approximately  billion during  with an operating margin of  an improvement from our previous guidance of  in  at the consolidated company level we now expect to eliminate  million of the rail groups revenues due to sales to our leasing company and to defer  million of operating profit from these sales both of these figures are higher than previously projected due to the volume and mix of railcars that we now anticipate adding to our lease fleet as a reminder these revenue eliminations and profit deferrals result in the accounting treatment of sales from our railcar manufacturing company to our railcar leasing company we anticipate energy equipment group revenues of  million with an operating margin of  for the full year as bill mentioned we expect deliveries in our wind towers business to be lower in the fourth quarter as customer make planned reductions in yearend inventories as a result we expect the groups fourth quarter revenues and operating margin to step down relative to the annual pace we expect revenues of  million for our construction products group down slightly from our prior forecast but maintain expectations of an operating margin of  in  for the inland barge group we now expect revenues of  million and an operating margin of  in  both down yearoveryear due to weak market conditions we have previously guided to revenues of  million and a margin of  during  for this business the new guidance implies an operating loss in this group for the back half of the year we now anticipate our leasing group to record  leasing and management revenues of  million with an operating profit of  million both an improvement from the guidance we provided in april these figures exclude sales of leased railcars our fullyear eps guidance includes the following corporatelevel assumptions corporate expenses of between  million and  million a reduction of  per share due to the twoclass method of accounting compared to calculating trinitys eps directly from the face of the income statement a reduction of  per share due to our noncontrolling interest in the partiallyowned lease fleet dilution from the convertible notes of  per share based on the current stock price and a tax rate of approximately  which includes the  tax rate during the first quarter and the  higherthannormal tax rate in the second quarter due to the adoption of a new accounting standard we expect the backhalf  tax rate of approximately  in terms of investment we expect manufacturing and corporate capital expenditures in the range of  million to  million in  we anticipate adding approximately  million of leased railcars to our whollyowned fleet which includes new additions as well as a modest level of secondary market purchases the net investment in our whollyowned lease fleet after netting the proceeds from expected sales of leased railcars and deferred profit from new additions is expected to be between  million and  million as we indicated in our press release yesterday actual results in  may differ from present expectations and could be impacted by a number of factors including among others the risk factors and forwardlooking statements disclosed in our k we remain focused on longterm value creation and we continue to maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation our activity over the last few months including share repurchases and a dividend increase bolton acquisitions and lease fleet investment are good examples of our balanced approach our operator will now prepare us for the questionandanswer session questionandanswer session operator and well take our first question from prashant rao with citigroup please go ahead your line is open prashant rao  citigroup global markets inc good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my questions i wanted to start just asking about the uptick in orders in the rail group i mean you talked about the majority of those being sales to the leasing business and presumably a good portion of those are sand cars in the archived data we also saw an uptick in tank car orders too so i just wanted to get a sense of what youre seeing in terms of the order book build and the backlog is that mostly on hoppers and is there any tank increase coming in and if so whats spiking that d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc yeah prashant this is steve menzies thank you for the question again the orders that we saw both throughout the industry as well as for trinity were fairly broadbased encompassing a number of different markets of course when you talk about covered hoppers as you specifically mentioned theres many different types of covered hoppers serving a number of different markets certainly the frac sand market as well as plastic pallets resins the various grain markets so even within covered hoppers theres a fair amount of diversification the other thing i would point out is that we saw a predominance of leasing orders during the quarter certainly as evidenced by what trinityrail took in but also throughout the industry we saw very strong leasing presence in the order totals prashant rao  citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful and maybe turning to the leasing group youre adding to that fleet you talked about a car secondary market transaction just wondering if you can give a little bit more color about that and then generally what youre seeing in the secondary market any color in terms of evaluation or your appetite as we look to the back half of turning to the secondary market if were getting any signs that theres some more attractive maybe targets out there d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc yeah prashant steve again first of all i think we said we made a  million sale during the quarter and we continue and thats through our railcar investment vehicle platform where we work very closely with some designated institutional investors who we continue to sell railcars to and where we manage those railcars and maintain the commercial relationships we continue to see interest in participating in our railcar investment vehicle platform by institutional investors but also the secondary market seems to be very active as well we acquired a small group of cars in the secondary market and we are out looking for other acquisition opportunities but the pricing on secondary market transactions is very competitive prashant rao  citigroup global markets inc okay thats really helpful and then just one last question from me and then ill turn it over the acquisition that you made in the lightweight aggregates business can you give us a sense of what geographies that opens you up to in terms of footprint and maybe some thoughts on if theres more opportunity in terms of growth there given some of the tailwinds were seeing or in the fundamentals william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc yeah sure this is bill so the acquisition in lightweights was in kentucky and it opened the markets for us there we previously had an operation in alabama and louisiana as well as texas colorado and california so it gives us nice broad reach across the united states and was really complementary to the business timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc hey bill why dont you give them a little bit of background on the lightweight business william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc yeah sure so the lightweight business is really one of two businesses within the construction aggregates business so ill start with the lightweight since were there but the lightweight business trinity has a national presence and its really a competency of mining shale and clay and running shale and clay through a rotary kiln to produce an aggregate that is in essence a substitute for natural aggregates and its key trait is that its lightweight in nature and therefore can be used for certain applications and the applications can range from highrise buildings to block to horticulturaltype work some sort of masonry as well so really a specialty material that is a valueadd product a little more production competency than our base business but something that weve gotten very good at and have a really nice scale across the united states the second piece of the aggregates business is what we would call the natural aggregates and thats our sand and stone and gravel business where were simply mining those products from the earth cleaning and segregating the products and selling them to a base of customers and theyre very prominently used in residential commercial and industrial markets and were very focused there in the southwestern part of the united states and over really  years weve been in business its provided very nice returns for us a diversification of earnings and its been a relatively lowrisk building business one of the great things about it is when you identify the reserves and then harness the intrinsic value of the reserves youre really left managing a little bit of real estate component that weve done quite well with on the backend prashant rao  citigroup global markets inc okay thats very helpful color i appreciate it gentlemen ill turn it over thank you operator well take our next question from matt elkott with cowen please go ahead your line is open matt elkott  cowen  co llc good morning thank you for taking my question so you guys had the highest number of orders in two years it looks like this quarter significant increase from the first quarter meanwhile over the past couple of years youve been kind of adjusting operating resources to match a very anemic environment so i was just wondering how much manufacturing capacity you have to reactivate and how much cost is involved to kind of accommodate hopefully the new environment thats much better than weve seen over the past couple of years it looks like from your margin guidance there seems to be pretty good incremental leverage just wanted to kind of get some more color on that d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc yeah sure matt this is steve thank you for the question yeah what weve learned over time is really how to optimize the flexibility of our production footprint and to be able to ramp up as demand requires and were starting to see a little bit of that now that were positioning ourselves for at the same time when we see weaker conditions to be able to reduce our footprint within our footprint we have the ability to increase production rates on our production lines at a certain plant a lot of that is really laborrelated and our teams have done really well in being able to hire train and retain skilled labor so it isnt necessarily about production capacity of plants as much it is generating production line efficiencies and managing our labor very effectively matt elkott  cowen  co llc got it and any idea on what percentage of these orders will be built for – are for  deliveries versus  or beyond d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc sure again the guidance that we provided is that weve increased our deliveries for  to  and thats a function of not only new orders that weve taken but also pulling forward some railcars that we had previously deferred into  matt elkott  cowen  co llc got it and the backlog asp decline even though youve grown it for the first time in two years as well the value remained the same indicating a lower asp i would imagine most of that asp decline is attributable to new orders versus the profile of deliveries d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc well you have a little combination of both you have both the new orders as well as the mix of railcars that we pulled forward so that does have an impact on our asp matt elkott  cowen  co llc got it and just one final quick question you mentioned that the inquiry activity in the third quarter has been consistent with q which is very encouraging i was just wondering how many orders – i dont know if youre able to quantify it but if youve gotten any orders in the third quarter so far d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc well we have received orders in the quarter but we dont comment about our third quarters until the quarter is completed matt elkott  cowen  co llc great thank you very much operator well take our next question from brian colley with stephens please go ahead your line is open brian colley  stephens inc hey good morning guys and congratulations on the quarter timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc thank you brian colley  stephens inc so would you guys be willing to disclose the revenue from the two bolton acquisitions you made in the quarter just curious what that is and then looking ahead wondering if we should expect maybe some larger acquisitions in the future what are you guys seeing out in the ma market james e perry  trinity industries inc this is james ill start brian thanks for your question today we dont at this time have an estimate that were putting out there for the revenues the lightweight acquisition business was very strategic for us a rather small acquisition but very nice the shoring acquisition as bill said it was rather similar in size to the one we did a few years ago so thats going to be a nice addition to the construction products group portfolio that business has continued to perform well and gave us good returns but from a pipeline perspective these acquisitions have just recently happened and so were still assessing how that flows through especially this year but then well be able to provide more insight as we get into  later this year or early next year brian colley  stephens inc okay thats helpful and then just thinking about the lease rate environment it seems like theyve been pretty stable sequentially yeartodate outside of the pickup weve seen in frac sand have trends been pretty similar in terms of new railcar prices for the industry just curious to see if weve seen any stabilization on that front as well d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc yeah brian its steve well first of all when youre talking about a new railcar and youre leasing a new railcar you project what you think that railcar will earn not only over its original lease term but over a pretty good bit of its life and the assumption is that it meets our hurdle rate that you have for investment so we do think that the new railcars that are being produced and that were putting on a lease fleet do have attractive longterm returns in our business lease rates on new railcars have moved with new railcar prices which are obviously down over the last  months or so but it seems to move in parallel and then you have the returns that you get with the investment so brian colley  stephens inc okay thats helpful i appreciate the time today timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc thank you brian operator and well take our next question from bascome majors with susquehanna please go ahead your line is open bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp yeah thanks for taking my question here so over the last lets call it a yearandahalf two years you guys have been very forward about the challenges that youre seeing in your end markets and it felt like the tone changed a bit more constructively this quarter especially in light of your typical conservatism there i mean youre talking about seeing some kind of earlycycle activity in some of your markets particularly rail you started buying stock for the first time in over a year raised the dividend did some tuckin acquisitions and so im just trying to kind of unpack that not really at the segment level but maybe at the customer and the broader highlevel endmarkets where are you seeing signs of life in your industrial endmarkets and what would you call more steady or maybe even weakening in over the next lets call it  to  months timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc steve why dont you take that first part and bill you can add color on the back side d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc yeah bascome thanks i think theres general optimism with our customers in conversations that we have but a lot of that optimism is based upon some expected changes in tax law and regulatory reform that were only seeing the beginnings of or prospectively the beginnings of so while there is optimism before customers really start to make commitments through acquiring or leasing capital equipment i think theyre looking for some more evidence that the trends are going to continue for a stronger and improved environment i will tell you that some of the equipment that has been ordered in the rail sector are for projects that are already under investments and are part of those facilities or operations being build out this is particularly true in the downstream petrochemical sector and in the specialty chemical sector where we see tank cars and large covered hopper cars are produced and i think as tim mentioned we also see customers see this time as opportunistic if they have large strategic purchases to make and some of the orders that we did see during the quarter were for replacement of older equipment for upgrading of equipment to be more competitive in the marketplace so i think customers are looking at their capital opportunities they are investing its slow in coming never as quick as we would like but i think generally the arrow points a little bit upwards as opposed to another direction bill you want to add on to that william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc yeah i would say from our perspective the cpg area or construction business and energy business really reflect the broad base of infrastructure spend and when we look at infrastructure spend drivers throughout the united states and north america they point fairly strong at both the state level and the federal level and so while there is good funding and there is good growth there there is a lot of conversation about more funding and more growth at a much higher level and so we have several businesses certainly the aggregates business the highway business the utility business that are all benefiting from a spend in americas infrastructure bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp i appreciate the comprehensive answer guys and maybe if i could kind of take it even higher level to tim here and does it feel like  as you kind of unpack that is the bottom for your multiindustry portfolio here is it still early or too early to make that call timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc i think its too early to make that call as ive said theres unique mixture that weve seen ever since the election occurring with our end markets of our customers being optimistic but also a little bit uncertain and so in this environment our flexibility plays a really key role and our ability to be able to ramp up quickly and step out in front of our customers and say we can take the big orders if you have the demand and the need and so thats what inspires me and it really thrills me as well to see what happened in our rail business because we did have some big customers that pursued us and we were able to respond and so if that continues then you end up getting some really positive momentum that we would then declare that we have left the bottom and were moving up in a more upward direction bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you tim i appreciate that just one last one for me on the rail business weve seen the stored railcars numbers at least how the aar defines them sequentially rise fairly modestly but pretty much in the rail and thats the first time thats happened really in over a year im just curious do you guys have any insight into whats driving that either from a customer level or kind of what you heard in your business and with that ill give it back to the next guy d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc sure bascome steve again i guess the devils in those details when you look at the overall number of idle railcars when you start to delve a little further into the different types of railcars each one of them tells a little bit different story about the various markets but again i think right now what weve seen in the idle fleet is encouraging when we look at the other trends in the railcar market fundamentals operator and well take our next question from gordon johnson with axiom please go ahead your line is open gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc hey guys thanks for taking the question timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc good morning gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc just as a point of clarification did you guys say the new orders this quarter were  to the lease group d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc approximately yes gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay so i guess one question we had is okay assuming – looking at your backlog your backlog in terms of dollars looks to be flat but clearly units were up so just working out the math it seems like maybe the asp was down on that backlog or those new orders so is the way to think about this the new orders that the lease group purchased given the asp is down significantly the lease rates on those cars will be worse than i guess what weve seen previously james e perry  trinity industries inc gordon this is james ill answer that at a high level thats probably reading a little too deep into were not implying that the biggest reason you see changes when you have the big order quarters like we just did part of it is youre working off the deliveries you made at certain levels of pricing and mix and then youre taking orders for cars at a different level of pricing a lot of that is related to the mix of the car so as the car types themselves change certainly from tank to freight and different car types the mix alone can do that q kind of reflected that type of piece as well so when you see q the backlog number ending up in the same place rounding up to that  billion or so is a factor of pricing mix volume deliveries and the new orders i wouldnt imply that all the way down to the lease rate level gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay and then just applying some math here assuming a  asp what went in  does that imply that new orders are at a roughly  asp james e perry  trinity industries inc i think your math is probably in the ballpark youll see a little more of that in the q but your math is roughly right but again thats mix as much as anything in the car types that we delivered versus the car types we took in gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay and then just lastly looking at i guess the  of new orders to the lease group the last time we saw that type of percentage to the lease group was in  and i guess  to  your operating cash flow fell from  million to  million so your operating cash flow was  billion last year should we expect a decline in your operating cash flow as you sell more cars to your lease group james e perry  trinity industries inc yeah gordon this is james not necessarily theres a lot of moving parts when you look at  and  versus where we are now a lot of the operating cash flow the first part of course is net income and you have that guidance changes to working capital which could ramp up as our delivery expectations ramp up as well the operating cash flow line wont be affected by that necessarily as you get down into the investing and financing lines the capex to leasing will show up in the way we invest our capital and then whether we finance those cars or not we did a financing in q to kind of prefund some of those but how much we do financing will determine the ultimate cash flow depends on which line you stop at in the cash flow statement gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay thanks a lot guys and congrats on the good orders timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc thank you gordon james e perry  trinity industries inc thanks operator well take our next question from allison poliniak with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc hi guys good morning steve can i just confirm did you say construction products revenue is going to be  million versus the  million that you guys laid before timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc  million versus the  million allison allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc okay so can you just explain it sounds like you guys are pretty positive on the aggregates and the infrastructure side of the business what changed there thats driving that revenue to come down a little bit timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc bill william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc yeah allison this is bill part of the decline has been in the highway products side of the business and as we look at the highway products side of the business we have stepped back and kind of strategically reduced the portfolio offering a little bit and so a bit of that is intentional were focused obviously on bottomline operating profit the dollars and the margin and we may sacrifice a little bit of revenue to get there allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc thats great and then on the trench shoring business not specifics but maybe help us try to frame it in our mind in terms of growth rate of that area right now and just maybe margins relative to your current segment margins are they better will we get a better mix with this kind of business going forward william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc yeah i would say the margins are relatively consistent with the margins of the segment overall its got really good market dynamics going forward its highly related to infrastructure that we talked about earlier and so as these projects go off to fix a lot of the waterlines that need to fixed and put the pipelines in that need to be there it does well it is also a seasonal business so it will have a little seasonal tail in the winter months very similar to the construction business allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc got it and then just the wind stepping down in q is that just the nature of the projectrelated business or is there something more to read into that william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc no its just the nature of the business weve had this for several quarters youll see the first quarter kind of popup as they take the inventory back but essentially theyve all got a mandate to reduce their inventory right at the yearend and so rather than completely shutting down production and then coming back and being behind we try to run a fairly steady projection and we just dont take that revenue until its delivered in the first quarter allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc perfect and then just one last one on the operating revenue increase for the leasing business is that just the incremental adds to the new leased cars in the back half of the year new deliveries william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc more than anything else allison allison a poliniakcusic  wells fargo securities llc perfect thank you william a mcwhirter  trinity industries inc thank you operator and well take our next question from matt brooklier with buckingham research please go ahead your line is open matthew s brooklier  the buckingham research group hey thanks and good morning steve did you talk to the raised delivery guidance for  how much of that is a pullforward of some of the cars that were deferred into  and  versus how much of that is a result of the increased orders that you took in q d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc matt the increase in our production projections from our last guidance are split about evenly between cars that were pulled forward from  as well as incremental orders matthew s brooklier  the buckingham research group okay and on the pullforward on the cars that were deferred we should assume majority of those are the small cube hoppers for the sand market d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc yes matthew s brooklier  the buckingham research group okay d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc theres also a few other orders but predominantly those would be correct matthew s brooklier  the buckingham research group okay thats helpful and then how should we think about the cadence of deliveries as we work through the year relative to the total number of cars a little over  that you shipped in second quarter is it kind of a ratable increase throughout the remaining two quarters of  is there a bigger ramp in the back half of the year a little color there would be helpful d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc yeah it will ramp up throughout the second half of the year our third quarter will have a higher production level than the second quarter and the fourth quarter will likely be higher yet matthew s brooklier  the buckingham research group okay and then your commentary regarding i think just the industry book in general and the increase in terms of the orders it sounded like there was a greater percentage of lessors who were placing orders in q is that just a function of the cycle and early in the recovery stages typically you see lessors step up and try to position themselves into potentially improving marketplace or improving railcar fundamentals or is there something else going on that i guess potentially changed the mix of whos buying cars in q d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc yes well thanks there were certainly some orders placed by lessors during the quarter but there were also a number of orders that were placed by industrial shippers who are looking to lease the equipment and not acquire the equipment and when i refer to those as the leasing orders thats really what im referring to and a number of those orders at least from our perspective were very good counterparties in longterm leases and we found those opportunities to be very attractive cleary the trend over time matt has been that were seeing more and more leasing activity the growth of leasing not only by industrial shippers but also by class i railroads continues to grow and thats certainly one of the longterm fundamental reasons why we continue to invest in our leasing capabilities to strengthen our business platform matthew s brooklier  the buckingham research group okay thats very helpful and then just my last question the tank car i think you indicated you did take some tank car orders in the quarter are you able to elaborate on the types of cars are those flammable service tanks and potentially related to the regulation mandate deadlines that we have for replacement were they nonflammable cars im just trying to get a sense for maybe the uptick in terms of industry tank orders whats driving that d stephen menzies  trinity industries inc without getting into deep detail on the orders themselves i think as ive said we see demand continue to have some pace to it associated with the downstream chemical and petrochemical sector specialty chemicals and i would generally categorize our tank car orders from those industry sectors matt elkott  cowen  co llc okay very helpful as always appreciate the time timothy r wallace  trinity industries inc thank you matt operator
