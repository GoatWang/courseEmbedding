copy protection ripguardedit macrovision introduced its ripguard technology in february  it was designed to prevent or reduce digital dvd copying by altering the format of the dvd content to disrupt the ripping software although the technology could be circumvented by several current dvd rippers such as anydvd or dvdfab macrovision claimed that  of casual users lack the knowledge andor determination to be able to copy a dvd with ripguard technology analog copy protection acpedit analog video formats convey video signals as a series of lines most of these lines are used for constructing the visible image and are shown on the screen but several more lines exist which do not convey visual information known as the vertical blanking interval vbi these extra lines historically served no purpose other than to contain the vertical synchronizing pulses but in more modern implementations they are used to carry or convey different things in different countries for example closed captioning macrovision pulses in an otherwise unused video line here they are large forcing a vcrs auto contrast circuit to make the picture darker a couple of seconds later the pulses have reduced in amplitude forcing a vcrs auto contrast circuit to make the picture lighter a couple of seconds later still the pulses return to their original amplitude darkening the picture once more macrovisions legacy analog copy protection acp works by implanting a series of excessive voltage pulses within the offscreen vbi lines of video these pulses were included physically within preexisting recordings on vhs and betamax and were generated upon playback by a chip in dvd players and digital cable or satellite boxes a dvd recorder receiving an analog signal featuring these pulses would detect them and display a message saying that the source is copyprotected followed by aborting the recording vcrs in turn react to these excessive voltage pulses by compensating with their automatic gain control circuitry causing the recorded picture to wildly change brightness rendering it annoying to watch the system was only effective on vcrs made at around the mids and later a later form of macrovisions analog copy protection called level ii acp introduced multiple degree phase inversions to the analog signals colorburst also known as colorstriping this technology caused numerous offcolor bands to appear within the picture another form of analog copy protection known as cgmsa is added by dvd players and digital cablesatellite boxes while not invented by macrovision the companys products implemented it cgmsa consists of a flag within the vertical blanking interval essentially data like closed captioning which digital recording devices search for if present it refused to record the signal just as with the earlier acp technology unlike digital recording equipment however analog vcrs do not respond to cgmsa encoded video and would record it successfully if acp is not also presentcitation needed historically the original macrovision technology was considered a nuisance to some specialist users because it could interfere with other electronic equipment for example if one were to run a video signal through a vcr before the television some vcrs will output a ruined signal regardless of whether it is recording this also occurs in some tvvcr combo sets apart from this many dvd recorders mistake the mechanical instability of worn videotapes for macrovision signals and so refuse to make what would be perfectly legal dvd dubs of peoples old home movies and the like this widespread problem is another factor contributing to the demand for devices that defeat macrovision the signal has also been known to confuse home theater line doublers devices for improving the quality of video for large projection tvs and some highend television comb filters in addition macrovision confuses many upconverters devices that convert a video signal to a higher resolution causing them to shut down and refuse to play macrovision contentcitation needed there are also devices called stabilizers video stabilizers or enhancers available that filter out the macrovision spikes and thereby defeat the system the principle of their function lies in detecting the vertical synchronization signal and forcing the lines occurring during the vbi to black level removing the agcconfusing pulses they can be easily built by hobbyists as nothing more than a cheap microcontroller together with an analog multiplexer and a little other circuitry is needed individuals less experienced with such things can purchase video stabilizers discs made with dvd copying programs such as dvd shrink automatically disable any macrovision copy protection the ease with which macrovision and other copy protection measures can be defeated has prompted a steadily growing number of dvd releases that do not have copy protection of any kind content scramble system css or macrovision united states fair use law as interpreted in the decision over betamax sony corp v universal city studios dictates that consumers are fully within their legal rights to copy videos they own however the legality has changed somewhat with the controversial digital millennium copyright act after april   no vcr may be manufactured or imported without automatic gain control circuitry which renders vcrs vulnerable to macrovision this is contained in title  section k of the digital millennium copyright act however there are a number of mostly older vcr models on the market that are not affected by macrovision on october   the sale purchase or manufacture of any device that has no commercial purpose other than disabling macrovision copy protection was made illegal under section a of the same controversial act in june  macrovision sent a cease and desist letter to lightning uk the maker of dvd decrypter a program that allows users to back up their dvds by bypassing css and macrovision they later acquired the rights to this software in june  macrovision sued sima products under section  of the dmca claiming that simas video processors provided a way to circumvent

to create plans for onair promoscitation needed legacy productsedit the company historically developed technologies and products that helped protect content from being pirated its two core legacy products were called ripguard and acp analog copy protection ripguardedit macrovision introduced its ripguard technology in february  it was designed to prevent or reduce digital dvd copying by altering the format of the dvd content to disrupt the ripping software although the technology could be circumvented by several current dvd rippers such as anydvd or dvdfab macrovision claimed that  of casual users lack the knowledge andor determination to be able to copy a dvd with ripguard technology analog copy protection acpedit analog video formats convey video signals as a series of lines most of these lines are used for constructing the visible image and are shown on the screen but several more lines exist which do not convey visual information known as the vertical blanking interval vbi these extra lines historically served no purpose other than to contain the vertical synchronizing pulses but in more modern implementations they are used to carry or convey different things in different countries for example closed captioning macrovision pulses in an otherwise unused video line here they are large forcing a vcrs auto contrast circuit to make the picture darker a couple of seconds later the pulses have reduced in amplitude forcing a vcrs auto contrast circuit to make the picture lighter a couple of seconds later still the pulses return to their original amplitude darkening the picture once more macrovisions legacy analog copy protection acp works by implanting a series of excessive voltage pulses within the offscreen vbi lines of video these pulses were included physically within preexisting recordings on vhs and betamax and were generated upon playback by a chip in dvd players and digital cable or satellite boxes a dvd recorder receiving an analog signal featuring these pulses would detect them and display a message saying that the source is copyprotected followed by aborting the recording vcrs in turn react to these excessive voltage pulses by compensating with their automatic gain control circuitry causing the recorded picture to wildly change brightness rendering it annoying to watch the system was only effective on vcrs made at around the mids and later a later form of macrovisions analog copy protection called level ii acp introduced multiple degree phase inversions to the analog signals colorburst also known as colorstriping this technology caused numerous offcolor bands to appear within the picture another form of analog copy protection known as cgmsa is added by dvd players and digital cablesatellite boxes while not invented by macrovision the companys products implemented it cgmsa consists of a flag within the vertical blanking interval essentially data like closed captioning which digital recording devices search for if present it refused to record the signal just as with the earlier acp technology unlike digital recording equipment however analog vcrs do not respond to cgmsa encoded video and would record it successfully if acp is not also presentcitation needed historically the original macrovision technology was considered a nuisance to some specialist users because it could interfere with other electronic equipment for example if one were to run a video signal through a vcr before the television some vcrs will output a ruined signal regardless of whether it is recording this also occurs in some tvvcr combo sets apart from this many dvd recorders mistake the mechanical instability of worn videotapes for macrovision signals and so refuse to make what would be perfectly legal dvd dubs of peoples old home movies and the like this widespread problem is another factor contributing to the demand for devices that defeat macrovision the signal has also been known to confuse home theater line doublers devices for improving the quality of video for large projection tvs and some highend television comb filters in addition macrovision confuses many upconverters devices that convert a video signal to a higher resolution causing them to shut down and refuse to play macrovision contentcitation needed there are also devices called stabilizers video stabilizers or enhancers available that filter out the macrovision spikes and thereby defeat the system the principle of their function lies in detecting the vertical synchronization signal and forcing the lines occurring during the vbi to black level removing the agcconfusing pulses they can be easily built by hobbyists as nothing more than a cheap microcontroller together with an analog multiplexer and a little other circuitry is needed individuals less experienced with such things can purchase video stabilizers discs made with dvd copying programs such as dvd shrink automatically disable any macrovision copy protection the ease with which macrovision and other copy protection measures can be defeated has prompted a steadily growing number of dvd releases that do not have copy protection of any kind content scramble system css or macrovision united states fair use law as interpreted in the decision over betamax sony corp v universal city studios dictates that consumers are fully within their legal rights to copy videos they own however the legality has changed somewhat with the controversial digital millennium copyright act after april   no vcr may be manufactured or imported without automatic gain control circuitry which renders vcrs vulnerable to macrovision this is contained in title  section k of the digital millennium copyright act however there are a number of mostly older vcr models on the market that are not affected by macrovision on october   the sale purchase or manufacture of any device that has no commercial purpose other than disabling macrovision copy protection was made illegal under section a of the same controversial act in june  macrovision sent a cease and desist letter to lightning uk the maker of dvd decrypter a program that allows users to back up their dvds by bypassing css and macrovision they later acquired the rights to this software in june  macrovision sued sima products under section  of the dmca claiming that simas video processors provided a way to circumvent macrovisions analog copy protection sima received an injunction barring the sale of this device but the parties ultimately settled without a judgment on the legal issues as macrovisionedit in

optimizer uses past viewing data to enable cable and broadcast networks to create plans for onair promoscitation needed legacy productsedit the company historically developed technologies and products that helped protect content from being pirated its two core legacy products were called ripguard and acp analog copy protection ripguardedit macrovision introduced its ripguard technology in february  it was designed to prevent or reduce digital dvd copying by altering the format of the dvd content to disrupt the ripping software although the technology could be circumvented by several current dvd rippers such as anydvd or dvdfab macrovision claimed that  of casual users lack the knowledge andor determination to be able to copy a dvd with ripguard technology analog copy protection acpedit analog video formats convey video signals as a series of lines most of these lines are used for constructing the visible image and are shown on the screen but several more lines exist which do not convey visual information known as the vertical blanking interval vbi these extra lines historically served no purpose other than to contain the vertical synchronizing pulses but in more modern implementations they are used to carry or convey different things in different countries for example closed captioning macrovision pulses in an otherwise unused video line here they are large forcing a vcrs auto contrast circuit to make the picture darker a couple of seconds later the pulses have reduced in amplitude forcing a vcrs auto contrast circuit to make the picture lighter a couple of seconds later still the pulses return to their original amplitude darkening the picture once more macrovisions legacy analog copy protection acp works by implanting a series of excessive voltage pulses within the offscreen vbi lines of video these pulses were included physically within preexisting recordings on vhs and betamax and were generated upon playback by a chip in dvd players and digital cable or satellite boxes a dvd recorder receiving an analog signal featuring these pulses would detect them and display a message saying that the source is copyprotected followed by aborting the recording vcrs in turn react to these excessive voltage pulses by compensating with their automatic gain control circuitry causing the recorded picture to wildly change brightness rendering it annoying to watch the system was only effective on vcrs made at around the mids and later a later form of macrovisions analog copy protection called level ii acp introduced multiple degree phase inversions to the analog signals colorburst also known as colorstriping this technology caused numerous offcolor bands to appear within the picture another form of analog copy protection known as cgmsa is added by dvd players and digital cablesatellite boxes while not invented by macrovision the companys products implemented it cgmsa consists of a flag within the vertical blanking interval essentially data like closed captioning which digital recording devices search for if present it refused to record the signal just as with the earlier acp technology unlike digital recording equipment however analog vcrs do not respond to cgmsa encoded video and would record it successfully if acp is not also presentcitation needed historically the original macrovision technology was considered a nuisance to some specialist users because it could interfere with other electronic equipment for example if one were to run a video signal through a vcr before the television some vcrs will output a ruined signal regardless of whether it is recording this also occurs in some tvvcr combo sets apart from this many dvd recorders mistake the mechanical instability of worn videotapes for macrovision signals and so refuse to make what would be perfectly legal dvd dubs of peoples old home movies and the like this widespread problem is another factor contributing to the demand for devices that defeat macrovision the signal has also been known to confuse home theater line doublers devices for improving the quality of video for large projection tvs and some highend television comb filters in addition macrovision confuses many upconverters devices that convert a video signal to a higher resolution causing them to shut down and refuse to play macrovision contentcitation needed there are also devices called stabilizers video stabilizers or enhancers available that filter out the macrovision spikes and thereby defeat the system the principle of their function lies in detecting the vertical synchronization signal and forcing the lines occurring during the vbi to black level removing the agcconfusing pulses they can be easily built by hobbyists as nothing more than a cheap microcontroller together with an analog multiplexer and a little other circuitry is needed individuals less experienced with such things can purchase video stabilizers discs made with dvd copying programs such as dvd shrink automatically disable any macrovision copy protection the ease with which macrovision and other copy protection measures can be defeated has prompted a steadily growing number of dvd releases that do not have copy protection of any kind content scramble system css or macrovision united states fair use law as interpreted in the decision over betamax sony corp v universal city studios dictates that consumers are fully within their legal rights to copy videos they own however the legality has changed somewhat with the controversial digital millennium copyright act after april   no vcr may be manufactured or imported without automatic gain control circuitry which renders vcrs vulnerable to macrovision this is contained in title  section k of the digital millennium copyright act however there are a number of mostly older vcr models on the market that are not affected by macrovision on october   the sale purchase or manufacture of any device that has no commercial purpose other than disabling macrovision copy protection was made illegal under section a of the same controversial act in june  macrovision sent a cease and desist letter to lightning uk the maker of dvd decrypter a program that allows users to back up their dvds by bypassing css and macrovision they later acquired the rights to this software in june  macrovision sued sima products under section  of the dmca claiming that simas video processors provided a way to circumvent macrovisions analog copy protection sima received an injunction barring the sale of this device but the parties ultimately settled without a judgment on the legal issues as macrovisionedit in  macrovision acquired globetrotter creators of the flexlm which was subsequently renamed flexnet in  macrovision
