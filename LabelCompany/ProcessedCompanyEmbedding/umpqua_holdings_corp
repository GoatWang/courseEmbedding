portfolio and taxable investments as well as an increase in the cost of interestbearing liabilities residential mortgage banking revenue was  million for the three months ended march   as compared to

significant accounting policies are described in note  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in the form k filed with the sec on february   not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the secs definition allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the bank performs regular credit reviews of the loan and lease portfolio to determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards when loans and leases are originated they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process the banks risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from  to  where a higher rating represents higher risk the  risk rating categories are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan and lease losses the bank has a management allowance for loan and lease losses alll committee which is responsible for among other things regularly reviewing the alll methodology including loss factors and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the alll committee reviews and approves loans and leases recommended for impaired status the alll committee also approves removing loans and leases from impaired status the banks audit and compliance committee provides board oversight of the alll process and reviews and approves the alll methodology on a quarterly basis each risk rating is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses provided for that group of loans and leases with similar risk rating credit loss factors may vary by region based on managements belief that there may ultimately be different credit loss rates experienced in each region regular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired potentially impaired loans are referred to the alll committee which reviews and approves designated loans as impaired a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract including scheduled interest payments when we identify a loan as impaired we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral in these cases we use the current fair value of the collateral less selling costs instead of discounted cash flows if we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan we either recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses or chargeoff the impaired balance on collateral dependent loans if it is determined that such amount represents a confirmed loss the combination of the risk ratingbased allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan and lease losses the bank may also maintain an unallocated allowance amount to provide for other credit losses inherent in a loan and lease portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the credit loss factors this unallocated amount generally comprises less than  of the allowance but may be maintained at higher levels during times of economic conditions characterized by falling real estate values the unallocated amount is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses the results of credit reviews and overall economic trends as of march   there was no unallocated allowance amount the ruc is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds such as with a letter or line of credit the adequacy of the alll and ruc are monitored on a regular basis and are based on managements evaluation of numerous factors these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio the trend in the loan portfolios risk ratings current economic conditions loan concentrations loan growth rates pastdue and nonperforming trends evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans historical chargeoff and recovery experience and other pertinent information management believes that the alll was adequate as of march   there is however no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the alll and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in addition bank regulatory authorities as part of their periodic examination of the bank may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate as a result a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses table of contents acquired loans acquired loans and leases are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date for purchased nonimpaired loans the difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income using the effective interest method over the remaining contractual period to maturity residential mortgage servicing rights msr the company determines its classes of servicing assets based on the asset type being serviced along with the methods used to manage the risk inherent in the servicing assets which includes the market inputs used to value the servicing assets the company measures its residential mortgage servicing assets at fair value and reports changes in fair value through earnings fair value adjustments encompass marketdriven valuation changes and the runoff in value that occurs from the passage of time which are separately reported under the fair value method the msr is carried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in earnings under the caption residential mortgage banking revenue in the period in which the change occurs retained mortgage servicing rights are measured at fair value as of the date of the related loan sale we use quoted market prices when available subsequent fair value measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model in order to determine the fair value of the msr the present value of expected net future cash flows is estimated assumptions used include market discount rates anticipated prepayment speeds delinquency and foreclosure rates and ancillary fee income net of servicing costs this model is periodically validated by an independent external model validation group the model assumptions and the msr fair value estimates are also compared to observable trades of similar portfolios as well as to msr broker valuations and industry surveys as available valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of december  additionally goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists the impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include among others competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition changes in revenue growth trends cost structures technology changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions there can be no assurance that changes in circumstances estimates or assumptions may result in additional impairment of all or some portion of goodwill or other intangible assets the company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis of the community banking reporting segment as of december   the company assessed qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicated that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired and determined no factors indicated an impairment table of contents stockbased compensation we recognize expense in the income statement for the grantdate fair value of restricted shares and stock options as equitybased forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period the requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions the fair value of the restricted shares is based on the companys share price on the grant date management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the pricing model and ultimately the expense that will be recognized over the expected service period related to each option fair value a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability is utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  which creates topic  and supersedes topic  revenue recognition in august  fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  which postponed the effective date of  multiple asus and interpretative guidance have been issued in connection with asu  the core principle of topic  is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in general the new guidance requires companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance including identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation the standard is effective for public entities for interim and annual periods beginning after december   early adoption is not permitted for financial reporting purposes the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application the company has begun their process to implement this new standard the company has started by reviewing all revenue sources to determine the sources that are in scope for this guidance as a bank key revenue sources such as interest income have been identified as out of scope of this new guidance the company has not yet determined the financial statement impact this guidance will have in january  the fasb issued asu no  financial instruments  overall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities the new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments this asu requires equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income in addition the amendment requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset ie securities or loans and receivables on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements this asu also eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet the amendment also requires a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument specific credit risk also referred to as own credit when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments asu no  is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for certain provisions the company is currently evaluating the impact of this asu on the companys consolidated financial statements table of contents in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases topic  the amendments in this update require lessees among other things to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous authoritative guidance this update also introduces new disclosure requirements for leasing arrangements asu  is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the company has established a project team for the implementation of this new standard the team is currently working with a vendor to put a new leasing software in place that will support the current leasing process as well as aid in the transition to the new leasing guidance although an estimate of the impact of the new leasing standard has not yet been determined the company expects a significant new lease asset and related lease liability on the balance sheet due to the number of leased properties the bank currently has that are accounted for under current operating lease guidance in june  the fasb issued asu no  financial instruments credit losses topic  measurement of credit losses on financial instruments the asu is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations the asu requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for certain financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts financial institutions and other organizations will now use forwardlooking information to better inform their credit loss estimates but will continue to use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances the asu requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organizations portfolio these    may   c  cybernet
