earnings call as a public company as most of you know our airline started about eight years ago with a handful of people who had a pretty radical idea and that was basically to create an airline that people love at that time air travel especially domestic air travel was a pretty dismal experience it was something to be tolerated rather than to look forward to and we came out to try to change that we also offered the industry a different business model streamlined low cost production model similar to what the low cost carrier were running at the time but a revenue model that was focused on higher yield in business travelers basically similar to how legacy carriers produced their revenue the business model allows us to offer a premium brand product in major business markets where guests have historically indiscernible of the legacy services but to do with the lower cost structure than the big legacy airlines were doing at the time and our revenue performance demonstrates our success as we continue to mature our markets and grow our loyal following of frequent fliers in  we achieved record profitability and significantly strengthened our balance sheet with the completion of one of the more successful airline ipos in history raising  million we eliminated  million in debt from our balance sheet and increased our liquidity by  million and we now have the right balance sheet for longterm growth and our balance sheet really has been a bit of anchor on the company up until this time and we’ve been freed from that anchor both our existing and new shareholders share a lot of confidence in the lowcost highamenity business model in  we recorded nongaap net income of  million excluding special items that peter will get into later full year nongaap net income increased by  million over  and it was the best year in our history rasm growth was  in  the second highest in the domestic industry and on highly competitive routes so if you look at our network we are in the most competitive routes in the country we have fared very well so you look at a long haul route like jfklax arguably the most competitive route in the country we were number two in rasm in that market and that’s a highly competitive market with i believe six competitors in it you look at a short haul market like laxsan francisco again a very dense market with lots of competitors we were also number two so weve proven we can go on the most competitive markets and have excellent rasm performance and this really demonstrates how our product resonates with our guest and the fact that travelers are willing to pay a small premium for our unique service in  we continue to grow and optimize our network and position the company for long term success with our expansion to our first midcontinent focused city at dallas love field and growth in the major business markets like new york la guardia and washington dc with new flights from la guardia and an expanded presence at dc where we previously had one beyond perimeter flight into san francisco these were due to the acquisition of key airport assets in  in conjunction with the us airways american settlement in new york were now serving all three major airports and weve expanded our rasm opportunities with four code share and  interline partnerships in  and this is becoming a more meaningful part of our revenue stream our new presence at love field allows us to bring out fair competition and to bring a different product to the market for business guests travelling from the airport that is the most convenient to downtown dallas were the only carrier at love field to offer three beautifully designed classes of service touch screen seat back entertainment wifi power outlets on every flight and on demand food and drink for every guest on every flight also today we announced that were launching new nonstop service between dallas love field and austin beginning on the th of april so here in a couple of months with five flights a day as you may know this is currently a monopoly route that has long suffered high fares were looking forward to stimulating the market by lowering fares as much as  to  and offering local travelers a high quality product and we think this is a market right for stimulation we think there is a lot of dry traffic that would rather fly with the right prices in particular walk up pricing the new route will complement our existing schedule and well also have pretty significant connecting opportunities from love field or over love field i should say that brings our total schedule to  departures daily from our two gates and i think critically two of the markets we served out of dca  out of love field are dca and la guardia both beyond perimeter to austin austin does have one nonstop flight from southwest but that makes those connecting markets and we think love field is going to be a good place to connect people this year we also continued to sweep the major travel awards with our consistent product and our top notch guest service including dna best domestic airline in both travel and leisure and condé nast annual surveys for the seventh consecutive year we also maintained our focus on operational integrity once again we were ranked number one airline in the airline quality report based on ontime performance customer complaints and baggage we continue to transform the traveler experience through our guest service and our innovative product we were the first airline earlier i should say ph in  to design its website with responsive design basically meaning you get the same web experience regardless of which device you were using in december  we completed our installation to gogos faster next generation agg  antennae we were the first airline of course back in  to have wifi in all of our airplanes this is basically going and replacing it with the highest quality wifi and the most reliable wifi and that is really our commitment to our guests that we will remain on the cutting edge when it comes to wifi we also launched a cobrand credit card program and continue to drive significant growth in our elevate frequent flyer program we grew by about  last year and we now have  million members just as importantly and i would say what is truly the core focus of our company is weve been able to do all of this while maintaining an efficient network in operation and maintaining one of the lowest casms in the industry and thats really what our focus has been fourth quarter casm increasing by about  due to our simple operating model of course none of this would have been possible and the company itself would not be possible without the hard work of our  team mates and their dedication to creating a greater airline and focusing on our customer before i hand it over to peter i do want to run through some of the highlights of the fourth quarter revenue performance and peter will get more into these numbers first of all fourth quarter prasm increased by  yearoveryear which is slightly higher than our prior estimates the load factor was up  points to  and yield declined by  point so that’s the math behind those numbers capacity was essentially flat and we did have a longer stage length about at  longer stage length total rasm increased  due to increased strength from our cobranded credit card that was implemented in  as well as some significant strength and i would say accelerating strength in other ancillary products most markets in the network performed well yearoveryear in the fourth quarter we do have a couple of pockets of weakness that we can address more fully if you would like one is in the new york transcon market it’s a highly competitive market and i think we all understand some of the disruption that’s going on with new products and more importantly new capacity that’s been introduced in the market and the other one is love field which is going through quite a disruptive transition with tremendous additional capacity in what is mature market if you take the total dallas metro flights ph and just lots of moving pieces when you look at the competitive dynamic there but again a market that we expect to be very robust but is going through what i would call a turbulent period right now as of now when we look forward to the first quarter  even with those comments i just made we do expect first quarter prasm to be relatively flat and i think we are going out with guidance of between negative one and positive one in terms of prasm yearoveryear in the first quarter at the same time we expect that we would continue to drive good results in  we got markets that remain to be matured and we have got some other longterm cost advantages that will kick in even further with that i am going to turn it over to our cfo peter hunt he is going to discuss both the full year  performance and our fourth quarter numbers in greater detail peter hunt thanks david and good morning everyone and before i run through all the details i did want to join david in thanking our team mates for another quarter of solid financial results and really just an exceptional  i will start with a run through the fourth quarter this morning virgin america reported fourth quarter net income excluding special items of  million which was a  increase in income from the fourth quarter of  improved rasm as david mentioned combined with relatively flat operating cost excluding special items drove a  increase in operating income to  million and our operating margin at  improved by  points yearoveryear as david mentioned total rasm increased  on a slight decline in capacity and on the cost side our total casm excluding special items increased  if you exclude fuel and profit sharing from our total casm that casm excluding fuel and profit sharing increased  yearoveryear and that’s primarily from increases in salaries and benefits to our teammates as well as higher airport related cost due to new airports in the network and also higher revenue related costs that go along with higher rasm our fuel cost excluding special items decreased  million yearoveryear and our average economic fuel cost per gallon during the quarter declined  to  this does include hedges that relate to the fourth quarter in those numbers it also includes fuel related taxes which is about  a gallon for us our taxes are little bit higher than most other airlines just simply due to the nature of our network and we estimate that we have about  million in losses associated with our fuel hedging program our program is designed to delay the impacts of changes in fuel price so when we have rapidly declining fuel costs as we did in the fourth quarter the impact of that will be delayed for us so we will receive the benefits within three to six months after drops in fuel price we estimate that for the quarter our price at spot prices would have been roughly  gallon to  a gallon versus the  that we recorded our net interest expense declined  million in the quarter which is just  that’s primarily due to the completion of our initial public offering and all the related improvements that that brought to our balance sheet and our fourth quarter fully diluted earnings per share excluding special items was a  and that’s based on the weighted average share count of  million this quarter is a little unusual because of the fact that we completed the initial public offering we have a capital structure that was highly leveraged prior to the ipo with a very low share count and a capital structure post ipo with shares of over  million so it’s a little unusual in the fourth quarter versus what we will expect going forward and i know some of the analysts that are following us have prepared estimates assuming that the ipo occurred at the beginning of the quarter so we have also released a pro forma fully diluted earnings per share that reflects what we believe our eps would have been if the ipo had occurred prior to the beginning of the quarter and in that instance our pro forma interest expense would have been  million lower resulting in net income of  million and our fully diluted earnings per share excluding special items would have been  based on our  million fully diluted share count as david mentioned earlier we did incur some special items during the fourth quarter the bulk of which related to our ipo and all the information we just shared does exclude those special items the total of those items was  million  million of that number relates to items associated with initial public offering the bulk of which is for salaries wages and benefits equity related compensation from our employee stock ownership plans as well as previous grants of equity to management that were contingent upon the ipo we also had a  million of costs related to exiting philadelphia and dallasfort worth this is part of the network changes that david discussed earlier as well these are costs associated with some small portions of leased space that we will no longer occupy now that we have left those airports and then we also have  million related to fuel marktomarket adjustments on hedges that relate to  where we could not apply hedge accounting we will include those costs in the appropriate quarters to which they relate as we report numbers in the first half of  so on a gaap basis if you include those special items our net income for the fourth quarter was  million now looking at the full year which i am pleased to say marks virgin america’s second consecutive full year profitability our full year income improved from  million in  to  million for the full year of  we achieved this from solid rasm improvement our rasm was up  yearoveryear and as david mentioned also by continuing our focus on maintaining our competitive cost structure our casm excluding special items fuel and profit sharing increased just  for the full year on flat capacity and our fuel cost declined  yearoveryear restructuring of our balance sheet was a big contributor to the improvement in net income that we had in  we cut our net interest expense in half to  million and looking at the balance sheet we ended the year with  million in cash which is roughly  of our total  revenue operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was  million but that does include a  million that was related to our initial public offering and restructuring of our balance sheet where we had  million released from some of our credit card processes that we are holding that back so excluding that item operating cash flow was roughly  million for the quarter however we did have  million collateral posted related to fuel hedges which is bit of an unusual item so adjusting for that more normalized basis our operating cash flow for the quarter would have been little under  million our ipo did dramatically change our balance sheet our leverage has significantly declined as a result of the ipo at september  we had total debt on our balance sheet of  million and we had a stockholders’ deficit at that time of  million now at year end we have a total debt outstanding balance of just  million and we have positive stockholders equity of  million so major restructuring of the balance sheet by completing the initial public offering and the related changes to our balance sheet that came with that and i will end with some commentary on our first quarter guidance that we also released this morning we expect the first quarter  capacity to increase between  and  i will caution that there have been a number of storms especially recently in the last week or two that have caused some cancellations and continued storms could change that estimate of capacity our first quarter prasm we do expect to be between minus  and plus  yearoveryear and our casm excluding fuel and profit sharing we expect to increase between  and  versus the first quarter of  we expect our realized economic fuel cost per gallon which will be inclusive of hedges and fuel related taxes to be between  and  a gallon that’s based on current forward curves and that could also change as spot fuel prices change significantly before the end of the quarter our full year casm guide remains between  and  yearoveryear and that’s primarily a result of the recently announced changes to compensation that will bring most of our work groups close to industry average this is a onetime increase we don’t expect it’s larger than we would normally expect on annualized basis going forward but it’s a reflection of our commitment to our teammates to strive for industry average compensation and by implementing the changes that we announced earlier this year in  we will bring most of our team a groups up to  very close to industry average and just a few comments on our few hedging program as well we do have a hedging program we’ve had in place since  as a smaller airline it’s important to have some protection because fuel price is such a volatile expense and it is our largest expense it’s weighted towards the next three to six months and it’s a constantly rolling program so it simply delays the impact of changes in fuel price so they are delayed when they rise which is the point of the program and they are also delayed when they fall so we’ll continue to see benefits of lower fuel prices in the second and third quarters of this year even if fuel prices change simply because of the program that we have in place and with that danielle i’d like to turn it back to you to start our qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first call comes from mike linenberg with deutsche bank your line is now open please go ahead michael linenberg great hey good morning david peter i guess two questions here the first is with the announcement of the austin service or the austin love field service and you also look at some of the other new announcements over the past five six months what percent of your system is now in new markets or markets that have been in existence less than  months and maybe you can even give it to me on an asm basis because it does seem you have a decent amount of markets that have yet to mature david cush yes mike i would say that number’s somewhere between  and  if you take all of our capacity that is in markets that are new markets and including love field as a new market distinct from dfw michael linenberg and then just back on the love field were you ever given an opportunity to make a bid or at least respond to united’s two gates there or was that just done behind the scenes and do you find it somewhat surprising that there has been nary a response from the doj i mean it just looked like that deal’s going to go through without any sort of pushback david cush yes mike we were aware there were discussions and we were aware that united was interested in moving those gates that’s just kind of in the matter of course in the airline businesses as slots and gates become available and they are talks ph around that we weren’t tremendously interested in the additional gates we were satisfied with what we had i think as far as a doj reaction i guess the assumption there is between the competition we provide in critical markets out of love field as well as what america’s doing at dfw that the doj felt comfortable and if you look at the pricing action the dfw pricing has somewhat mirrored what’s going on in love field so i would say at least in the immediate shortterm we’ve seen that the two airports are offsetting each other michael linenberg okay okay that makes sense and thank you david cush thanks operator thank you and your next call comes from david fintzen from barclays your line is now open please go ahead david fintzen hi thanks good morning everyone can we just sort of parse down a little bit what you’re seeing in new york on the transcon particularly between  a sort of your front of the airplane premium product and more of the economy but also between jfk and new york i mean some of the product innovation and capacity in jfk is that affecting new york or are the two kind of operating separately david cush well jfk in new york if you get too much of our pricing difference than you do create some preference there but in general i think when pricing is the same the people have their own airplane preference but you can move them from one airport to another if there is a pricing distinction so while new york isn’t necessarily on top of jfk pricing at all times it has to be close because otherwise you will have people either cross the hudson or not cross the hudson to get to jfk as far as what we’re seeing in the market it’s really interesting the market’s been disrupted quite a bit i would say by the capacity that’s been added and part of that  what is most visible of course is met ph but also just a number of seats that have come into the market that the market is up roughly  in terms of up capacity away capacity away from us and that’s primarily being driven by jet blue capacity increases going from four a day i believe last summer she planned eight a day in summer of  in addition when we look at the fact that they have  first class seats or indiscernible seats on each airplane that combination gives them about  of the premium seats in the jfk lax market going from position of no seats so what happened is you have got a tremendous amount of additional capacity coming on in addition to the pricing actions that are that jet blue has taken that is public information and the continue prevalence of  in that market so what we are seeing in the marketplace and what we are seeing with us is a pretty significant dilution in average fares i would in the order of  to  on market average but also a stimulation in traffic and this has impacted each airline differently of course if you look at an american or a delta for example what it is doing it is stimulating traffic which then displaces free upgrades so for them it’s kind of interesting because they have got much more exposure to it because they have such large premium cabins on the other hand they have some capability to react to it if you look at the rationale ph on us we have a small cabin of eight seats we have seen less of a fare impact but at the same time since we have also sold first class and we don’t upgrade we have less ability to go in and displace upgrades so the markets are a little bit messy right now i will say that as we look forward in our bookings things seem to be settling down looking into march and april and so hopefully it is a powerful market that in the past has been able to absorb a lot of capacity and hopefully it will see a little bit more stability going forward david fintzen and you said less fare impact for you does that also  that your products even not having a indiscernible with the last not to have a indiscernible you don’t think your difference in product is a sort of disproportionately hurting you david cush we don’t  again a part of it comes from having only eight seats so that protects us somewhat with less supply out there but we also believe that you know the smaller cap and the fact that it is a more controlled cabin with a dedicated lab ph and a dedicated flight attendant is something that’s appealing to people you know a indiscernible see other than our red eye is probably important for an hour and half or two hours of the flight the rest of the time what you want is a comfortable environment so we have held on to your customers albeit at a lower fare because of the impact of that and as of now we are sticking to our guns david fintzen okay great i appreciate all that color david cush thanks operator thank you and our next caller comes from savi syth from raymond james your line is now open please go ahead savanthi syth hey good morning just on the same topic i was wondering if you could provide a little more what you are seeing on in dallas i would have expected q prasm to be a little bit better maybe because of tougher easier comparisons i am just wondering if dallas is having more of an impact or if it’s transformed or how you look at it david cush yeah our primarily impact in the first quarter will be from dallas and if i can just give a little more color on this market you know if you look at the dallas marketplace in most of the most important markets capacity is up by  to  so this is a massive increase in capacity and a massive dislocation in what arguably is a mature market in some market such as in dca you see capacity up  so you got a situation there that is again somewhat disruptive what we have seen out of that so far is fares much lower than anyone expected whoever thought he would be able to get doubledigit fares into la guardia and dca well you can right now at the same time we have seen a lot of stimulation in the market so we are only a few months into this my strong gut feel is that this will work itself out pretty quickly also it is a limited capacity airport and that’s one of the reasons we went in to austin is that we see the very strong airport presence for love field and we can see that in the numbers that our direct booking numbers are higher than they have ever been at the same time there are a couple of structural issues with love filed that will take some time to work out the first one is awareness you know for  years you couldn’t fly to these places out of love field and just reminding people that now you can the second one i would say is there are some distribution challenges we have there in terms of city codes and  that we’re working through all of that being said we expect the challenges at dallas to be fleeting for lack of a better term we understand what they are and that’s why we’ve added these additional flights in dallas because we’re very bullish on the market savanthi syth that’s very helpful thanks and then just on the ancillary revenue great performance there i know you’re lapping here the new credit card deal how should we think about as you go forward here in  are there any big items that could drive anci revenue david cush yeah without getting too far into it we’re most excited about some additional automation that will be coming online  saber ph in the second quarter and in particular what we’re focused on is new system or new capability that’s called emd electronic miscellaneous document and this allows us to go in and variably price different ancillary products it allows us to go in and officially bundle ancillary products and perhaps just as importantly to offer these through all sales channels including all the gds’ so if you look at our capabilities right now and we did quite well in ancillary but our capabilities right now are pretty basic we have a single price for our premium seats across all routes all seats and that’s a pretty basic way of doing things this will free us up to in and initially variably priced to go in and charge different amounts on different seats on different stage lengths and different  and then ultimately perhaps dynamically priced so that as seats are taken out of the inventory that the remaining seats actually increase in price in a similar way a normal revenue management system works so we are quite excited about the capabilities at haul and if you look at our fourth quarter ancillary revenue numbers as you can see there is a lot of momentum there and we think with the capabilities that we’re getting from saber ph that certainly by the end of the second quarter we’re going to see some additional opportunities savanthi syth okay thanks operator thank you operator instructions and your next call comes from hunter keay from wolfe research your line is now open please go ahead hunter keay hi good morning and thank you thanks for the color in this call this morning it’s very helpful i appreciate it so there’s a lot of capacity in the hawaiian market right now it’s pretty clear that at all time highs and im wondering how that impacts your plans to use a number of the planes that you’re going to take later this year and next year into what is probably an oversupplied market and do you have any alternatives for growth if you guys decide that it’s unpalatable to dilute that market even further david cush well we certainly have alternatives we haven’t grown the airline in a few years we are a bit starved for growth right now we think there are a number of opportunities out there that we have not been able to take i won’t get into them but if you look at it hunter it’s five airplanes this year and five airplanes next year it’s not a lot of capacity we need to deploy that being said we have seen growth in the hawaii market in terms of capacity but our analysis right now shows that the market is absorbing that capacity quite efficiently and the revenue is growing in particular from the bay area revenue is growing with that capacity so we’re going to keep a close eye on it we don’t need to make that decision today we are preparing technically all of the things that we need to prepare in order to do that so that if we make that decision from a marketing standpoint and a network standpoint we’re prepared to operate it but as of now we remain pretty bullish on the hawaii market particularly given our point of sales strength out of san francisco hunter keay got you thanks and that service would follow a sequel that’s where you’re planning on starting that at some point commensurate with when you take delivery of these aircraft i mean at this point of time is that generally the plan david cush im sorry can you repeat that hunter keay yeah so should we think about if you guys do decide to start that market we should pretty much assume it’s going to start roughly in line with when you actually take delivery of the aircraft david cush i would say certainly it cannot start before call it october the first airplane we get into service would be in the late august and then of course we got  even if we wanted to get in as quickly as possible you got test rounds and other things that need to happen so i would say that’s the earliest it could possibly happen hunter keay okay great and then a question on the casm ex guide i appreciate you guys reiterating or updating the full year guide i think you said four to six but as i look at the first quarter guide it looks pretty good with pretty light asm growth so if i am thinking about asm growth coming in the back half of the year and the north of  range does that  is there some conservatism to this casm exguide or am i just  or is this just sort of the math of the way that the money is moving around between profit sharing and the wage line is that just pretty much is what it is or you guys being maybe a little bit concerned about your thinking about that there are still some moving parts that youre not sure of at this point david cush well it is the math between profit sharing versus regular salaries wages and benefits that was impacting that its also that the salary increases that we announced earlier dont actually  theyre not implemented until april  so we wont see a lot of impact from those yearoveryear until the second quarter so thats why youll see the casm will tick up in the second third and fourth quarters yearoveryear because thats where it will have this big change associated with the underlying fixed component of salary wages and benefits thats the biggest reason hunter keay okay great thanks appreciate it guys david cush thank you hunter peter hunt i think what  i may want to give a little color on the changes we made to wages and in particular i think one thing thats been overlooked is the philosophical reason for our change in profit sharing that we went and created a threshold earnings per aircraft before profit sharing kicks on and philosophically what were trying to do is to go and say that not only do we need to be profitable but we need to achieve an acceptable return on invested capital on the assets we have before we start sharing what i would call excess profits with our team mates so our team mates really understood that that need to make sure the investors are all taken care of so the capital is available in the future as we need it and this was the right step forward structurally in order to do that operator thank you and your next call comes from dan mckenzie from buckingham research your line is now open please go ahead daniel mckenzie yes hey good morning guys thanks for the time here just i am wondering if you can help us understand the economic changes that are occurring in the bay area it seems to me things are picking up and accelerating but i am wondering if you can just help add some color to whats going on there how that is helping to drive demand that i think that virgin is especially levered at san francisco market as well as los angeles and then essentially how that would tie to perhaps how seasonality might change for your airline as you look at this summer versus say past summers just given whats happening economically today in san francisco david cush well of course this area has had very strong growth for a number of years and doesnt seem to be slowing down and in some way seems to be accelerating i think there is a good side and a bad side of that of course the good side is there is a lot more business and a lot of good business and in particular corporate business where weve been quite successful in the corporate arena and especially successful with san franciscobased companies the flipside of course is thats one of the great things about our industry is it is competitive because people move to where the money is so we are seeing additional capacity coming into san francisco we are seeing additional interest from the other carriers and that’s something that were prepared to withstand but this industry doesnt it doesnt operate and above when people see opportunities they go and try to take advantage of it so from our perspective were happy were here it’s been a good part of whats driven our company were happy that the revenue environment is strong and in particular with the firms that are growing here they like our product because it resonates with kind of their demographic so i am not sure i answered your question other than to say its a vibrant market but one that also attracts a lot of competitors daniel mckenzie okay thats it from me thanks operator thank you this concludes the questionandanswer portion of our call id like to turn the conference back over to abby lunardini abby lunardini thank you all very much for taking the time to join todays call should you have any

america former american airlines executive takes helm of virgin america    back to gallery virgin america the discount carrier that recently took up residence at san francisco international airport has named an american airlines executive as new its chief executive officer succeeding fred reid who was required to leave the company under the terms of the airlines contentious federal certification process c david cush  whose last position at fort worthbased american airlines was senior vice president of global sales was selected by the virgin america board of directors which is chaired by donald j carty the former ceo of amr corp parent of american airlines latest business videos in an interview from his home in dallas cush said it would take a unique opportunity to lure me away from american airlines and he said he found that exact situation when he read the virgin america business plan that vows to put fun back in air travel where i believe this company wants to go is to predictability and efficiency on the ground and pleasant and fun in the air cush said well keep it very focused on the consumer that has to be the central idea of anything the company does going forward at american airlines cush was responsible for all sales and distribution activities worldwide he also served as vice president of americans st louis hub and before that he was vice president of international planning and global alliances cush also held management positions in finance sales and marketing customer service and operations in addition to his years at american airlines cush served as chief operating officer of aerolineas argentinas the national carrier of argentina virgin america which launched in august at sfo is the only californiabased airline and is headquartered in burlingame it has more than  employees is operating  airplanes and has firm orders for  more in the airbus a family reid  the former president and chief operating officer of delta air lines was named chief executive officer on april   and steered the nascent operation through the fundraising and certification process virgin america is a usowned and controlled company but there was a perception of foreign ownership in part because the carrier licenses the virgin brand from britishbased virgin group headed by sir richard branson competitors of virgin america a lowcost airline tried to derail its certification application by challenging its claim that the virgin group is a minority share investor foreign citizens are barred from owning more than  percent of a us airlines or exercising operational control virgin america was certified but the federal government said reid would have to leave the company because of the original foreign ownership concerns reid said he has no immediate plans thats a neat thing to say ive never been able to say that he said maybe ill find success at blueberry farming after all he said raising capital had been difficult and that certification with more than  checklist items that had to be accomplished was complex yes its very nice that we are able to license the virgin brand but that is a brand agreement everything else is sweat equity reid said yes we are proud to fly the virgin flag but it is worth nothing unless we perform here cush was born and raised in shreveport la he received a bachelor of fine arts degree in broadcastfilm and a bachelor of science degree in psychology from southern methodist university both in  he received an master of business administration from the university a year later he assumes his new position dec

inc virgin america ceo david cush opens up  chris mcginnis chris mcginnis virgin america ceo david cush opens up by chris mcginnis on july   at  pm print virgin america ceo david cush at the launch ceremonies for its new flights to toronto in the midst of a very busy week launching his airline’s new service between sfo and toronto virgin america ceo david cush sat down for an email interview with the bat check out what he has to say about flights to chicago virgin’s appeal to business travelers his vision for sfo’s terminal  virgin’s improving financial performance and how its sfo market compares to its lax market the bat why did virgin pick toronto as its next city instead of say chicago which your business travel customers are really rooting for speaking of will virgin fly to chicago any time soon is it still on your radar will you fly to chicago this year david cush we’re gearing up for major growth this year with expansion to five new destinations this year alone cabo san lucas and cancun in mexico for example we have still been unable to come to a resolution with chicago on gate space at that airport — but it remains high on our list and we hope to be able to enter o’hare in  with little to no low fare competition from the west coast to ohare we’re still planning on entering the market and we know that consumers will benefit when we do with lower fares and better choices the bat you’ve been in the news a lot this week with the new launch to toronto how did that go david cush toronto is a worldclass business and leisure destination so it has always been on our list and of course the virgin brand has deep roots there torontopearson airport welcomed us with open arms – but the o’hare situation certainly accelerated our growth into canada for more frequent updates about bay area travel follow the bat on twitter the bat what is virgin’s business travelleisure travel mix out of sfo how difficult is it for virgin to go up against united with its mileage plus program and multitude of nonstop flights how would you gauge your success in convincing high mileage ual flyers to give virgin a try which airline at sfo would you say is your biggest competitor david cush sfo is our home so we compete against everyone here but we see our primary competitors as the legacy carriers on longhaul we have a pretty even mix of business and leisure travelers but the trend we have seen is a lot more business travelers converting to us given our “office in the sky” features like wifi power outlets inflight tv with live cnn cnbc and our premium cabins first and main cabin select services we’ve been pretty successful because at the end of the day if you give people a better product at a great price– you are going to do well the other thing we have found is that once people try us they tend to come back note virgin america now has nearly  million members in elevate its frequent flyer program the bat i recently made a video about sfo’s terminal  which will be the home of virgin america starting next spring can you give us a glimpse of what you envision for that space what will make it uniquely virgin how much of a say do you have in the design of the space do you think upscale customers will complain about not being in the glam international terminal at sfo with access to the virgin atlantic lounge david cush the project was in our plans from prelaunch given our growth trajectory we’ve had an opportunity to work with sfo and gensler the architect to develop a design that captures the best parts of san francisco and california the use of new technology a focus on innovative design and sustainable building practices our goal has always been to reinvent the entire flight experience by harnessing the best in new design and technology — and creating an environment people actually want to stay in so awardwinning food comfortable seating cabin design wifi t is doing the same on the airport level there will be a lot of focus on design there will be a “slow food” vendors on the concourse preferential hybrid car parking — all those california cliches but in a good way we’re also working to ensure that our space at t will be at least leed gold certified — which will be a first the bat how is virgin america doing financially are you anywhere near profit yet when do you expect the airline to be in the black how has the recent news of recovery in the airline business translated for virgin is the company on solid financial ground what’s your expected load factor this summer what are your best performing routes david cush even though we saw much higher fuel cost related to hedging in the quarter– we also reported record revenue performance — with a  percent jump in revenue year over year so even with the near doubling of fuel our top line progress continued to exceed our expectations and we remain on track for full year operating profit in  in line with the rest of the industry we’re forecasting a very strong remainder of the year with high loads throughout summer is particularly strong and we’re seeing great performance across the board the longhaul is really where our product stands out for example our boston routes are very strong — and our techforward service seems to resonate with travelers there and they are bound to get even more biz on this route when american nixes sfobos flights in november which we covered last week in the bat the bat lax seems to be a really important market for virgin and almost as big as sfo– i know that lax now has  daily departures compared to sfo’s …that’s pretty close which is a better performing market for virgin sfo or lax how would you compare your customer base in lax to sfo david cush la has and always will be a focus city for us and we will continue to grow there — it is a great market for us we are the only airline headquartered in california sfo is our home and lax will always be a major focus our product and amenities resonates with la travelers and we see a lot of entertainment media traffic along those routes along with the hightech business traffic out of sfo virgin america ceo david cush sir richard branson and board

ethiopia though not always but under this name there seem to be included not less than three different countries a the oriental cush comprehending the regions of persis chusistan and susiana in persia it lay chiefly to the eastward of the tigris hither we may refer the river gihon genesis  zephaniah  see eden b the hebrews also in the opinion of many used cush and cushan habakkuk  to designate the southern parts of arabia and the coast of the red sea from this country originated nimrod who established himself in mesopotamia genesis  the ethiopian woman too whom moses married during the march of

derived its name the question of the precise locality of the land of cush has given rise to not a little controversy the second river of paradise surrounded the whole land of cush genesis  rv the term cush is in the old testament generally applied to the countries south of the israelites it was the southern limit of egypt ezek  av ethiopia  hebrews cush with which it is generally associated psalm  isaiah  jeremiah  etc it stands also associated with elam isaiah  with persia ezek  and with the sabeans isaiah  from these facts it has been inferred that cush included arabia and the country on the west coast of the red sea rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as khuzistan on the east side of the lower tigris but there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a cush in africa the ethiopia so called by the greeks of africa ezekiel speaks  comp  of it as lying south of egypt it was the country now known to us as nubia and abyssinia isaiah  zephaniah  hebrews cush in ancient egyptian inscriptions ethiopia is termed kesh the cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts stretching from the upper nile to the euphrates and tigris at an early period there was a stream of migration of cushites from ethiopia properly so called through arabia babylonia and persia to western india the hamite races soon after their arrival in africa began to spread north east and west three branches of the cushite or ethiopian stock moving from western asia settled in the regions contiguous to the persian gulf one branch called the cossaeans settled in the mountainous district on the east of the tigris known afterwards as susiana another occupied the lower regions of the euphrates and the tigris while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf whence they afterwards emigrated to the mediterranean and settled on the coast of palestine as the phoenicians nimrod was a great cushite chief he conquered the accadians a tauranian race already settled in mesopotamia and founded his kingdom the cushites mingling with the accads and so forming the chaldean nation a benjamite of this name is mentioned in the title of psalm  cush was
