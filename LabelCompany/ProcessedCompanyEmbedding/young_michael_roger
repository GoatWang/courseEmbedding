rogers practical futurist facebook twitter subscribe blog july  will cash disappeari worked last week with a major credit card company and one topic was whether cash will disappear  will there come a day when all transactions are electronic perhaps using your smart phoneor even say just your fingerprintand cash will be kept only in museums   some countries are almost therein sweden for example half the banks keep no cash on hand many restaurants and coffee houses no longer accept cash and churches flea markets and even panhandlers take mobile phone payments for merchants going cashless lessens the threat of robbery and eliminates daily treks to the bank this summer in the united states visa international announced it will give  grants to selected restaurant and food vendors who agree to stop accepting cash merchants of course also pay a fee for every electronic transaction significantly more in the us than in europe   so is this the end of cash  as the saying goes it’s complicated electronic payments may be more convenient but cash is still anonymous  as a result cash fuels criminal ventures as well as tax evasion large bills in particular  in s is a convenient stack only about  inches high the eu will stop printing € notes a criminal favorite in  and there are calls to eliminate the  bill in the us   and cash also powers the underground economy for tax evasion governments in short might be just as happy to get rid of cash entirely  but many lawabiding citizens consider the privacy of cash a valuable optioneven though they may not actually take advantage of it very often  it’s comforting to know that it’s there and they’re likely to complain loudly if it’s threatened  when india removed some large bills from circulation in late  the result was a monthslong national crisis that nearly brought down the government my guess is that governments won’t go to the trouble of eliminating cash what they will do is make cash increasingly less attractive to use  in southern italy where i spend part of the year the “black” economy is hugework is done off the books and paid for with cash  but the italian government has gradually made it harder to withdraw or deposit even moderate amounts of cash at the bank without paperwork and questions  the us has similar bank regulations but for much larger amounts  for now on the other end of the scale next year italy will also stop minting  and  cent coins merchants will still be allowed to price merchandise at say €but you’ll only get that price if you pay electronically   for cash the price will be rounded up to €  the result is another subtle nudge toward cashless transactions   cash is likely to be with us much longer than many futurists predict  the real question may be who will bother to use it     comments may  whos watching the babysometimes i joke that we’ve been talking about the millennial generation for so long they got old old enough at least to start families  and thus millennials were a central focus at the juvenile product manufacturers association conference in california where i spoke earlier this month  the jpma represents companies that serve the prenatal to toddler phase of parentingcar seats strollers feeding furniture and increasingly baby monitors  and not just baby monitors but really smart baby monitors the “connected nursery” was a big topic at the show  sleep trackers like the mimo integrated into little kimonos or body suits now connect wirelessly with for example your nest thermostat so if baby is too warm the nursery heat turns down  or your video monitor will notify you when baby starts to move smart scales track and record baby weight precisely and smart diaper clips will let you know when baby needs changing there is even a smart sound machine that detects when baby is stirring and will play soothing natural sound or lullabies or project animations on the ceilingand if all else fails puts mom on the line to have a twoway chat  all of course controlled by a smartphone app clearly it’s early days for these devices and physicians warn they’re no substitute for vigilant parents  there is even suggestion that some of these devices should be approved by the fda  but as a trend it’s inevitable and there’s more in store  besides watching and enjoying baby of course the other new  parent activity is worrying and asking for advice  already there are simple applications for amazon’s voicepowered alexa that will verbally answer a limited range of parenting advice questions  it’s not hard to imagine a future in which an artificial intelligencelike ibm’s watson or google’s deepmindcan be loaded with an encyclopedic body of baby and childcare information  mom or dad will be able to ask aloud any time day or night their crucial questions “is this rash normal”  and get an immediate authoritative answer or that intelligent baby advisor in the cloud could monitor the smart scales and other monitors in the “connected nursery” so it can answer questions like “is my baby’s weight normal today” the only question it probably can’t answer is whether your baby is the cutest baby ever  for that you still need grandparents   comments april  a look back at climate changeas a science writer i always looked for stories about the future so it’s no surprise that i started covering global warming and climate change during the late ’s  recently going through my files i ran across one of those stories from  that ran on the cover of the los angeles times sunday magazine   what’s interesting now is how clear the science was even back thenand how relatively uncontroversial the topic seemed  i wrote about the researchers at scripps oceanic laboratory who were then arguably the leaders in atmospheric research   the scripps researchers seemed confident that there was still time to slow or even stop the warming trend as long as society acted relatively quickly  i think back then the success in the seventies of the global community at banning freonto prevent atmospheric ozone destructionwas still a recent memory  of course the world would rally to prevent an even bigger hazard and back then there were no climate change skeptics for me to quotesomething i would have done in my normal sciencewriting practice  certainly there was no one from the fossil fuel industry to quote back then their own researchers were also concerned about global warming  what strikes me now about the story is its calm innocence given how politically charged and divisive the issue has become in the united states back then i don’t think anyone on the science side suspected what kind of opposition waited ahead as the fossil fuel industry moved to protect its commercial interests   ironically they learned quickly within a couple of years two of the scripps researchers i profiled in the article were deep into the political thickets  roger revelle sometimes called “the father of global warming” under dubious circumstances was made coauthor of an article that questioned the need for action on the issue  his young assistant justin lancaster publicly protested that his professor hadn’t been fully aware of the content of the article and that it didn’t reflect his views  very quickly an early group of global warming deniers sued lancaster  to avoid a lawsuit he couldn’t afford the young researcher withdrew his statementalthough years later as revelle’s apparent skepticism was repeatedly cited he went back on the record   but perhaps we should have suspected back then just how powerfully the fossil fuel industry would attack the science it was after all much earlier in the century that another writer upton sinclair observed that its hard to get a man to understand a thing when his paycheck depends on his not understanding it   for anyone interested in a bit of scientific nostalgia a pdf of the article is here   comments february  when the computer is watchingi recently helped with a research paper on the future of “algorithms”a oncetechy term that now generically refers to computer software that uses rules to make decisions software for example that takes complex data like your financial information and then generates a credit score  algorithms now do everything from pricing airline tickets in real time to perfecting longterm weather forecasts the basic question of the research was simple is the increasing use of algorithms to manage society good or bad  as with almost any technology the answer of course is bothbut for the most part algorithms are invisible there’s one technique however that i think will attract increasing attention the combination of smart algorithms with computer vision   video surveillance cameras for example in airport parking lots can now be connected to smart algorithms to analyze movement  they can tell the difference between a traveler returning to their car and someone who is casing vehicles for smashandgrab thefts  in the latter case the software will alert a human security guard who comes out to check the situation  the system never dozes off or gets bored or distracted  it’s always watching so too are the cameras in a recent retail store application where the security cameras observe not only the customers but the employees as well  using facial recognition the cameras track every interaction each sales clerk has with the public   at the end of the day algorithms produce a report on just how the clerk performeddid they ignore customers  were they shy about approaching people  how did their behavior relate to the sales they rang up on the register   as the creators of the system put it the report give managers the opportunity of a “teachable moment” with each employee at the end of the day   or maybe it’s more of a threatening moment  comments january  what will endure from a few weeks ago in new york i was interviewed for a history channel documentary called this is history   the show is based on a new pew research center poll that asked four different american generationsfrom millennials through the greatest generationto name the  most significant historical events of their lifetimes   for starters the differences between generations clearly reflected their ages for boomers and the greatest generation civil rights the jfk assassination and vietnam figured large  gen x and the millennials on the other hand named school shootings like columbine and sandy hook or terrorist attacks such as orlando and the boston marathon   interestingly each generation also had its own unique historical recollection not shared with any other generation the korean war for the greatest generation martin luther king’s assassination for boomers the challenger disaster for gen x and the great recession for millennials in the end however all generations agreed on five key events jfk’s assassination september  obama’s election the iraqafghanistan warsand the tech revolution that last choice is noteworthy considering that “the tech revolution” is neither a heartstopping historical moment nor an intensely emotional national experience   no one ever asks “where were you when you heard about the tech revolution”  yet technologic change has a place in the national memory that ranks with major social movements and tragic assassinations that’s what i talked about in the history channel interview  it’s obvious that  will be remembered historically for the rise of nationalistic populism as evidenced by the brexit referendum and donald trump’s victory  and there are of course lots of explanations for surging populism ranging from anxiety over immigration to globalism and middle class malaise yet i think that underlying this political upheaval is another chapter in the tech revolution the oncoming ability of machines and software to replace human laborfrom fast food workers and truck drivers to young lawyers and accountants  this chapter is still on its first pages but already a broad segment of the population feels the economic earth moving beneath their feet a vague sense that the fundamentals of labor and employment are changing and not in a good way for human beings  of course that’s far too nebulous a threat to win a political campaign so politicians turn to easier targets like illegal immigrants and overseas factories   but i think history will ultimately remember the populist uprising of  as a distant early warning signal of a much larger economic crisis to come  and that crisis will for yet another generation be among their ten most significant events      comments october  future challenges for human resourcessomeone asked me recently what were the biggest challenges ahead in the hr world  i spend a lot of time talking with those key figures in businessthe people who manage the peopleand at the moment id say there are three broad areas the softskills gap in some younger workers  broadly these are skills involving communications collaboration unstructured problemsolving etc  i worked with one fortune  firm last year that’s planning a remedial social skills” course for certain new hires   this isn’t the same tired old knock on the millennials—it’s rather recognizing that technology inadvertently impacts the development of soft skills for at least some in adolescence and emerging adulthood  it’s a fixable issue that needs to be addressed in k and college but until that happens the remediation will fall to employers the challenge of virtual workplaces  whether managers like it or not we are moving to a much more dispersed partially virtual workforce  the drivers include the cost of real estate and energy the burden of commuting including traffic congestion and sometimes the preferences of the talented young workers we want   i worked with a whiteshoe law firm in manhattan recently who basically promised a partnership to a young woman who graduated harvard law with a stellar record  she turned them down—she’d interned for them one summer disliked the lifestyle—and said she would take a job but she wanted to live in colorado  the older partners were stunned but finally gave in  she works in colorado where she skis and hikes and commutes into manhattan once a month  of course the physical office is not going away—but it will be more of a place for collaboration than solitary work  and it will be festooned with telepresence video screens that connect separate offices via alwayson “windows”  among the challenges for hr how do you create corporate culture and evaluate employees in a mixed realvirtual workplace  what are the metrics to determine whether a job or business trip is better handled in the real world or virtually —the looming issue of white collar automation  cognitive computing—the newest evolution of artificial intelligenceis performing many lowlevel white collar and even professional tasks more cheaply and often better than humans  we already see the impact in services like accounting and law and advertising where the entrylevel jobs the traditional stepping stones to full professional responsibility and client contact are being automated  what do you do with new workers while they are learning the practicalities of the job   but white collar automation will also ultimately strike more broadly and result in repeated downsizing and restructuring in many sectors  a key response for hr is to encourage employees toward skills that can’t or won’t be done by computersand also how to work with cognitive computers in collaborative ways —the new jobs marketplace  the agingout workforce the shortfalls of our educational system and the move toward highly specialized job functions means that by next decade employers may be chasing a smaller and smaller pool of qualified candidates  and those job candidates may not fully believe in the ability of any corporation to offer them longterm secure careers   taken to its extreme one could imagine young workers with highly valued ofthemoment skills marketing themselves in an online marketplace in which employers compete and bid up salaries a bit like professional athletes  these indemand employees want to maximize their current payout knowing that as they grow older they may need to take time off to retrain and reenter the workforce  comments july  the future of futuristslast week farhad manjoo the technology columnist for the new york times had a thoughtful piece on the death of the early futurist alvin toffler most famous for his book future shock   toffler’s thesis back in  was simple “change is avalanching upon our heads” he wrote “and most people are grotesquely unprepared to cope with it” fortysix years later says manjoo ”it seems clear that his diagnosis has largely panned out with local and global crises arising daily from our collective inability to deal with everfaster change”  yet at the same time fewer and few institutions are even thinking about the future in substantive ways it wasn’t always thus in the seventies various organizations such as rand and sri worked for the government projecting the future of global politics and nuclear weapons the office of technology assessment was established by congress in  to look at the future impact of impending legislation but by the mid’s when the ota was shut down the idea of futurism was distinctly tarnished  says manjoo  “futurism’s reputation for hucksterism became selffulfilling as people who called themselves futurists made and sold predictions about products and went on the conference circuit to push them”  alas too true  when i began speaking about the future i was most reluctant to use the futurist word  having spent twenty years in handson work inventing new media i didn’t take futurists seriously they often lacked technical understanding or real business experience or both  too often their predictions veered off into either science fiction or simply what they’d like to see happen  futurists became famous for their perennial predictions of flying cars  the one below was supposed to arrive in  thus when the new york times asked me to be futuristinresidence i tried to talk them out of that title i’d been around journalists for a long time and i feared that no one in the nyt newsroom was likely to take someone called a “futurist” very seriously  but the newspaper insisted and in the end i decided that when the new york times wants to call you something you might as well go with it    as it turned out the title worked  when there is a “futurist” in the room it gives everyone permission to untether at least briefly from quarterly reports and annual budgets  the time spent thinking out five to eight years is then very helpful when discussion returns to the hereandnow  a number of the organizations i’ve worked with in the past few years have initiated real changes in directions and strategy after a few hours of contemplating the world of the early twenties futurism is not dead rather as foresight has left the political process it has instead become more local  and its still a very good discipline for organizations and corporations to pursue  as another early futurist kenneth boulding once said “the future will always surprise us but we must not let it dumbfound us”  thats the very least we should ask from our futurists comments june  a few media appearancesheres a recent interview i did with speakingcom one of the leading speaking agency websites   and another interesting project with the atlantic       comments june  how i landed on an isis hit listone morning a few weeks ago three new york city policemen came to my door  not ordinary officers but members of the counter terrorism task force working with the fbi  they wanted me to know that my name and address had just appeared on a isis hit list of  new yorkers released on a messaging app under the tag we want them dead great way to start the day  however the officers were quick to say that the fbi didn’t think this was a serious threatthere wasn’t a clear pattern to the names on the list and some of the information was quite outofdate of course one said handing me his card if you see anything unusual give us a call but it appeared to be almost random new york names and addresses picked up from somewhere on the internet  random  i asked to see some pages from the list  by far the most names were from my borough brooklyn  then i recognized a few neighbors and immediately suspected what had happened  brooklyn may be the world center of worthy causes  universal prek ban plastic bags widen the bicycle lanesyou name it and we have a group for it  i’m partial to a worthy cause once in a while and so are some of my more activist neighbors  we sign petitions donate end up on mailing listsand in databases many of the worthy causes sooner or later win or lose their battles run out of money or just fade away  but sometimes their internet databases live on perhaps tended by a volunteer with limited time perhaps not tended at all aging database software is easy prey for even lowskilled hackers  i suspect that somewhere among the defunct worthy causes is where isis collected their list  why did they even bother  as a kind of psychological warfare perhaps as well as a way to get publicity and waste some us law enforcement time  but there’s a larger issue here  for my audiences internet security is at the top of everyone’s mind  many fear from the stories they’ve read that real online security is impossible  i remind them that most of the big notorious computer hacks we read about actually used very simple techniquesmore often than not exploiting human fallibility rather than esoteric technology  those human foibles range from clicking on links in unknown emails to well leaving a database abandoned online  the solution is broader than just trying to educate employees by then its probably already too late we need education that starts in elementary school  we teach kids how to cross the street safely and that if they leave their bike far from home sooner or later it’s going to disappear  it becomes what we call common sense  online security awareness should also be taught from an early ageso that leaving a database of names and addresses untended on the internet is as unthinkable as leaving for vacation with your front door open comments march  playing with the future of workthis month the big news in computer science circles was that google’s alphago software beat the world’s top player in the ancient game of go winning four out of five games in a milliondollar contest   the win is significant because go is a far more complex game than chess  computers can win at chess simply by computing all the implications of every possible move on the boardthat’s millions of possibilities but entirely doable by a fast computer  go on the other hand has so many possible moves that human go champions develop a kind of intuition that has been impossible to imitate in software until now  the alphago program has intuitiona broad sense of the game that it learned first by studying the records of previous matches and then by playing millions of practice go games against itself  and the computer’s intuition appears to be better or at least different than the human version  as one highlevel go player commented “it’s like another intelligent species opening up a new way of looking at the worldand much to our surprise it’s a new way that’s more powerful than ours” this socalled cognitive computingthe ability to learn from data and experience and develop new skillsis a key piece of artificial intelligence  and it has the potential to impact a broad range of whitecollar jobs  this will start with entrylevel jobs  take law as an example  as the saying goes law school doesn’t teach you to practice law  so traditionally law firms keep new lawyers busy doing work like research sorting through evidence in cases and drafting contracts  along the way they learn the practical aspects of law   now however intelligent software can do many of those entrylevel legal jobs often better and always more cheaply  big accounting firms are going through a similar transition as more and more accounting tasks are automated  and many entrylevel corporate jobs also turn out to be easily automated  these perturbations in the whitecollar world are early warning signs of a much broader social issue  sooner or later artificial intelligence and robots will eliminate a broad swath of wellpaying jobs and it’s not at clear where new jobswith equivalent salarieswill come from  the challenge from smart computers will be very real and this time it won’t be a game  comments pagesnext ›last » connect subscribe to the rss
