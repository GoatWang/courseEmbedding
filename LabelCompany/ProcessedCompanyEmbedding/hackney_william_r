to key west in  where he remained until  he was a practicing attorney and kept a diary of which only parts survived the key west library has a copy of all surviving portions it was transcribed by dr robert l goulding hackley’s maternal grandfather the hackley family is an important part of early florida history         most of the diary is of key west however we pick up with mr hackley visiting the upper keys and he briefly refers to indian key in  should the reader only wish to read the entries referring to indian key i have placed an  at those entries           “   thursday feby th  got under weigh a little before sunrise wind nw and beat up to indian key and came to anchor about  pm we stretched out in the gulf out of sight of land and in going in the capt caught two fish that would weigh around  pounds they were  ft long one broad with an upper bill projecting out  foot they were nearly black but in dying exhibited a change of colour and has on the back a fin  inches long and  broad which gave them a beautiful appearance in the water and two pectoral fins of  inches length and  broad the natives of the bahamas call this a pike it is a very good fish        “friday feb   got under weigh at daylight with the wind ne and stood out to the reef and stood back to the harbour and came to anchor    the john dennison came in and i received a letter from mother and b papers captn wm barker went down to key west with a load of cotton from the british brig marcelly of grenack capt monroe who got ashore on the bar at bear cut on the th instant from new orleans bound to glascow with  bales she is a total loss and the cotton is all landed on the beach after breakfast went on shore on lignum vitae key where capt rooke has built a house for the purpose of obtaining preemptive right a method of obtaining the right to purchase land before the homestead act it is about three miles from indian key and is about  miles in circumference and is heavily timbered and a fine soil in one place when a well was dug a quantity of stiff red clay was found a quantity of lignum vitae grows on the key from whence it derives its name capt bunce went on shore for the purpose of going down to duck key wrote a note to mr browne      “saturday feb th rose just before daylight and after an early breakfast went up to lignum vitae key the men went to work thatching the house and i took a walk thro the woods i found the land very good and not difficult to be cleared the house is made of posts set in the ground and poles nailed across and palmetto leaves tied to them which forms a tight roof and lasts about five years got aboard about dark       “sunday febth rose about daybreak and after breakfast went to lignum vitae key to look at some traps set last night for raccoons  they took none and we hunted the woods with the same success got on board at  past  read roccus and remained on board all evening as i dislike indian key so much that unless i have business i am determined not to go ashore        “monday feby th rose at daybreak after breakfast went up to lignum vitae key and took all hands to finish the house which was done and it makes a much more pleasant one than i had supposed possible the leaves look rather rough on the outside but within they present a pretty appearance about  pm mr burton and two men took the boat and went to look for stone crabs i accompanied him and waded for more than a hour up to my knees in the water the crab lives in a hole generally under some stones from which they are very difficult to be taken they are nearly round with very large claws and are much larger than the common crab and much more delicate eating got on board after sunset wind blowing fresh from ne and about  past  it began to rain but very little fell the capt rooke left one of his men to prepare the ground for planting during his absence to fill his water at the cape cape florida      “march st  florida reef rose at daybreak the wind blowing so fresh from the ne that we do not like to undertake to beat up to the cape probably cape florida and therefore did not get under way last night there were  wrecking vessels out of  which are now on the reef in the harbour and at anchor read the “peace campains of cornet sic”        “wednesday march nd rose at daybreak and got under weigh to beat up the reef with wind ene made one or two tacks when we found that the wind was so fresh and the sea so high that it was needless to attempt to get up and so we ran back and came to anchor at indian key read hungarian tales after dinner took a sail with the capt up to lignum vitae key         “thursday march rd   got under weigh at daybreak with a single reefed mainsail foresail with the bonnet off and standing jib the wind in squalls from about ne and a heavy sea even inside of the reef about  am discovered a ship on shore which proved to be the amulet of duxbery g wisdom mstr from boston to new orleans  at pickles reef off of tavernier key in  ft of water and she draws  on our arrival we found  sloops and one schooner at anchor and we came too about half a mile from the ship in a position in some degree sheltered by the rocks but even then the schooner rolled heavily the ship lay on her bilge the widest part of her bottom and the breakers were white all around her and now and then i could see a sea break on her stern and flying foam all over her  one of the sloops was anchored at a  mile and had a warp a rope to pull with to the ship by means of which by hauling the boats thro’ the midst of the breakers the cargo was transferring on board of the wrecking vessels capt rooke hackley’s captain went on board but there was enough without him we went in about sunset and anchored in tavanier sic whilst at anchor on the reef the cutter marion pass sic on her way to charleston        “friday march th got under weigh at  past  and beat out to the reef the ships still in the same position bore up and stood for the cape and at about  before  came to anchor off the mouth of the miami river capt barker and monroe came on board and capt rooke agreed to take a load of cotton to key west for  a bale mr burton and myself went up the river to procure water saw some ducks but killed none i left the boat and walked down the river for a short distance the land has the appearance of being very rich being black mould the grass on the openings which are frequent being more than waist high        “saturday march th got under weigh at  am and beat up to bear cut north miami beach where the cotton was landed from the aforementioned brig the schrs wm ross and pizarro and sloop energy are here to take a load the brig has been burnt to obtain the copper  c her stem  a stern part now alone remains sic to show the spot she struck about half a mile from shore took my gun and walked about  miles up the beach on my return killed one partridge i could have shot several but had none but duck shot too large for partridge with me”       “sunday march th rose at daylight all hands employed in loading schr i had so little success yesterday that i do not feel inclined to try the gun again read anne of grirestein and tried to fish caught a catfish and in disengaging it from the hook it stuck one of its fins in my finger which gave a great deal of pain for several hours       “monday march th rose at daylight all hands loading schr i went ashore and walked up the beach and gathered some hicaco plumes returned on board about n read roccus after dinner it became cloudy and rained a little at night the mosquitoes were so numerous so
