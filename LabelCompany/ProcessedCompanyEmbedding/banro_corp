intruded by porphyry sills folded into a series of broad anticlines and synclines and subjected to very lowgrade metamorphism the gold mineralization at the main twangiza deposit is hosted within mudstones siltstones greywackes and porphyries along the crest of a major anticlinal structure gold mineralization is of hydrothermal origin and is associated with sulfides which occur in quartzcarbonate veins and disseminations throughout the host rocks unlike the twangiza main deposit the mineralization at twangiza north is associated predominantly with feldspar porphyry sills that have intruded westerly dipping shales and siltstones with the mineralization in this lithology being nonrefractory this mineralization is open at depth and to the north where recent regolith mapping has indicated that the goldinsoil anomalism has been masked by recent colluvial and alluvium material other significant gold occurrences on banros twangizas concessions include kibizwa tshondo and

ounces produced in june “we are very pleased with the continued ramp up at namoya during the second quarter culminating in over  ounces of gold being poured in june this positions the namoya operation

increased significantly over the first quarter of  as twangiza continued to move increased amounts of waste recoveries at twangiza during the second quarter of  were impacted by the blend of ore type based on available mining faces which was exacerbated by excessive wet weather early in the second quarter the installation of the fine crushing expansion during the third quarter of  is expected to enhance both gold recoveries and mill throughput beginning with commissioning activities late in the third quarter leading to an overall increase in production the gold produced as bullion during the
