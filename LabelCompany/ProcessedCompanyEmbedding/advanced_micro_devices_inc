first twelve yearsedit advanced micro devices was formally incorporated on may   by jerry sanders along with seven of his colleagues from fairchild semiconductor sanders an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at fairchild had like many fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within that company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by  with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by  amd was producing  products – of which  were proprietary including the am a static nchannel bit ram and three lowpower schottky msi circuits amls amls and amls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit  in  by  amd entered the microprocessor market with the am a reverseengineered clone of the intel  and the am bitslice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in  it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with amd granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october  in  amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the us market siemens purchased  of amds stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving amd an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amds secondsource zilog z microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the us division in  amd closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late  after switching focus to manufacturing secondsource intel x microprocessors total sales in fiscal year  topped  million and in  amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in  production also began in amds new semiconductor fab in austin texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in penang and manila and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in san antonio in  in  amd began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with inteledit intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in  in  ibm created its pc and wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips beginning in  amd began volumeproducing secondsource intellicensed    and  processors and by  its own am clone of intels  processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some success in the mids with the amd and amd world chip fsk modem one of the first multistandard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to  baud half duplex or  full duplex beginning in  amd embraced the perceived shift toward risc with their own amd am k processor the k survived as an embedded processor the company also increased its eprom memory market share in the late s throughout the s amd was a secondsource supplier of intel x processors in  it introduced its own compatible am an amddesigned chip creating its own chips amd began to compete directly with intel amd had a large and successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust in  to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from intel amd spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into spansion a joint venture with fujitsu which had been comanufacturing flash memory with amd since  amd divested itself of spansion in december  in order to focus on the microprocessor market and spansion went public in an ipo acquisition of atiedit amd announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company ati technologies on july   amd paid  billion in cash and  million shares of its stock for a total of approximately  billion the transaction completed on october   on august   amd announced that it would retire the ati brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd brand name in october  amd announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibilliondollar joint venture with advanced technology investment co an investment company formed by the government of abu dhabi the new venture is called globalfoundries inc the partnership and spinoff gave amd an infusion of cash and allowed amd to focus solely on chip design to assure the abu dhabi investors of the new ventures success ceo hector ruiz stepped down as ceo of amd in july  while remaining executive chairman in preparation for becoming chairman of global foundries in march  president and coo dirk meyer became amds ceo recessionary losses necessitated amd cutting  jobs in  in august  amd announced that former lenovo executive rory read would be joining the company as ceo replacing meyer amd announced in november  plans to lay off more than   of its employees from across all divisions worldwide in october  it announced plans to lay off an additional  of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue amd acquired the lowpower server manufacturer seamicro in early  with an eye to bringing out an arm architecture server chip on october   amd announced that rory read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer he was succeeded by lisa su a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since june on october   amd announced a new restructuring plan along with its q results effective july   amd reorganized into two business groups computing and graphics which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets

in  intel also countersued amd renegotiating amds right to use derivatives of intels microcode for its cloned processors in the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute amd was forced to develop cleanroom designed versions of intel code for its x and x processors the former long after intel had released its own x in  in march  amd released the am its clone of the intel  processor by october of the same year it had sold one million units in  amd introduced the first of the am family of processors which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers including compaq which signed an exclusive agreement using the am another ambased processor the amx was released in november  and continued amds success as a fast costeffective processor finally in an agreement

main articles amd k amd k athlon duron and sempron amds first inhouse x processor was the k which was launched in  the k was a reference to kryptonite in comic books the only substance which could harm superman was kryptonite this is a reference to intels hegemony over the market ie an anthropomorphization of them as superman the numeral  refers to the fifth generation of x processors rival intel had previously introduced its line of fifthgeneration x processors as pentium because the us trademark and patent office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked in  amd purchased nexgen specifically for the rights to their nx series of xcompatible processors amd gave the nexgen design team their own building left them alone and gave them time and money to rework the nx the result was the k processor introduced in  although the k was based on socket  variants such as k were faster than intels pentium ii sixthgeneration processor the k was amds seventhgeneration x processor making its debut on june   under the brand name athlon unlike previous amd processors it could not be used on the same motherboards as intels due to licensing issues surrounding intels slot  connector and instead used a slot a connector referenced to the alpha processor bus the duron was a lowercost and limited version of the athlon kb instead of kb l cache in a pin socketed pga socket a or soldered directly onto the motherboard sempron was released as a lowercost athlon xp replacing duron in the socket a pga era it has since been migrated upward to all new sockets up to am on october   the athlon xp was released on february   the athlon xp with kb l cache was released athlon  opteron and phenomedit main articles athlon  opteron and phenom processor the k was a major revision of the k architecture with the most notable features being the addition of a bit extension to the x instruction set called x amd or x the incorporation of an onchip memory controller and the implementation of an extremely high performance pointtopoint interconnect called hypertransport as part of the direct connect architecture the technology was initially launched as the opteron serveroriented processor on april   shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop pcs branded athlon  on april   amd released the first dual core opteron an xbased server cpu a month later amd released the athlon  x the first desktopbased dual core processor family in may  amd abandoned the string  in its dualcore desktop product branding becoming athlon x downplaying the significance of bit computing in its processors further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dualcore desktop systems in  amd started to release dualcore sempron processors exclusively in china branded as the sempron  series with lower hypertransport speed and smaller l cache thus amd completed its dualcore product portfolio for each market segment after k came k in september  amd released the first k processors third generation opteron processors followed in november by the phenom processor for desktop k processors came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore versions with all cores on a single die amd released a new platform codenamed spider which utilized the new phenom processor as well as an r gpu and a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series however amd built the spider at nm which was uncompetitive with intels smaller and more powerefficient nm in january  amd released a new processor line dubbed phenom ii a refresh of the original phenom built using the  nm process amds new platform codenamed “dragon” utilized the new phenom ii processor and an ati r gpu from the r gpu family as well as a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series the phenom ii came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore variants all using the same die with cores disabled for the triplecore and dualcore versions the phenom ii resolved issues that the original phenom had including a low clock speed a small l cache and a coolnquiet bug that decreased performance the phenom ii cost less but was not performancecompetitive with intels midtohighrange core  quads the phenom ii also enhanced the phenoms memory controller allowing it to use ddr in a new native socket am while maintaining backwards compatibility with am the socket used for the phenom and allowing the use of the ddr memory that was used with the platform in april  amd released a new phenom ii hexacore core processor codenamed thuban this was a totally new die based on the hexacore “istanbul” opteron processor it included amds “turbo core” technology which allows the processor to automatically switch from  cores to  faster cores when more pure speed is needed the magny cours and lisbon server parts were released in  the magny cours part came in  to  cores and the lisbon part in  and  core parts magny cours is focused on performance while the lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt magny cours is an mcm multichip module with two hexacore “istanbul” opteron parts this will use a new g socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as opteron xx series processors lisbon uses c socket certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as opteron xx processors both will be built on a  nm soi process fusion becomes the amd apuedit main articles amd apu and amd mobile platform following amds  acquisition of canadian graphics company ati technologies an initiative codenamed fusion was announced to integrate a cpu and gpu together on some of amds microprocessors including a built in pci express link to accommodate separate pci express peripherals eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard the initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the cpu eg floatingpoint unit operations to the gpu which is better optimized for some calculations the fusion was later renamed to the amd apu accelerated processing unit llano was amds first apu built for laptops llano was the second apu released targeted at the mainstream market incorporating a cpu and gpu on the same die as well as northbridge functions and using socket fm with ddr memory the cpu part of the processor was based on the phenom ii deneb

gpu however the opteron a was not released until  with the delay attributed to adding software support the a was also criticed for not having support from major vendors upon its release in  amd also announced the k custom core for release in  while being armva instruction set architecture compliant the k is expected to be entirely custom designed targeting server embedded and semicustom markets the k was subsequently delayed until  in preference to the development of amds x based zen microarchitecture zen based cpus and apusedit main article zen microarchitecture zen is a new architecture for x based ryzen series cpus and apus introduced in  by amd and built from the ground up by a team led by jim keller beginning with his arrival in  and taping out before his departure in september  one of amds primary goals with zen was an ipc increase of at least  however recently amd announced that they had actually achieved a  increase processors made on the zen architecture are built on the  nm finfet node and have a renewed focus on singlecore performance and hsa compatibility previous processors from amd were either built in the  nm process bulldozer and piledriver cpus or the  nm process steamroller and excavator apus because of this zen is much more energy efficient the zen architecture is the first to encompass cpus and apus from amd built for a single socket socket am also new for this architecture is the implementation of simultaneous multithreading smt technology something intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary hyperthreading implementation of smt this is a departure from the clustered multithreading design introduced with the bulldozer architecture zen also has support for ddr memory amd released the zen based highend ryzen  summit ridge series cpus on march   with their midrange ryzen  series being launched on april   and lower end ryzen  series cpus to be released on july   amd later released the epyc line of zen

particular the vega or th generation gcn microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities semicustom and game console productsedit in  amds then ceo rory read began a program to offer semicustom designs rather than amd simply designing and offering a single product potential customers could work with amd to design a custom chip based on amds intellectual property customers pay a nonrecurring engineering fees for design and development and a purchase price for the resulting semicustom products in particular amd noted their unique position of offering both x and graphics intellectual property these semicustom designs would have design wins as the apus in the playstation  and xbox one and the subsequent playstation  pro xbox one s and xbox one x financially these semicustom products would represent a majority of the companys revenue in  other hardwareedit amd motherboard chipsetsedit see also comparison of amd chipsets before the launch of athlon  processors in  amd designed chipsets for their processors spanning the k and k processor generations the chipsets include the amd amd and the amd chipsets the situation changed in  with the release of athlon  processors and amd chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets this was the “open platform management architecture” with ati via and sis developing their own chipset for athlon  processors and later athlon  x and athlon  fx processors including the quad fx platform chipset from nvidia the initiative went further with the release of opteron server processors as amd stopped the design of server chipsets in  after releasing the amd chipset and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for opteron processors as of today nvidia and broadcom are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for opteron processors as the company completed the acquisition of ati technologies in  the firm gained the ati design team for chipsets which previously designed the radeon xpress  and the radeon xpress  chipsets amd then renamed the chipsets for amd

on may   by jerry sanders along with seven of his colleagues from fairchild semiconductor sanders an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at fairchild had like many fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within that company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by  with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by  amd was producing  products – of which  were proprietary including the am a static nchannel bit ram and three lowpower schottky msi circuits amls amls and amls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit  in  by  amd entered the microprocessor market with the am a reverseengineered clone of the intel  and the am bitslice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in  it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with amd granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october  in  amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the us market siemens purchased  of amds stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving amd an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amds secondsource zilog z microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the us division in  amd closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late  after switching focus to manufacturing secondsource intel x microprocessors total sales in fiscal year  topped  million and in  amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in  production also began in amds new semiconductor fab in austin texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in penang and manila and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in san antonio in  in  amd began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with inteledit intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in  in  ibm created its pc and wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips beginning in  amd began volumeproducing secondsource intellicensed    and  processors and by  its own am clone of intels  processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some success in the mids with the amd and amd world chip fsk modem one of the first multistandard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to  baud half duplex or  full duplex beginning in  amd embraced the perceived shift toward risc with their own amd am k processor the k survived as an embedded processor the company also increased its eprom memory market share in the late s throughout the s amd was a secondsource supplier of intel x processors in  it introduced its own compatible am an amddesigned chip creating its own chips amd began to compete directly with intel amd had a large and successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust in  to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from intel amd spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into spansion a joint venture with fujitsu which had been comanufacturing flash memory with amd since  amd divested itself of spansion in december  in order to focus on the microprocessor market and spansion went public in an ipo acquisition of atiedit amd announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company ati technologies on july   amd paid  billion in cash and  million shares of its stock for a total of approximately  billion the transaction completed on october   on august   amd announced that it would retire the ati brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd brand name in october  amd announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibilliondollar joint venture with advanced technology investment co an investment company formed by the government of abu dhabi the new venture is called globalfoundries inc the partnership and spinoff gave amd an infusion of cash and allowed amd to focus solely on chip design to assure the abu dhabi investors of the new ventures success ceo hector ruiz stepped down as ceo of amd in july  while remaining executive chairman in preparation

opteron and phenomedit main articles athlon  opteron and phenom processor the k was a major revision of the k architecture with the most notable features being the addition of a bit extension to the x instruction set called x amd or x the incorporation of an onchip memory controller and the implementation of an extremely high performance pointtopoint interconnect called hypertransport as part of the direct connect architecture the technology was initially launched as the opteron serveroriented processor on april   shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop pcs branded athlon  on april   amd released the first dual core opteron an xbased server cpu a month later amd released the athlon  x the first desktopbased dual core processor family in may  amd abandoned the string  in its dualcore desktop product branding becoming athlon x downplaying the significance of bit computing in its processors further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dualcore desktop systems in  amd started to release dualcore sempron processors exclusively in china branded as the sempron  series with lower hypertransport speed and smaller l cache thus amd completed its dualcore product portfolio for each market segment after k came k in september  amd released the first k processors third

“dragon” utilized the new phenom ii processor and an ati r gpu from the r gpu family as well as a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series the phenom ii came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore variants all using the same die with cores disabled for the triplecore and dualcore versions the phenom ii resolved issues that the original phenom had including a low clock speed a small l cache and a coolnquiet bug that decreased performance the phenom ii cost less but was not performancecompetitive with intels midtohighrange core  quads the phenom ii also enhanced the phenoms memory controller allowing it to use ddr in a new native socket am while maintaining backwards compatibility with am the socket used for the phenom and allowing the use of the ddr memory that was used with the platform in april  amd released a new phenom ii hexacore core processor codenamed thuban this was a totally new die based on the hexacore “istanbul” opteron processor it included amds “turbo core” technology

on may   by jerry sanders along with seven of his colleagues from fairchild semiconductor sanders an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at fairchild had like many fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within that company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by  with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by  amd was producing  products – of which  were proprietary including the am a static nchannel bit ram and three lowpower schottky msi circuits amls amls and amls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit  in  by  amd entered the microprocessor market with the am a reverseengineered clone of the intel  and the am bitslice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in  it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with amd granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october  in  amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the us market siemens purchased  of amds stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving amd an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amds secondsource zilog z microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the us division in  amd closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late  after switching focus to manufacturing secondsource intel x microprocessors total sales in fiscal year  topped  million and in  amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in  production also began in amds new semiconductor fab in austin texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in penang and manila and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in san antonio in  in  amd began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with inteledit intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in  in  ibm created its pc and wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips

continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some

noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by

wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips beginning in  amd began volumeproducing secondsource intellicensed    and  processors and by  its own am clone of intels  processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some success in the mids with the amd and amd world chip fsk modem one of the first multistandard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to  baud half duplex or  full duplex beginning in  amd

anthropomorphization of them as superman the numeral  refers to the fifth generation of x processors rival intel had previously introduced its line of fifthgeneration x processors as pentium because the us trademark and patent office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked in  amd purchased nexgen specifically for the rights to their nx series of xcompatible processors amd gave the

were faster than intels pentium ii sixthgeneration processor the k was amds seventhgeneration x processor making its debut on june   under the brand name athlon unlike previous amd processors it could not be used on the same motherboards as intels due to licensing issues surrounding intels slot  connector and instead used a slot a connector referenced to the alpha processor bus the duron was a lowercost and limited version of the athlon kb instead of kb l cache in a pin socketed pga socket a or soldered directly onto the motherboard sempron was released as a lowercost athlon xp replacing duron in the socket a pga era it has since been migrated upward to all new sockets up to am on october   the athlon xp was released on february   the athlon xp with kb l cache was released athlon  opteron and phenomedit main articles athlon  opteron and phenom processor the k was a major revision of the k architecture with the most notable features being the addition of a bit extension to the x

the direct connect architecture the technology was initially launched as the opteron serveroriented processor on april   shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop pcs branded athlon  on april   amd released the first dual core opteron an xbased server cpu a month later amd released the athlon  x the first desktopbased dual core processor family in may  amd abandoned the string  in its dualcore desktop product branding becoming athlon x downplaying the significance of bit computing in its processors further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dualcore desktop systems in  amd started to release dualcore sempron processors exclusively in china branded as the sempron  series with lower hypertransport speed and smaller l cache thus amd completed its dualcore product portfolio for each market segment after k came k in september  amd released the first k processors third

on may   by jerry sanders along with seven of his colleagues from fairchild semiconductor sanders an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at fairchild had like many fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within that company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by  with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by  amd was producing  products – of which  were proprietary including the am a static nchannel bit ram and three lowpower schottky msi circuits amls amls and amls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit  in  by  amd entered the microprocessor market with the am a reverseengineered clone of the intel  and the am bitslice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in  it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with amd granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october  in  amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the us market siemens purchased  of amds stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving amd an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amds secondsource zilog z microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the us division in  amd closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late  after switching focus to manufacturing secondsource intel x microprocessors total sales in fiscal year  topped  million and in  amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in  production also began in amds new semiconductor fab in austin texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in penang and manila and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in san antonio in  in  amd began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with inteledit intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in  in  ibm created its pc and wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips beginning in  amd began volumeproducing secondsource intellicensed    and  processors and by  its own am clone of intels  processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some success in the mids with the amd and amd world chip fsk modem one of the first multistandard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to  baud half duplex or  full duplex beginning in  amd embraced the perceived shift toward risc with their own amd am k processor the k survived as an embedded processor the company also increased its eprom memory market share in the late s throughout the s amd was a secondsource supplier of intel x processors in  it introduced its own compatible am an amddesigned chip creating its own chips amd began to compete directly with intel amd had a large and successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust in  to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from intel amd spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into spansion a joint venture with fujitsu which had been comanufacturing flash memory with amd since  amd divested itself of spansion in december  in order to focus on the microprocessor market and spansion went public in an ipo acquisition of atiedit amd announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company ati technologies on july   amd paid  billion in cash and  million shares of its stock for a total of approximately  billion the transaction completed on october   on august   amd announced that it would retire the ati brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd brand name in october  amd announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibilliondollar joint venture with advanced technology investment co an investment company formed by the government of abu dhabi the new venture is called globalfoundries inc the partnership and spinoff gave amd an infusion of cash and allowed amd to focus solely on chip design to assure the abu dhabi investors of the new ventures success ceo hector ruiz stepped down as ceo of amd in july  while remaining executive chairman in preparation for becoming chairman of global foundries in march  president and coo dirk meyer became amds ceo recessionary losses necessitated amd cutting  jobs in  in august  amd announced that former lenovo executive rory read would be joining the company as ceo replacing meyer amd announced in november  plans to lay off more than   of its employees from across all divisions worldwide in october  it announced plans to lay off an additional  of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue amd acquired the lowpower server manufacturer seamicro in early  with an eye to bringing out an arm architecture server chip on october   amd announced that rory read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer he was succeeded by lisa su a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since june on october   amd announced a new restructuring plan along with its q results effective july   amd reorganized into two business groups computing and graphics which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets discrete gpus and professional graphics and enterprise embedded and semicustom which primarily

followed ending in  when the supreme court of california sided with the arbitrator and amd in  intel also countersued amd renegotiating amds right to use derivatives of intels microcode for its cloned processors in the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute amd was forced to develop cleanroom designed versions of intel code for its x and x processors the former long after intel had released its own x in  in march  amd released the am its clone of the intel  processor by october of the same year it had sold one million units in  amd introduced the first of the am family of processors which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers including compaq which signed an exclusive agreement using the am another ambased processor the amx was released in

was launched in  the k was a reference to kryptonite in comic books the only substance which could harm superman was kryptonite this is a reference to intels hegemony over the market ie an anthropomorphization of them as superman the numeral  refers to the fifth generation of x processors rival intel had previously introduced its line of fifthgeneration x processors as pentium because the us trademark and patent office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked in  amd purchased nexgen specifically for the rights to their nx series of xcompatible processors amd gave the nexgen design team their own building left them alone and gave them time and money to rework the nx the result was the k processor introduced in  although the k was based on socket  variants such as k were faster than intels pentium ii sixthgeneration processor the k was amds seventhgeneration x processor making its debut on june   under the brand name athlon unlike previous amd processors it could not be used on the same motherboards as intels due to licensing issues surrounding intels slot  connector and instead used a slot a connector referenced to the alpha processor bus the duron was a lowercost and limited version of the athlon kb instead of kb l cache in a pin socketed pga socket a or soldered directly onto the motherboard sempron was released as a lowercost athlon xp replacing duron in the socket a pga era it has since been migrated upward to all new sockets up to am on october   the athlon xp was released on february   the athlon xp with kb l cache was released athlon  opteron and phenomedit main articles athlon  opteron and phenom processor the k was a major revision of the k architecture with the most notable features being the addition of a bit extension to the x instruction set called x amd or x the incorporation of an onchip memory controller and the implementation of an extremely high performance pointtopoint interconnect called hypertransport as part of the direct connect architecture the technology was initially launched as the opteron serveroriented processor on april   shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop pcs branded athlon  on april   amd released the first dual core opteron an xbased server cpu a month later amd released the athlon  x the first desktopbased dual core processor family in may  amd abandoned the string  in its dualcore desktop product branding becoming athlon x downplaying the significance of bit computing in its processors further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dualcore desktop systems in  amd started to release dualcore sempron processors exclusively in china branded as the sempron  series with lower hypertransport speed and smaller l cache thus amd completed its dualcore product portfolio for each market segment after k came k in september  amd released the first k processors third generation opteron processors followed in november by the phenom processor for desktop k processors came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore versions with all cores on a single die amd released a new platform codenamed spider which utilized the new phenom processor as well as an r gpu and a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series however amd built the spider at nm which was uncompetitive with intels smaller and more powerefficient nm in january  amd released a new processor line dubbed phenom ii a refresh of the original phenom built using the  nm process amds new platform codenamed “dragon” utilized the new phenom ii processor and an ati r gpu from the r gpu family as well as a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series the phenom ii came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore variants all using the same die with cores disabled for the triplecore and dualcore versions the phenom ii resolved issues that the original phenom had including a low clock speed a small l cache and a coolnquiet bug that decreased performance the phenom ii cost less but was not performancecompetitive with intels midtohighrange core  quads the phenom ii also enhanced the phenoms memory controller allowing it to use ddr in a new native socket am while maintaining backwards compatibility with am the socket used for the phenom and allowing the use of the ddr memory that was used with the platform in april  amd released a new phenom ii hexacore core processor codenamed thuban this was a totally new die based on the hexacore “istanbul” opteron processor it included amds “turbo core” technology which allows the processor to automatically switch from  cores to  faster cores when more pure speed is needed the magny cours and lisbon server parts were released in  the magny cours part came in  to  cores and the lisbon part in  and  core parts magny cours is focused on performance while the lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt magny cours is an mcm multichip module with two hexacore “istanbul” opteron parts this will use a new g socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as opteron xx series processors lisbon uses c socket certified for dual

platform following amds  acquisition of canadian graphics company ati technologies an initiative codenamed fusion was announced to integrate a cpu and gpu together on some of amds microprocessors including a built in pci express link to accommodate separate pci express peripherals eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard the initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the cpu eg floatingpoint unit operations to the gpu which is better optimized for some calculations the fusion was later renamed to the amd apu accelerated processing unit llano was amds first apu built for laptops llano was the second apu released targeted at the mainstream market incorporating a cpu and gpu on the same die as well as northbridge functions and using socket fm

open architecture production and fabricationedit main article globalfoundries previously amd produced its chips at company owned semiconductor foundries amd pursued a strategy of collaboration with other semiconductor manufacturers ibm and motorola to codevelop production technologies amds founder jerry sanders termed this the virtual gorilla strategy to compete with intels significantly greater investments in fabrication in  amd spun off its chip foundries into an independent company named globalfoundries this breakup of the company was attributed to the increasing costs of each process node the emirate of abu dhabi purchased the newly created company through its subsidiary advanced technology investment company atic purchasing the final stake from amd in  with the spinoff of its foundries amd became a fabless semiconductor manufacturer designing products to be produced at forhire foundries part of the globalfoundries spinoff included an agreement with amd to produce some number of products at globalfoundries both prior to the spinoff and after amd has pursued production with other foundries including tsmc and samsung it has been argued that argued this would reduce risk for amd by decreasing dependence on any one foundry which has caused issues in the past corporate affairsedit partnershipsedit amd utilizes strategic industry partnerships to further its business

posted by sreekanth anasa on june    am est related tickers amd  intc advanced micro devices inc nasdaqamd stock has been in a continuous downtrend since june th is a rebound around the corner flickr advanced micro devices inc nasdaqamd stock has struggled of late for multiple reasons and continues to be very volatile shares of the sunnyvale californiabased semiconductor company have lost more than  of their value since hitting this months high of  a share on june th the recent tech rout made things even worse for amd even the latest positive developments for amd were overlooked by investors with the stock being in the red continuously on account of overall weakness in tech stocks amid valuation concerns however this narrative could change with amds epyc server product lines expected launch on june th the shares of chipmaker have a tendency to rally ahead of major product launches so will amd stock rebound this time around as well heres what investors should take note of epyc server product could be a game changer for amd previously codenamed “naples” amds epyc server product line would be the companys first compelling offering in the data center space in more than a decade the success of the epyc server family would have a great impact on the financials of the chipmaker to put things into perspective intel nasdaqintc has an absolute majority in the datacenter space with  market share earlier in the year at its investor day the chipzilla stated that it sees the total available market tam of b for its data center business jim anderson  senior vice president  general manager amd at the recently concluded stifel nicolaus  technology internet  media conference said they estimate data center to be b tam for their offerings which includes server chips as well as graphics processors that will be used in data center compute the data center space is a very big opportunity for amd to make a mark where it is presently almost nonexistent and the leaks have hinted at epyc to be a killer product the success in data center space could be a game changer for amd mainly for two reasons firstly server solutions carry the highest asps and margins out of all the target market segments of amd with such a big market opportunity ahead the success in this segment could significantly boost the financials of the semiconductor company secondly amd is a much smaller company compared to intel and with intels monopoly in this space a minor gain in market share would be a big success for the cpu and gpu maker amd ceo dr lisa su had previously told investors that the company has set a goal of retaking  of the data center business coming to finer details here the chipzillas data center business was worth  billion in  even a  percent revenue share half of amd’s current target would be worth about  million per quarter to amd this would mean a significant addition to amds top line adding nearly onefifth of the companys q revenues a positive response to the product launch could drive the stock higher again technical outlook for amd stock the technical outlook for amd looks rather bearish in shortterm in the last trading session shares of amd made a bearish crossover closing below its crucial shortterm day simple moving averagesma of late the stock has struggled to bounce off its day sma on breaching it presently amd shares have fallen below its all key smas be it the day day or the day sma this is an overall bearish trend further moving average convergence divergence macd is on the verge of a bearish crossover the macd line is tentatively placed just a few values away from the signal line if the stock continues to be in the red then the macd line is set to make a bearish crossover in the next trading session itself playing amd stock in the recent past amd nasdaqamd stock has seen a major upward movement ahead of key events be it the ryzen cpu launch or other presentation events like its investor day the epyc product line launch could be such one event with vega gpu launch to follow a seeking alpha author in his analysis of epyc server products against intels offering has concluded that amd appears so far ahead that it is doubtful that intel can catch up with amd even with its next generation server chips amd technology group has delivered and now it is time for the sales organization to deliver amd has compelling server solutions that can take meaningful market share away from intel  such narrative in an overall sense looks very attractive for amd if amd manages to announce any major epyc adoption partner and the product also manages to live up to the expectations then this could be a game changer for the company the positive response for the epyc family could be the catalyst which could help amd overcome the bearish technical outlook and the stock may resume its uptrend however the highly volatile nature of amd stock makes it a very risky bet if youre looking for fundamentally strong tech stocks check

performance for the price sam mattera tmfmattera jan   at am amd radeon r  source msi  was volatile for amd nasdaqamd shares of the beleaguered chip giant initially surged to start the year only to tumble heading into the fall but then in the fourth quarter amd began a steady rally higher and closed the year up roughly  the companys business has been similarly shaky while it continues to lag behind its chief rival intel in pc processors and struggles to remain competitive with nvidia nasdaqnvda in the graphics market a new pc architecture coming next year zen and the longterm potential of a new graphics architecture both offer hope for a better future unfortunately few of amds  products stood out but one in particular offered solid value the radeon r x launched in november offers buyers solid performance at an attractive price doing what amd does bestin recent years amd has struggled to match nvidias highend graphics processors in terms of pure performance instead competing on value offering quality cards at more affordable prices but in  it came close to dethroning nvidia announced in june the radeon fury x is amds new highend card running on its fiji architecture however while it initially appeared promising final reviews proved less than satisfactory priced roughly the same as nvidias competing  ti the fury x comes close but cant quite stand up to nvidias card instead its in the middle of the market where amd excels retailing for around  the radeon r x occupies a niche between nvidias roughly  gtx  and the more than  gtx  the radeon r x outperforms the gtx  for just a few dollars more and while it cant quite match the gtx  its much less expensive the gtx  is quite a bit faster but also quite a bit more expensive then the r x  though still a bit of an overall spoiler like the r   while the r x will pass the gb gtx  albeit with a price premium of its own at this point its safe to say that amd holds a distinct edge on performance for the price as they often do though as has been the case all this generation they arent going to match nvidias power efficiency wrote ryan smith in his review for anandtech an almost  splitthe r x has only been on sale for a little more than a month so its hard to say whether it will help amd claw back significant share from nvidia over the last several years amd has lost a sizable share of the graphics card market to nvidia which now accounts for about  of the market in the third quarter amds market share rose slightly but only to  nvidia accounted for almost all of the remaining sales still amds graphics business remains intriguing especially on the eve of what could be a revolutionary technology both htc and facebook are set to launch virtual reality headsets aimed at pc gamers in the first half of  in order to take advantage wouldbe virtual reality users will need pcs equipped with powerful graphics cards unfortunately its not clear if the r x will be enough for those headsets but amd

marketing at fairchild had like many fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within that company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by  with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by  amd was producing  products – of which  were proprietary including the am a static nchannel bit ram and three lowpower schottky msi circuits amls amls and amls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit  in  by  amd entered the microprocessor market with the am a reverseengineered clone of the intel  and the am bitslice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in  it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with amd granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october  in  amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the us market siemens purchased  of amds stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving amd an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amds secondsource zilog z microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the us division in  amd closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late  after switching focus to manufacturing secondsource intel x microprocessors total sales in fiscal year  topped  million and in  amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in

antonio in  in  amd began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with inteledit intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in  in  ibm created its pc and wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips beginning in  amd began volumeproducing secondsource intellicensed    and  processors and by  its own am clone of intels  processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some success in the mids with the amd and amd world chip fsk modem one of the first multistandard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to  baud half duplex or  full duplex beginning in  amd embraced the perceived shift toward risc with their own amd am k processor the k survived as an embedded processor the company also increased its eprom memory market share in the late s throughout the s amd was a secondsource supplier of intel x processors in  it introduced its own compatible am an amddesigned chip creating its own chips amd began to compete directly with intel amd had a large and successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust in  to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from intel amd spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into spansion a joint venture with fujitsu which had been comanufacturing flash memory with amd since  amd divested itself of spansion in december  in order to focus on the microprocessor market and spansion went public in an ipo acquisition of atiedit amd announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company ati technologies on july   amd paid  billion in cash and  million shares of its stock for a total of approximately  billion the transaction completed on october   on august   amd announced that it would retire the ati brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd brand name in october  amd announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibilliondollar joint venture with advanced technology investment co an investment company formed by the government of abu dhabi the new venture is called globalfoundries inc the partnership and spinoff gave amd an infusion of cash and allowed amd to focus solely on chip design to assure the abu dhabi investors of the new ventures success ceo hector ruiz stepped down as ceo of amd in july  while remaining executive chairman in preparation for becoming chairman of global foundries in march  president and coo dirk meyer became amds ceo recessionary losses necessitated amd cutting  jobs in  in august  amd announced that former lenovo executive rory read would be joining the company as ceo replacing meyer amd announced in november  plans to lay off more than   of its employees from across all divisions worldwide in october  it announced plans to lay off an additional  of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue amd acquired the lowpower server manufacturer seamicro in early  with an eye to bringing out an arm architecture server chip on october   amd announced that rory read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer he was succeeded by lisa su a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since june on october   amd announced a new

main articles amd k amd k athlon duron and sempron amds first inhouse x processor was the k which was launched in  the k was a reference to kryptonite in comic books the only substance which could harm superman was kryptonite this is a reference to intels hegemony over the market ie an anthropomorphization of them as superman the numeral  refers to the fifth generation of x processors rival intel had previously introduced its line of fifthgeneration x processors as pentium because the us trademark and patent office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked in  amd purchased nexgen specifically for the rights to their nx series of xcompatible processors amd gave the nexgen design team their own building left them alone and gave them time and money to rework the nx the result was the k processor introduced in  although the k was based on socket  variants such as k were faster than intels pentium ii sixthgeneration processor the k was amds seventhgeneration x processor making its debut on june   under the brand name athlon unlike previous amd processors it could not be used on the same motherboards as intels due to licensing issues surrounding intels slot  connector and instead used a slot a connector referenced to the alpha processor bus the duron was a lowercost and limited version of the athlon kb instead of kb l cache in a pin socketed pga socket a or soldered directly onto the motherboard sempron was released as a lowercost athlon xp replacing duron in the socket a pga era it has since been migrated upward to all new sockets up to am on october   the athlon xp was released on february   the athlon xp with kb l cache was released athlon  opteron and phenomedit main articles athlon  opteron and phenom processor the k was a major revision of the k architecture with the most notable features being the addition of a bit extension to the x instruction set called x amd or x the incorporation of an onchip memory controller and the implementation of an extremely high performance pointtopoint interconnect called hypertransport as part of the direct connect architecture the technology was initially launched as the opteron serveroriented processor on april   shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop pcs branded athlon  on april   amd released the first dual core opteron an xbased server cpu a month later amd released the athlon  x the first desktopbased dual core processor family in may  amd abandoned the string  in its dualcore desktop product branding becoming athlon x downplaying the significance of bit computing in its processors further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dualcore desktop systems in  amd started to release dualcore sempron processors exclusively in china branded as the sempron  series with lower hypertransport speed and smaller l cache thus amd completed its dualcore product portfolio for each market segment after k came k in september  amd released the first k processors third generation opteron processors followed in november by the phenom processor for desktop k processors came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore versions with all cores on a single die amd released a new platform codenamed spider which utilized the new phenom processor as well as an r gpu and a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series however amd built the spider at nm which was uncompetitive with intels smaller and more powerefficient nm in january  amd released a new processor line dubbed phenom ii a refresh of the original phenom built using the  nm process amds new platform codenamed “dragon” utilized the new phenom ii processor and an ati r gpu from the r gpu family as well as a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series the phenom ii came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore variants all using the same die with cores disabled for the triplecore and dualcore versions the phenom ii resolved issues that the original phenom had including a low clock speed a small l cache and a coolnquiet bug that decreased performance the phenom ii cost less but was not performancecompetitive with intels midtohighrange core  quads the phenom ii also enhanced the phenoms memory controller allowing it to use ddr in a new native socket am while maintaining backwards compatibility with am the socket used for the phenom and allowing the use of the ddr memory that was used with the platform in april  amd released a new phenom ii hexacore core processor codenamed thuban this was a totally new die based on the hexacore “istanbul” opteron processor it included amds “turbo core” technology which allows the processor to automatically switch from  cores to  faster cores when more pure speed is needed the magny cours and lisbon server parts were released in  the magny cours part came in  to  cores and the lisbon part in  and  core parts magny cours is focused on performance while the lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt magny cours is an mcm multichip module with two hexacore “istanbul” opteron parts this will use a new g socket for dual and

processors both will be built on a  nm soi process fusion becomes the amd apuedit main articles amd apu and amd mobile platform following amds  acquisition of canadian graphics company ati technologies an initiative codenamed fusion was announced to integrate a cpu and gpu together on some of amds microprocessors including a built in pci express link to accommodate separate pci express peripherals eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard the initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the cpu eg floatingpoint unit operations to the gpu which is better optimized for some calculations the fusion was later renamed to the amd apu accelerated processing unit llano was amds first apu built for laptops llano was the second apu released targeted at the mainstream market incorporating a cpu and gpu on the same die as well as northbridge functions and using socket fm with ddr memory the cpu part of the processor was based on the phenom ii deneb

amd pursued a strategy of collaboration with other semiconductor manufacturers ibm and motorola to codevelop production technologies amds founder jerry sanders termed this the virtual gorilla strategy to compete with intels significantly greater investments in fabrication in  amd spun off its chip foundries into an independent company named globalfoundries this breakup of the company was attributed to the increasing costs of each process node the emirate of abu dhabi purchased the newly created company through its subsidiary advanced technology investment company atic purchasing the final stake from amd in  with the spinoff of its foundries amd became a fabless semiconductor manufacturer designing products to be produced at forhire foundries part of the globalfoundries spinoff included an agreement with amd to produce some number of products at globalfoundries both prior to the spinoff and after amd has pursued production with other foundries including tsmc and samsung it has been argued that argued this would reduce risk for amd by decreasing dependence on any one foundry which has caused issues in the past corporate affairsedit partnershipsedit amd utilizes strategic industry

first twelve yearsedit advanced micro devices was formally incorporated on may   by jerry sanders along with seven of his colleagues from fairchild semiconductor sanders an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at fairchild had like many fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within that company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by  with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by  amd was producing  products – of which  were proprietary including the am a static nchannel bit ram and three lowpower schottky msi circuits amls amls and amls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit  in  by  amd entered the microprocessor market with the am a reverseengineered clone of the intel  and the am bitslice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in  it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with amd granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october  in  amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the us market siemens purchased  of amds stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving amd an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amds secondsource zilog z microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the us division in  amd closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late  after switching focus to manufacturing secondsource intel x microprocessors total sales in fiscal year  topped  million and in  amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in  production also began in amds new semiconductor fab in austin texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in penang and manila and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in san antonio in  in  amd began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with inteledit intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in  in  ibm created its pc and wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips beginning in  amd began volumeproducing secondsource intellicensed    and  processors and by  its own am clone of intels  processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some success in the mids with the amd and amd world chip fsk modem one of the first multistandard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to  baud half duplex or  full duplex beginning in  amd embraced the perceived shift toward risc with their own amd am k processor the k survived as an embedded processor the company also increased its eprom memory market share in the late s throughout the s amd was a secondsource supplier of intel x processors in  it introduced its own compatible am an amddesigned chip creating its own chips amd began to compete directly with intel amd had a large and successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust in  to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from intel amd spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into spansion a joint venture with fujitsu which had been comanufacturing flash memory with amd since  amd divested itself of spansion in december  in order to focus on the microprocessor market and spansion went public in an ipo acquisition of atiedit amd announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company ati technologies on july   amd paid  billion in cash and  million shares of its stock for a total of approximately  billion the transaction completed on october   on august   amd announced that it would retire the ati brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd brand name in october  amd announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibilliondollar joint venture with advanced technology investment co an investment company formed by the government of abu dhabi the new venture is called globalfoundries inc the partnership and spinoff gave amd an infusion of cash and allowed amd to focus solely on chip design to assure the abu dhabi investors of the new ventures success ceo hector ruiz stepped down as ceo of amd in july  while remaining executive chairman in preparation for becoming chairman of global foundries in march  president and coo dirk meyer became amds ceo recessionary losses necessitated amd cutting  jobs in  in august  amd announced that former lenovo executive rory read would be joining the company as ceo replacing meyer amd announced in november  plans to lay off more than   of its employees from across all divisions worldwide in october  it announced plans to lay off an additional  of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue amd acquired the lowpower server manufacturer seamicro in early  with an eye to bringing out an arm architecture server chip on october   amd announced that rory read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer he was succeeded by lisa su a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since june on october   amd announced a new restructuring plan along with its q results effective july   amd reorganized into two business groups computing and graphics which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets discrete gpus and professional graphics and enterprise embedded and semicustom which primarily includes server and embedded processors dense servers semicustom soc products including solutions for

manufacturer of  and  processors ibm wanted to use the intel  in its ibm pc but ibms policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips amd later produced the am under the same arrangement in  intel in order to shore up its advantage in the marketplace internally decided to no longer cooperate with amd in supplying product information and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the intel  to amd in  amd invoked arbitration over the issue and intel reacted by cancelling the  technologicalexchange agreement altogether after three years of testimony amd eventually won in arbitration in  but intel disputed this decision another long legal dispute followed ending in  when the supreme court of california sided with the arbitrator and amd in  intel also countersued amd renegotiating amds right to use derivatives of intels microcode for its cloned processors in the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute amd was forced to develop cleanroom designed versions of intel code for its x and x processors the former long after intel had released its own x in  in march  amd released the am its clone of the intel  processor by october of the same year it had sold one million units in  amd introduced the first of the am family of processors which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers including compaq which signed an exclusive agreement using the am another ambased processor the amx was released in november  and continued amds success as a fast costeffective processor finally in an agreement effective  amd received the rights to the microcode in intels x and x processor families but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors k k athlon duron and sempronedit main articles amd k amd k athlon duron and sempron amds first inhouse x processor was the k which was launched in  the k was a reference to kryptonite in comic books the only substance which could harm superman was kryptonite this is a reference to intels hegemony over the market ie an anthropomorphization of them as superman the numeral  refers to the fifth generation of x processors rival intel had previously introduced its line of fifthgeneration x processors as pentium because the us trademark and patent office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked in  amd purchased nexgen specifically for the rights to their nx series of xcompatible processors amd gave the nexgen design team their own building left them alone and gave them time and money to rework the nx the result was the k processor introduced in  although the k was based on socket  variants such as k were faster than intels pentium ii sixthgeneration processor the k was amds seventhgeneration x processor making its debut on june   under the brand name athlon unlike previous amd processors it could not be used on the same motherboards as intels due to licensing issues surrounding intels slot  connector and instead used a slot a connector referenced to the alpha processor bus the duron was a lowercost and limited version of the athlon kb instead of kb l cache in a pin socketed pga socket a or soldered directly onto the motherboard sempron was released as a lowercost athlon xp replacing duron in the socket a pga era it has since been migrated upward to all new sockets up to am on october   the athlon xp was released on february   the athlon xp with kb l cache was released athlon  opteron and phenomedit main articles athlon  opteron and phenom processor the k was a major revision of the k architecture with the most notable features being the addition of a bit extension to the x instruction set called x amd or x the incorporation of an onchip memory controller and the implementation of an extremely high performance pointtopoint interconnect called hypertransport as part of the direct connect architecture the technology was initially launched as the opteron serveroriented processor on april   shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop pcs branded athlon  on april   amd released the first dual core opteron an xbased server cpu a month later amd released the athlon  x the first desktopbased dual core processor family in may  amd abandoned the string  in its dualcore desktop product branding becoming athlon x downplaying the significance of bit computing in its processors further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dualcore desktop systems in  amd started to release dualcore sempron processors exclusively in china branded as the sempron  series with lower hypertransport speed and smaller l cache thus amd completed its dualcore product portfolio for each market segment after k came k in september  amd released the first k processors third generation opteron processors followed in november by the phenom processor for desktop k processors came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore versions with all cores on a single die amd released a new platform codenamed spider which utilized the new phenom processor as well as an r gpu and a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series however amd built the spider at nm which was uncompetitive with intels smaller and more powerefficient nm in january  amd released a new processor line dubbed phenom ii a refresh of the original phenom built using the  nm process amds new platform codenamed “dragon” utilized the new phenom ii processor and an ati r gpu from the r gpu family as well as a  gxfx chipset from the amd  chipset series the phenom ii came in dualcore triplecore and quadcore variants all using the same die with cores disabled for the triplecore and dualcore versions the phenom ii resolved issues that the original phenom had including a low clock speed a small l cache and a coolnquiet bug that decreased performance the phenom ii cost less but was not performancecompetitive with intels midtohighrange core  quads the phenom ii also enhanced the phenoms memory controller allowing it to use ddr in a new native socket am while maintaining backwards compatibility with am the socket used for the phenom and allowing the use of the ddr memory that was used with the platform in april  amd released a new phenom ii hexacore core processor codenamed thuban this was a totally new die based on the hexacore “istanbul” opteron processor it included amds “turbo core” technology which allows the processor to automatically switch from  cores to  faster cores when more pure speed is needed the magny cours and lisbon server parts were released in  the magny cours part came in  to  cores and the lisbon part in  and  core parts magny cours is focused on performance while the lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt magny cours is an mcm multichip module with two hexacore “istanbul” opteron parts this will use a new g socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as opteron xx series processors lisbon uses c socket certified for dual socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as opteron xx processors both will be built on a  nm soi process fusion becomes the amd apuedit main articles amd apu and amd mobile platform following amds  acquisition of canadian graphics company ati technologies an initiative codenamed fusion was announced to integrate a cpu and gpu together on some of amds microprocessors including a built in pci express link to accommodate separate pci express peripherals eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard the initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the cpu eg floatingpoint unit operations to the gpu which is better optimized for some calculations the fusion was later renamed to the amd apu accelerated processing unit llano was amds first apu built for laptops llano was the second apu released targeted at the mainstream market incorporating a cpu and gpu on the same die as well as northbridge functions and using socket fm with ddr memory the cpu part of the processor was based on the phenom ii deneb

product and server product the initial server product was announced at the opteron a in  and core cortexa based armva soc and was expected to be followed by an apu incorporating a graphic core next gpu however the opteron a was not released until  with the delay attributed to adding software support the a was also criticed for not having support from major vendors upon its release in  amd also announced the k custom core for release in  while being armva instruction set architecture compliant the k is expected to be entirely custom designed targeting server embedded and semicustom markets the k was subsequently delayed until  in preference to the development of amds x based zen microarchitecture zen based cpus and apusedit main article zen microarchitecture zen is a new architecture

one of amds primary goals with zen was an ipc increase of at least  however recently amd announced that they had actually achieved a  increase processors made on the zen architecture are built on the  nm finfet node and have a renewed focus on singlecore performance and hsa compatibility previous processors from amd were either built in the  nm process bulldozer and piledriver cpus or the  nm process steamroller and excavator apus because of this zen is much more energy efficient the zen architecture is the first to encompass cpus and apus from amd built for a single socket socket am also new for this architecture is the implementation of simultaneous multithreading smt technology something intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary hyperthreading implementation of smt this is a departure from the clustered multithreading design introduced with the bulldozer architecture zen also has support for ddr memory amd released the zen based highend

technology groupedit in september  amd separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the radeon technology group rtg headed by raja koduri this gave the graphics division of amd autonomy in product design and marketing the rtg then went on to create and release the polaris and vega microarchitectures released in  and  respectively in particular the vega or th generation gcn microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities semicustom and game console productsedit in  amds then ceo rory read began a program to offer semicustom designs rather than amd simply designing and offering a single product potential customers could work with amd to design a custom chip based on amds intellectual property customers pay a nonrecurring engineering fees for design and development and a purchase price for the resulting semicustom products in particular amd noted their unique position of offering both x and graphics intellectual property these semicustom designs would have design wins as the apus in the playstation  and xbox one and the subsequent playstation  pro xbox one s and xbox one x financially these semicustom products would represent a majority of the companys revenue in  other hardwareedit amd motherboard chipsetsedit see also comparison of amd chipsets before the launch of athlon  processors in  amd designed chipsets for their processors spanning the k and k processor generations the chipsets include the amd amd and the amd chipsets the situation changed in  with the release of athlon  processors and amd chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets this was the “open platform management architecture” with ati via and sis developing their own chipset for athlon  processors and later athlon  x and athlon  fx processors including the quad fx platform chipset from nvidia the initiative went further with the release of opteron server processors as amd stopped the design of server chipsets in  after releasing the amd chipset and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for opteron processors as of today nvidia and broadcom are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for opteron processors as the company completed the acquisition of ati technologies in  the firm gained the ati design team for chipsets which previously designed the radeon xpress  and the radeon xpress  chipsets amd then renamed the chipsets for amd processors under amd branding for instance the crossfire xpress  chipset was renamed as amd x crossfire chipset in february  amd announced the first amdbranded chipset since  with the release of the amd g chipset previously under the development codename rs targeted at mainstream igp computing it was the industrys first to implement a hdmi  port on motherboards shipping for more than a million units while ati had aimed at releasing an intel igp chipset the plan was scrapped and the inventories of radeon xpress  codenamed rs sold under ati brand was sold to two oems abit and asrock although amd stated the firm would still produce intel chipsets intel had not granted the license of  mhz fsb to ati on november   amd announced a new chipset series portfolio the amd series chipsets covering

first twelve yearsedit advanced micro devices was formally incorporated on may   by jerry sanders along with seven of his colleagues from fairchild semiconductor sanders an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at fairchild had like many fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within that company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in  at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july  in september  amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure a customer base amd initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers the telecommunications industry and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid in november  the company manufactured its first product the am a bit msi shift register which began selling in  also in  amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its bestselling product in  was the am the fastest multiplier available in  amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am a bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the companys total annual sales reached  million amd went public in september  the company was a second source for intel moslsi circuits by  with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by  amd was producing  products – of which  were proprietary including the am a static nchannel bit ram and three lowpower schottky msi circuits amls amls and amls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit  in  by  amd entered the microprocessor market with the am a reverseengineered clone of the intel  and the am bitslice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in  it entered into a crosslicensing agreement with amd granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october  in  amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the us market siemens purchased  of amds stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving amd an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amds secondsource zilog z microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the us division in  amd closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late  after switching focus to manufacturing secondsource intel x microprocessors total sales in fiscal year  topped  million and in  amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in  production also began in amds new semiconductor fab in austin texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in penang and manila and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in san antonio in  in  amd began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with inteledit intel had introduced the first x microprocessors in  in  ibm created its pc and wanted intels x processors but only under the condition that intel also provide a secondsource manufacturer for its patented x microprocessors intel and amd entered into a year technology exchange agreement first signed in october  and formally executed in february  the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a secondsource manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company the  agreement also extended the  amd–intel crosslicensing agreement through  the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one years notice the main result of the  agreement was that amd became a secondsource manufacturer of intels x microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its   and  chips beginning in  amd began volumeproducing secondsource intellicensed    and  processors and by  its own am clone of intels  processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in  it introduced intstd the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the worlds first k eprom in  that year amd was listed in the book the  best companies to work for in america and based on  income it made the fortune  list for the first time in  by mid however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to longterm aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and noninnovative chip market in the us amd rode out the mids crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for  weeks in fiscal year  and by heavily lobbying the us government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing during this time period amd withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips amd had some success in the mids with the amd and amd world chip fsk modem one of the first multistandard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to  baud half duplex or  full duplex beginning in  amd embraced the perceived shift toward risc with their own amd am k processor the k survived as an embedded processor the company also increased its eprom memory market share in the late s throughout the s amd was a secondsource supplier of intel x processors in  it introduced its own compatible am an amddesigned chip creating its own chips amd began to compete directly with intel amd had a large and successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust in  to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from intel amd spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into spansion a joint venture with fujitsu which had

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
