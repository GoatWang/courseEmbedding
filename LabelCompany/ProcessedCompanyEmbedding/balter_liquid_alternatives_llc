managers and expertise in evaluating managers and investment opportunities to provide family offices high net worth individuals and institutions with thoughtful and dynamic customized solutions to achieve their investment goals how we view the alternative investment landscape less liquid less transparency more complex strategies more liquid greater transparency more simplistic strategies private equity hedge fund liquid alternatives our views on the alternative investment landscape are based on liquidity transparency and complexity we examine these factors before making the most appropriate investment choices for our clients firm philosophy we are focused purely on hedge fund research and investing with both pooled and uniquely tailored offerings our dedicated focus on hedge funds and liquid alternatives provides us with the highest level of insight and differentiation by applying our rigorous approach to sourcing analyzing monitoring and interacting with both investment and operations personnel at a given firm we utilize both established funds as well as continuously sourcing nonbrand name managers that have not yet been identified by the broader investment community bcm’s clients all share the desire for a differentiated approach to hedge fund investing we utilize both established funds as well as continuously sourcing “nonbrand name” managers that have not yet been identified by the broader investment community we stand by the following investment and management philosophies we remain committed to providing the highest standard of work service and understanding of client needs right sized funds assets under management of any given fund and strategy is highly relevant to the selection process while bcm does not maintain strict parameters on fund size we favor funds that manage an appropriate amount of capital for their strategy so that they can invest in size or timerestrictive opportunities where larger funds would find their capital sizing precludes them from investing research has repeatedly shown that managers can generate better risk adjusted returns with a smaller capital base operational integrity when assessing a fund or firm operational integrity will always supersede performance we meticulously analyze the operations and organizational structure for all hedge funds we invest with prior to committing capital we do not utilize a “check the box” approach to operational due diligence as we believe that for each given fund’s strategy and asset size there are operational best practices that must be followed to mitigate business risk for a hedge fund investment bcm also employs proprietary measures designed to identify potential operational failures that are often overlooked and are the result of our years of industry experience challenge the status quo many industry participants have taken a passive approach to hedge fund investing bcm believes that hedge funds require an active approach to identify the right manager over time extensive and ongoing diligence on both existing and potential hedge fund investments allows us to maximize potential returns for our client base we do not accept the status quo for industry fees liquidity terms or transparency weve learned from experience that there is a negative correlation with a funds assets under management and its returns by challenging the industry

volatility in  alternative addressing market volatility in   tripp zimmerman  associate director of research tweet share feedback regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out or underperform market capweighted indexes over long periods we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles partly by tilting toward known return premiums in  value and size ie small caps underperformed but momentum quality and low volatility outperformed now the question is what factors will perform best in  and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market wisdomtree recently created the wisdomtree dynamic longshort us equity index wtdls designed to generate alpha at the core with a multifactor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically key features to wisdomtree approach wisdomtree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade typically focusing on signal factors such as value quality and size but now we are pleased to introduce this new multifactor approach the wisdomtree dynamic long us equity index wtdl is the long component of wtdls and comprises approximately  stocks with the highest combined fundamentals which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly • fundamental selection stocks are graded on a combination of growth quality and value factors and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion it is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another by combining quality and value factors which we believe complement each other we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term while still tapping into the longterm return premiums   • lowvolatility weighting in each sector the index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market we know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor so we believe applying it to a multifactor selection model will also add value   • sectorneutral capping the index targets a sectorneutral allocation when compared to the largest  us stocks by market capitalization we believe this keeps the index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or lowvolatility weighting to significantly over or underweight certain sectors we are confident about the stock selection and weighting process so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a capweighted index to get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process we compared wtdl against popular market capweighted style and factor indexes   index valuations for definitions of terms and indexes in the chart visit our glossary   • attractive
