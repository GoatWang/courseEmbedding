misleading investors in offerings of residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs the firm agreed to a settlement in which it will pay  million the sec plans to distribute the money to harmed investors the sec alleges that jp morgan misstated information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans that provided collateral for an rmbs offering in which it was the underwriter jp morgan received fees of more than  million and investors sustained losses of at least  million on undisclosed delinquent loans jp morgan also is charged for bear stearns failure to disclose its practice of obtaining and keeping cash settlements from mortgage loan originators on problem loans that bear stearns had sold into rmbs trusts the proceeds from this bulk settlement practice were at least  million according to the secs complaint against jp morgan filed in federal court in washington dc federal regulations under the securities laws require the disclosure of delinquency information related to assets that provide collateral for an assetbacked securities offering information about the delinquency status of mortgage loans in an rmbs transaction is important to investors because those loans are the primary source of funds by which investors can earn interest and obtain repayment of their principal the sec alleges that in the prospectus supplement for the  billion rmbs offering that occurred in december  jp morgan made materially false and misleading statements about the loans that provided collateral for the transaction the firm represented that only four loans  percent of the total loans collateralizing the transaction were delinquent by  to  days and that those four were the only loans that had had an instance of delinquency of  or more days in the  months prior to the cutoff date for the transaction however at the time jp morgan made these representations the firm actually had information showing that more than  loans above  percent of the total loans collateralizing the transaction were and had been  to  days delinquent and the four loans represented as being  to  days delinquent were in fact  to  days delinquent the secs complaint also alleges that bear stearns bulk settlements covered loans collateralizing  different rmbs transactions issued from  to  loan originators were usually required by contract to buy back loans that suffered early payment defaults or had other defects however bear stearns frequently negotiated discounted cash settlements with these loan originators in lieu of a buyback on loans that were owned by the rmbs trusts the firm  both before and after the merger with jp morgan  then kept most of the bulk settlement proceeds the firm failed to disclose the practice to investors who owned the loans bear stearns repurchased only about  percent of these defective bulk settlement loans from the trusts compared to a nearly  percent repurchase rate when loan originators agreed to buy back the defective loans for most loans covered by bulk settlements the firm collected money from originators without paying anything to the trusts jp morgan and jp morgan acceptance corporation i settled the secs charges by

mounted in those markets in  and  the company actually increased its exposure especially the mortgagebacked assets that were central to the subprime mortgage crisis in march  the federal reserve bank

april  issue of institutional investor magazine bear stearns was the seventhlargest securities firm in terms of total capital a year later bear stearns had notional contract amounts of approximately  trillion in derivative financial instruments of which  trillion were listed futures and option contracts in addition bear stearns was carrying more than  billion in level  assets on its books at the end of fiscal  versus a net equity position of only  billion this  billion supported  billion in assets which means a leverage ratio of  to  this highly leveraged balance sheet consisting of many illiquid and potentially worthless assets led to the rapid diminution of investor and lender confidence which finally evaporated as bear was forced to call the new york federal reserve to stave off the looming cascade of counterparty risk which would ensue from forced liquidation start of the crisis – two subprime mortgage funds failedit main article  subprime mortgage financial crisis see also subprime lending and collateralized debt obligation on june   bear stearns pledged a collateralized loan of up to  billion to bail out one of its funds the bear stearns highgrade structured credit fund while negotiating with other banks to loan money against collateral to another fund the bear stearns highgrade structured credit enhanced leveraged fund bear stearns had originally put up just  million so they were hesitant about the bailout nonetheless ceo james cayne and other senior executives worried about the damage to the companys reputation the funds were invested in thinly traded collateralized debt obligations cdos merrill lynch seized  million worth of the underlying collateral but only was able to auction  million of them the incident sparked concern of contagion as bear stearns might be forced to liquidate its cdos prompting a markdown of similar assets in other portfolios richard a marin a senior executive at bear stearns asset management responsible for the two hedge funds was replaced on june  by jeffrey b lane a former vice chairman of rival investment bank lehman brothers during the week of july   bear stearns disclosed that the two subprime hedge funds had lost nearly all of their value amid a rapid decline in the market for subprime mortgages on august   investors in the two funds took action against bear stearns and its top board and risk management managers and officers the law firms of jake zamansky  associates and rich  intelisano both filed arbitration claims with the national association of securities dealers alleging that bear stearns misled investors about its exposure to the funds this was the first legal action made against bear stearns copresident warren spector was asked to resign on august   as a result of the collapse of two hedge funds tied to subprime mortgages a september  report in the new york times noted that bear stearns posted a  percent drop in net profits due to their hedge fund losses with samuel molinaros november  revelation that bear stearns was writing down a further  billion in mortgagerelated securities and would face its first loss in  years standard  poors downgraded the companys credit rating from aa to a matthew tannin and ralph r cioffi both former managers of hedge funds at bear stearns companies were arrested june   they faced criminal charges and were found not guilty of misleading investors about the risks involved in the subprime market tannin and cioffi have also been named in lawsuits brought by barclays bank which claims they were one of the many investors misled by the executives they were also named in civil lawsuits brought in  by investors including barclays bank who claimed they had been misled barclays claimed that bear stearns knew that certain assets in the bear stearns highgrade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage master fund were worth much less than their professed values the suit claimed that bear stearns managers devised a plan to make more money for themselves and further to use the enhanced fund as a repository for risky poorquality investments the lawsuit said bear stearns told barclays that the enhanced fund was up almost  through june —when in reality the portfolios asset values were plummeting other investors in the fund included jeffrey e epsteins financial trust company fed bailout and sale to jpmorgan chaseedit on march   the federal reserve bank of new york agreed to provide a  billion loan to bear stearns collateralized by free and clear assets from bear stearns in order to provide bear stearns the liquidity for up to  days that the market was refusing to provide shortly thereafter the federal reserve bank of new york had a change of heart and told bear stearns that the day loan was unavailable to them the deal was then changed to where the ny fed would create a company to buy  billion worth of bear stearns assets two days later on march   bear stearns signed a merger agreement with jp morgan chase in a stock swap worth  a share or less than  percent of bear stearns market value just two days before this sale price represented a staggering loss as its stock had traded at  a share as late as january  and  a share as late as february  the new company is funded by loans of  billion from the new york frb and  billion from jp morgan chase the junior loan with no further recourse to jp morgan chase this nonrecourse loan means that the loan is collateralized by mortgage debt and that the government cannot seize jp morgan chases assets if the mortgage debt collateral becomes insufficient to repay the loan chairman of the fed ben bernanke defended the bailout by stating that a bankruptcy of bear stearns would have affected the real economy and could have caused a chaotic unwinding of investments across the us markets on march  securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox said the collapse of bear stearns was due to a lack of confidence not a lack of capital cox noted that bear stearnss problems escalated when rumors spread about its liquidity crisis which in turn eroded investor confidence in the firm notwithstanding that bear stearns continued to have high quality collateral to provide as security for borrowings market counterparties became less willing to enter into collateralized funding arrangements with bear stearns said cox bear stearns liquidity pool started at  billion on march  and then plummeted to  billion on march  ultimately market rumors about bear stearns difficulties became selffulfilling cox said on march   a class action was filed on behalf of shareholders challenging the terms of jpmorgan’s recently announced acquisition of bear stearns that same day a new agreement was reached that raised jpmorgan chases offer to  a share up from the initial  offer which meant an offer of  billion the revised deal was aimed to quiet upset investors and any subsequent legal action brought against jp morgan chase as a result of the deal as well as to prevent employees many of whose past compensation consisted of bear stearns stock from leaving for other firms the bear stearns bailout was seen as an extremecase scenario and continues to raise significant questions about fed intervention on april   paul a volcker stated that the fed has taken actions that extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers see his remarks at a luncheon of the economic club of new york on may  bear stearns shareholders approved the sale to jpmorgan chase at the pershare price an article by journalist matt taibbi

federal reserve bank of new york had a change of heart and told bear stearns that the day loan was unavailable to them the deal was then changed to where the ny fed would create a company to buy  billion worth of bear stearns assets two days later on march   bear stearns signed a merger agreement with jp morgan chase in a stock swap worth  a share or less than  percent of bear stearns market

 billion from the new york frb and  billion from jp morgan chase the junior loan with no further recourse to jp morgan chase this nonrecourse loan means that the loan is collateralized by mortgage

stating that a bankruptcy of bear stearns would have affected the real economy and could have caused a chaotic unwinding of investments across the us markets on march  securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox said the collapse of bear stearns was due to a lack of confidence not a lack of capital cox noted that bear stearnss problems escalated when rumors spread about its liquidity crisis which in turn eroded investor confidence in the firm notwithstanding that bear stearns continued to have high quality collateral to provide as security for borrowings market counterparties became less willing to enter into collateralized funding arrangements with bear stearns said cox bear stearns liquidity pool started at  billion on march  and then plummeted to  billion on march  ultimately market rumors about bear stearns difficulties became selffulfilling cox said on march   a class action was filed on behalf of shareholders challenging the terms of jpmorgan’s recently announced acquisition of bear stearns that same day a new agreement was reached that raised jpmorgan chases offer to  a share up from the initial  offer which meant an offer of  billion the revised deal was aimed to quiet upset investors and any subsequent legal action brought against jp morgan chase as a result of the deal as well as to prevent employees many of whose past compensation

 billion from the new york frb and  billion from jp morgan chase the junior loan with no further recourse to jp morgan chase this nonrecourse loan means that the loan is collateralized by mortgage debt and that the government cannot seize jp morgan chases assets if the mortgage debt collateral becomes insufficient to repay the loan chairman of the fed ben bernanke defended the bailout by stating that a bankruptcy of bear stearns would have affected the real economy and could have caused a chaotic unwinding of investments across the us markets on march  securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox said the collapse of bear stearns was due to a lack of confidence not a lack of capital cox noted that bear stearnss problems escalated when rumors spread about its liquidity crisis which in turn eroded investor confidence in the firm notwithstanding that bear stearns continued to have high quality collateral to provide as security for borrowings market counterparties became less willing to enter into collateralized funding arrangements with bear stearns said cox bear stearns liquidity pool started at  billion on march  and then plummeted to  billion on march  ultimately market rumors about bear stearns difficulties became selffulfilling cox said on march   a class action was filed on behalf of shareholders challenging the terms of jpmorgan’s recently announced acquisition of bear stearns that same day a new agreement was reached that raised jpmorgan chases offer to  a share up from the initial  offer which meant an offer of  billion the revised deal was aimed to quiet upset investors and any subsequent legal action brought against jp morgan chase as a result of the deal as well as to prevent employees many of whose past compensation consisted of bear stearns stock from leaving for other firms the bear stearns bailout was seen as an extremecase scenario and continues to raise significant questions about fed intervention on april

the largest securities firms in the country with reported total consolidated assets of nearly  billion bear stearns engaged in a broad range of activities including investment banking securities and derivatives trading and clearing brokerage services and originating and securitizing commercial and residential mortgage loans financial conditions for the firm deteriorated markedly between midjanuary and midmarch  on march   bear stearns notified the federal reserve that it expected that it would not have enough funding or liquid assets to meet its financial obligations the following day and would not be able to find a privatesector source of alternative financing the imminent insolvency of bear stearns the large presence of bear stearns in several important financial markets including in particular the markets for repostyle transactions overthecounter derivative and foreign exchange transactions mortgagebacked securities and securities clearing services and the potential for contagion to similarly situated firms raised significant concern that the stability of financial markets would be seriously disrupted if bear stearns were suddenly unable to meet its obligations to counterparties and the extension of credit allowed for an orderly resolution of the firm bridge loan to address the immediate liquidity needs of bear stearns and forestall the potential systemic disruptions that a default or bankruptcy of the company would have caused in the already stressed credit markets on friday march   the federal reserve board authorized the federal reserve bank of new york frbny to extend credit to bear stearns through jpmorgan chase bank na jpmc bank the purpose of this bridge loan was to ensure that bear stearns would meet its obligations as they came due that day allowing for time during the weekend for bear stearns to explore options with other financial institutions that might enable it to avoid bankruptcy and for policymakers to continue to seek ways to contain the risk to financial markets in the event no privatesector solution proved possible the loan to bear stearns was in the amount of  billion and was secured by assets of bear stearns with a value of  billion the rate of interest on this loan was the rate for primary credit the frbny received no warrantsor any other potential equity of either jpmc bank or bear stearns in exchange for the loan and the loan was made without recourse to jpmc bank on the morning of monday march  the  billion was repaid in full to the frbny with interest of nearly  million the bridge loan was extended under the authority of section  of the federal reserve act which permitted the board in unusual and exigent circumstances to authorize reserve banks to extend credit to individuals partnerships and corporations maiden lane llc despite the receipt by bear stearns of federal reserve funding through a bridge loan on march   market pressures on bear stearns worsened that day and during the weekend bear stearns likely would have been unable to avoid bankruptcy on monday march  without either very large injections of liquidity from the federal reserve or an acquisition by a stronger firm jpmorgan chase and co jpmc emerged as the only viable bidder for bear stearns and on sunday march  bear stearns accepted an offer to merge with jpmc however jpmc was concerned about its ability to absorb a portion of bear stearns mortgage trading portfolio given the uncertainty about the scale of potential losses facing the financial system at the time and strained credit markets to facilitate a prompt acquisition of bear stearns by jpmc the frbny created a limited liability company maiden lane llc to acquire that set of assets of bear stearns the frbny extended credit to the llc which would then manage those assets through time to maximize the repayment of credit extended to the llc and to minimize disruption to financial markets maiden lane llc purchased approximately  billion in assets from bear stearns with a loan of approximately  billion from the frbny under the terms of the agreement jpmc also lent roughly  billion to maiden lane in a loan that is subordinated to the loan from the frbny for repayment purposes the interest rate on the loan extended by the frbny is the primary credit rate and the interest rate on thesubordinated loan is the primary credit rate plus  basis points payments from the proceeds from the assets held by the llc are to be used in the following order operating expenses of the llc principal due to the frbny interest due to the frbny principal due to jpmc and interest due to jpmc any remaining funds will be paid to the frbny details on the terms of the loan to maiden lane llc are available on the frbny website the loan to maiden lane llc loan was

navigation toggle navigation practice area securities litigation  investor protection bear stearns mortgage passthrough certificates litigation on august   judge laura taylor swain of the united states district court for the southern district of new york issued an order approving the distribution of net settlement proceeds to class members in in re bear stearns mortgage passthrough certificates litigation case no cvlts sdny this order came after the court issued an order and final judgment on may   granting final approval to a settlement in which jp morgan chase  co which had purchased bear stearns in  agreed to pay  million in cash plus up to  million in expenses to investors led by a group of pension funds the claims against bear stearns arose from its sale of  billion worth of mortgagebacked securities that proved defective during the recent us housing and financial crises  the settlement finally resolves claims that bear stearns violated federal securities laws by selling certificates backed by approximately  largely “alta” mortgages in  offerings from may  to april  investors alleged that the offering documents contained false and misleading statements about the underwriting guidelines used by bear stearns’ emc mortgage unit countrywide home loans and other lenders and the accuracy of associated property appraisals appointed lead counsel in december  cohen milstein represents colead plaintiffs the new jersey carpenters health fund the oregon public employees retirement system and the iowa public employees retirement system the defendants named in the lawsuit include structured asset mortgage investments ii inc “sami” and bear stearns assetbacked securities i llc “bsabsi” certain of their officers and directors bear stearns cos inc “bsc” jp morgan chase inc “jpm” as successor in interest to bsc the underwriter of the certificates bear stearns  co inc the issuers of the certificates and the ratings agencies who rated the certificates case background this class action securities lawsuit was brought on behalf of purchasers of mortgage passthrough certificates issued by sami andor bsabsi the “certificates” pursuant andor traceable to false and misleading registration statements and prospectus supplements issued between march  and september  collectively the “registration statements” the lawsuit alleged that the registration statements and prospectuses incorporated therein contained material misstatements and omissions in violation of sections   and  of the securities act of  the certificates were supported by large pools of mortgage loans generally secured by first liens on residential properties including conventional adjustable rate and negative amortization mortgage loans according to the pleadings the registration statements included false statements andor omissions about i the underwriting standards purportedly used in connection with the origination of the underlying mortgage loans ii the maximum loantovalue ratios used to qualify borrowers iii the appraisals of properties underlying the mortgage loans and iv the debttoincome ratios permitted on the loans as a result of these misstatements and omissions the certificates were secured by assets that had a much greater risk profile than represented in the registration statement and the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations the “nrsros” or “ratings agencies” assigned superior credit ratings to the certificates as a result of defendants’ failure to disclose the underwriting defects and appraisal manipulations however by late  the amount of uncollectible mortgage loans securing the certificates began to be revealed to the public and the rating agencies began to put negative watch labels on many certificate classes ultimately downgrading many the delinquency and foreclosure rates of the mortgage loans securing the certificates had grown both faster and in greater quantity than what would be expected for mortgage loans of the types described in the prospectus supplements as a result the certificates had declined precipitously in value this class action posed several substantial challenges to obtaining relief for the class for instance lead counsel had to file a motion for leave to amend the thencurrent complaint and oppose defendants’ motions for reconsideration based on changing law in the second circuit in particular lead counsel had to adapt to new rulings in necaibew health  welfare fund v goldman sachs  co  fd  d cir  which significantly altered the law on issues of standing and police and fire retirement system of the city of detroit v indymac mbs inc  fd  d cir  “indymac” which resolved unsettled law on the application of the securities act’s statue of repose  due to changing case law as well as arguments and defenses set forth by the parties lead counsel filed two amended complaints opposed two rounds of motion to dismiss briefing from defendants and together with defendants submitted nine additional letter briefs to draw the court’s attention to eleven decisions that were relevant to issues raised in the parties’ briefing and also submitted supplemental briefing to address new issues that arose in response to changing precedent postindymac after this substantial briefing on march   the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ second motion to dismiss lead plaintiffs’ claims   eventually lead plaintiffs and defendants began exploring potential settlement in connection with those discussions the parties agreed to exchange certain information that likely otherwise would have been available to lead plaintiffs during discovery accordingly lead plaintiffs ultimately obtained over  million pages of documents and  million additional pages of loan files which required review by lead counsel on october   the parties exchanged and submitted their opening mediation statements and on october   participated in an inperson mediation session although the parties reached an impasse at the mediation settlement negotiations continued and on november   the parties executed a binding term sheet which included a cash settlement of  million the court granted final approval of the settlement on may   since that time lead counsel has continued to oversee the process of distributing net settlement proceeds to qualifying class members  lead plaintiffs

heavily involved in the subprime mortgage crisis in the years leading up to the failure bear stearns was heavily involved in securitization and issued large amounts of assetbacked securities which in the case of mortgages were pioneered by lewis ranieri the father of mortgage securities as investor losses mounted in those markets in  and  the company actually increased its exposure especially the mortgagebacked assets that were central to the subprime mortgage crisis in march  the federal reserve bank of new york provided an emergency loan to try to avert a sudden collapse of the company the company could not be saved however and was sold to jp morgan chase for  per share a price far below its precrisis week high of  per share but not as low as the  per share originally agreed upon by

management and business innovation this was the second time in three years that bear stearns had achieved this top distinction leadup to the failure – increasing exposure to subprime mortgagesedit by november  the company had total capital of approximately  billion and total assets of  billion and according to the april  issue of institutional investor magazine bear stearns was the seventhlargest securities firm in terms of total capital a year later bear stearns had notional contract amounts of approximately  trillion in derivative financial instruments of which  trillion were listed futures and option contracts in addition bear stearns was carrying more than  billion in level  assets on its books at the end of fiscal  versus a net equity position of only  billion this  billion supported  billion in assets which means a leverage ratio of  to  this highly leveraged balance sheet consisting of many illiquid and potentially worthless assets led to the rapid diminution of investor and lender confidence which finally evaporated as bear was forced to call the new york federal reserve to stave off the looming cascade of counterparty risk which would ensue from forced liquidation start of the crisis – two subprime mortgage funds failedit main article  subprime mortgage financial crisis see also subprime lending and collateralized debt obligation on june   bear stearns pledged a collateralized loan of up to  billion to bail out one of its funds the bear stearns highgrade structured credit fund while negotiating with other banks to loan money against collateral to another fund the bear stearns highgrade structured credit enhanced leveraged fund bear stearns had originally put up just  million so they were hesitant about the bailout nonetheless ceo james cayne and other senior executives worried about the damage to the companys reputation the funds were invested in thinly traded collateralized debt obligations cdos merrill lynch seized  million worth of the underlying collateral but only was able to auction  million of them the incident sparked concern of contagion as bear stearns might be forced to liquidate its cdos prompting a markdown of similar assets in other portfolios richard a marin a senior executive at bear stearns asset management responsible for the two hedge funds was replaced on june  by jeffrey b lane a former vice chairman of rival investment bank lehman brothers during the week of july   bear stearns disclosed that the two subprime hedge funds had lost nearly all of their value amid a rapid decline in the market for subprime mortgages on august   investors in the two funds took action against bear stearns and its top board and risk management managers and officers the law firms of jake zamansky  associates and rich  intelisano both filed arbitration claims with the national association of securities dealers alleging that bear stearns misled investors about its exposure to the funds this was the first legal action made against bear stearns copresident warren spector was asked to resign on august   as a result of the collapse of two hedge funds tied to subprime mortgages a september  report in the new york times noted that bear stearns posted a  percent drop in net profits due to their hedge fund losses with samuel molinaros november  revelation that bear stearns was writing down a further  billion in mortgagerelated securities and would face its first loss in  years standard  poors downgraded the companys credit rating from aa to a matthew tannin and ralph r cioffi both former managers of hedge funds at bear stearns companies were arrested june   they faced criminal charges and were found not guilty of misleading investors about the risks involved in the subprime market tannin and cioffi have also been named in lawsuits brought by barclays bank which claims they were one of the many investors misled by the executives they were also named in civil lawsuits brought in  by investors including barclays bank who claimed they had been misled barclays claimed that bear stearns knew that certain assets in the bear stearns highgrade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage master fund were worth much less than their professed values the suit claimed that bear stearns managers devised a plan to make more money for themselves and further to use the enhanced fund as a repository for risky poorquality investments the lawsuit said bear stearns told barclays that the enhanced fund was up almost  through june —when in reality the portfolios asset values were plummeting other investors in the fund included jeffrey e epsteins financial trust company fed bailout and sale to jpmorgan chaseedit on march   the federal reserve bank of new york agreed to provide a  billion loan to bear stearns collateralized by free and clear assets from bear stearns in order to provide bear stearns the liquidity for up to  days that the market was refusing to provide shortly thereafter the federal reserve bank of new york had a change of heart and told bear stearns that the day loan was unavailable to them the deal was then changed to where the ny fed would create a company to buy  billion worth of bear stearns assets two days later on march   bear stearns signed a merger agreement with jp morgan chase in a stock swap worth  a share or less than  percent of bear stearns market value just two days before this sale price represented a staggering loss as its stock had traded at  a share as late as january  and  a share as late as february  the new company is funded by loans of  billion from the new york frb and  billion from jp morgan chase the junior loan with no further recourse to jp morgan chase this nonrecourse loan means that the loan is collateralized by mortgage debt and that the government cannot seize jp morgan chases assets if the mortgage debt collateral becomes insufficient to repay the loan chairman of the fed ben bernanke defended the bailout by stating that a bankruptcy of bear stearns would have affected the real economy and could have caused a chaotic unwinding of investments across the us markets on march  securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox said the collapse of bear stearns was due to a lack of confidence not a lack of capital cox noted that bear stearnss problems escalated when rumors spread about its liquidity crisis which in turn eroded investor confidence in the firm notwithstanding that bear stearns continued to have high quality collateral to provide as security for borrowings market counterparties became less willing to enter into collateralized funding arrangements with bear stearns said cox bear stearns liquidity pool started at  billion on march  and then plummeted to  billion on march  ultimately market rumors about bear stearns difficulties became selffulfilling cox said on march   a class action was filed on behalf of shareholders challenging the terms of jpmorgan’s recently announced acquisition of bear stearns that same day a new agreement was reached that raised jpmorgan chases offer to  a share up from the initial  offer which meant an offer of  billion the revised deal was aimed to quiet upset investors and any subsequent legal action brought against jp morgan chase as a result of the deal as well as to prevent employees many of whose past compensation consisted of bear stearns stock from leaving for other firms the bear stearns bailout was seen as an extremecase scenario and continues to raise significant questions about fed intervention on april   paul a volcker stated that the fed has taken actions that extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers see his remarks at a luncheon of the economic club of new york on may  bear stearns

its funds the bear stearns highgrade structured credit fund while negotiating with other banks to loan money against collateral to another fund the bear stearns highgrade structured credit enhanced leveraged fund bear stearns had originally put up just  million so they were hesitant about the bailout nonetheless ceo james cayne and other senior executives worried about the damage to the companys reputation the funds were invested in thinly traded collateralized debt obligations cdos merrill lynch seized  million worth of the underlying collateral but only was able to auction  million of them the incident sparked concern of contagion as bear stearns might be forced to liquidate its cdos prompting a markdown of similar assets in other portfolios richard a marin a senior executive at bear stearns asset management responsible for the two hedge funds was replaced on june  by jeffrey b lane a former vice chairman of rival investment bank lehman brothers during the week of july   bear stearns disclosed that the two subprime hedge funds had lost nearly all of their value amid a rapid decline in the market for subprime mortgages on august   investors in the two funds took action against bear stearns and its top board and risk management managers and officers the law firms of jake zamansky  associates and rich  intelisano both filed arbitration claims with the national association of securities dealers alleging that bear stearns misled investors about its exposure to the funds this was the first legal action made against bear stearns copresident warren spector was asked to resign on august   as a result of the collapse of two hedge funds tied to subprime mortgages a september  report in the new york times noted that bear stearns posted a  percent drop in net

criminal charges and were found not guilty of misleading investors about the risks involved in the subprime market tannin and cioffi have also been named in lawsuits brought by barclays bank which claims they were one of the many investors misled by the executives they were also named in civil lawsuits brought in  by investors including barclays bank who claimed they had been misled barclays claimed that bear stearns knew that certain assets in the bear stearns highgrade structured credit strategies enhanced leverage master fund were worth much less than their professed values the suit claimed that bear stearns managers devised a plan to make more money for themselves and further to use the enhanced fund as a repository for risky poorquality investments the lawsuit said bear stearns told barclays that the enhanced fund was up almost  through june —when in reality the portfolios asset values were plummeting other investors in the fund included jeffrey e epsteins financial trust company fed bailout and sale to jpmorgan chaseedit on march   the federal reserve bank of new york agreed to provide a  billion loan to bear stearns collateralized by free and clear assets from bear stearns in order to provide bear stearns the liquidity for up to  days that the market was refusing to provide shortly thereafter the federal reserve bank of new york had a change of heart and told bear stearns that the day loan was unavailable to them the deal was then changed to where the ny fed would create a company to buy  billion worth of bear stearns assets two days later on march   bear stearns signed a merger agreement with jp morgan chase in a stock swap worth  a share or less than  percent of bear stearns market value just two days before this sale price represented a staggering loss as its stock had traded at  a share as late as january  and  a share as late as february  the new company is funded by loans of  billion from the new york frb and  billion from jp morgan chase the junior loan with no further recourse to jp morgan chase this nonrecourse loan means that the loan is collateralized by mortgage debt and that the government cannot seize jp morgan chases assets if the mortgage debt collateral becomes insufficient to repay the loan chairman of the fed ben bernanke defended the bailout by stating that a bankruptcy of bear stearns would have affected the real economy and could have caused a chaotic unwinding of investments across the us markets on march  securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox said the collapse of bear stearns was due to a lack of confidence not a lack of capital cox noted that bear stearnss problems escalated when rumors spread about its liquidity crisis which in turn eroded investor confidence in the firm notwithstanding that bear stearns continued to have high quality collateral to provide as security for borrowings market counterparties became less willing to enter into collateralized funding arrangements with bear stearns said cox bear stearns liquidity pool started at  billion on march  and then plummeted to  billion on march  ultimately market rumors about bear stearns difficulties became selffulfilling cox said on march   a class action was filed on behalf of shareholders challenging the terms of jpmorgan’s recently announced acquisition of bear stearns that same day a new agreement was reached that raised jpmorgan chases offer to  a share up from the initial  offer which meant an offer of  billion the revised deal was aimed to quiet upset investors and any subsequent legal action brought against jp morgan chase as a result of the deal as well as to prevent employees many of whose past compensation consisted of bear stearns stock from leaving for other firms the bear stearns bailout was seen as an extremecase scenario and continues to raise significant questions about fed intervention on april   paul a volcker stated that the fed has taken actions that extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers see his remarks at a luncheon of the economic club of new york on may  bear stearns shareholders approved the sale to jpmorgan chase at the pershare

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples
